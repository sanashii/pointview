# Point View
<p>The hospitality sector recognizes the growing significance of customer feedback in the digital era, but the challenge lies in efficiently managing the overwhelming volume of user-generated content across various online review platforms. This project emphasizes the need for a unified scoring system, "PointView," leveraging Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to transform how hotel and restaurant managers interpret and utilize consumer input. The goal is to enhance decision-making, improve services, and ultimately elevate the overall customer experience, addressing the current fragmented state of data assessment in the industry.</p>
