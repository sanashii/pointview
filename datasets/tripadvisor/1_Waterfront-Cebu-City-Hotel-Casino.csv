Jessee A,Jun 2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our Successful Graduation Ceremonies at Waterfront Hotel and Casino Cebu City,"We are just so happy with our recently concluded graduation event at  the Waterfront Hotel. We booked our event with Miss Irish and everything just went on smoothly. She was very accommodating and made sure that she’s on top of everything. The Jimei Hall is a very good spot already even if you’re already tight with your budget, coz the venue is already elegant. The staff and the service crew on the day of our event were also very polite and attentive to our concerns and instructions. The food for our snacks at the venue were also good according to our guests. If you have time, please also try their buffet lunch or dinner at Cafe Uno near the main lobby. You’d be amazed by the visual presentation and the mouth-watering flavors of their dishes. We’ll definitely come back at the Waterfront Hotel for more events. It’s a 10/10 experience. No wonder why my partner has been a client of them for 12 years already.",June 2022,Traveled on business
risabp,Jan 2020,4.0 of 5 bubbles,January Trip to Cebu,"We always book ourselves in this Hotel. Hotel Staff are friendly and are always will to accommodate any requests.  Clean, quiet, relaxing and very near shopping centers.  The only problem with our stay now is that the room (Standard King) lacks lighting and the bathroom's layout is just not right.  Door in the bathroom always hits the watercloset and shower curtain is a too short for the shower. But overall the stay was good and would still book with Waterfront but maybe get a better room.",January 2020,Traveled as a couple
Oliver K,Jan 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very good accomodation,"I stayed for 5 nights at the Waterfront Hotel during my business trip. The Hotel is very central in Cebu. The room was very nice and quite big for a reasonable price. The breakfast is outstanding and offers everything you can imaging, western breakfast, asian cuisine, etc. All wishes were looked after by the service and they were always very friendly and supportive. Will come back on my next visit.",January 2020,Traveled on business
Annalie H,Jan 2023,3.0 of 5 bubbles,You get what you paid for,"The hotel was A-ok. Breakfast and pool were my family’s primary reason why we stayed there. But, I forgot to consider connectivity aka internet. I needed to work some days, but their internet connections was horrible. I couldn’t even open a website. I complained about it and asked the front desk where I could possibly get good connections , they just responded that they couldn’t do anything since they’re fully booked! If that was the test of me keeping my job, i would have lost it. The only bright side for me is that their breakfast was great! Plus it’s not difficult to get a cab/taxi. Lesson learned: if you needed to work online, go elsewhere. It was last minute that we decided to stay for another two days and moved to Seda Bloc. Try there instead.",December 2022,Traveled with family
Monna M,Mar 2022,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Did not quite meet expectation,"We attended an event that was held at this hotel so we decided to have an overnight stay with my son. Food was good. Unfortunately, their cable was not working and their WIFI is slow that I have just used my mobile data for the entire stay. Their pool was only opened at 11 am and check out is at 12 pm. Good thing only that they allowed us to check in early and check out late as well. However, the pool was disappointing. The small slide is off limits and there were broken tiles in the kids pool, which I unfortunately saw only when my son hurt his feet (there was no notice/warning whatsoever). He cut his feet and it was bleeding. It was a bad experience for him and he even said that he did not like the hotel.",March 2022,NA
jeancoke21,Mar 2021,4.0 of 5 bubbles,great hotel,awesome and very convenient place to stay in... due to pandemic they don’t have buffet so they serve breakfast set at a very low cost and love their American style meal set. Recommended place to stay in the city.,March 2021,NA
charl0ttestuck,Apr 2021,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not satisfied,Air conditioning was a problem which made us move rooms several times. Placement of curtains in the shower was not well thought of because water would still soak the bathroom floor even if the curtain was properly closed. I would call room service or housekeeping and even operator several times and they wouldnt pick up.,March 2021,NA
TheJernyB,Jan 2020,3.0 of 5 bubbles,New Year's Eve,It's an old hotel and renovations are not yet done. It's the bathroom showerhead I cannot forgive. - The shower head was missing the body spray. You know the supposed proper chrome holes where water gets out of? The only lighting option inside the rooom is dim. - And that's turning on all the switches.,December 2019,NA

Jay,Jun 2022,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Worst Wedding I’ve Ever Been To!,"The most horrible hotel experience I’ve ever had! The lights in the room was not working so we had to use only the lamps for lights, but the room was still so dark that we ended up using the flashlights on our phones! The water in the toilet stopped working, but we all had to pee at some point, so we still peed in the toilet. Let’s just say the toilet looked like a public toilet, the ones you see in ratchet clubs at 4 in the morning, if you know what I mean. The food at the reception was horrid!!!! The food looked like it was food for the pigs!! The servers were the ones plating the food, the plates were so full of food that the sauces were mixing, the salad was mixed with the chicken and rice, the lumpia tasted like kaldereta. It was disgusting! I couldn’t even finish my food!I do NOT recommend this hotel for any events!!",June 2022,NA

Mark A,Jul 2019,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed with Quality of Hotel and SOME concierge staff,"Me, my wife and 3 year old stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks. Upon entering, the lobby area looked really nice and the concierge and reception staff were great. Check-in process was slow as there was a queue of people in line but we weren't too bothered with it. As we got to the lift area we noticed it took awhile for the lift to arrive and one of the four lifts was out of service as well. We arrived to our room and it was clear the hotel is very old and the furnishings are very outdated as well as the room amenities. Our toilet overflowed twice during our stay and also started leaking out of the cistern as the flush wouldn't stop filling. Maintenance had to be called up each time and the mess from the water spilling onto the bathroom floor wasn't cleaned properly after they finished and we had to notify housekeeping ourselves. The shower head was spraying unevenly and was also loose. If we turned up the pressure the hose would spray upward toward the ceiling splashing water everywhere. The gym is nice but also the equipment is so old and worn out. One of the machines (Lat Pulldown) was held together with a piece of fabric. I also used the leg press on one occassion and the belt snapped as i was just about to begin the exercise. It came crashing down with a loud bang and would have expected staff to come to my attention but i had to go and seek out assistance myself at the gym reception area. They told me that the machine had a faulty belt and needed replacing. They should have put it out of service rather than leaving it to snap as it could have ended in a much worse situation. The pool area looks amazing and i enjoyed the DJ music in the evening. One thing i can fault is the food service in the bar area. My wife asked what time the food service finishes and was told it finished at 9.20pm. My wife placed an order at 8.45pm and asked for items in the menu (Chicken lollipop and Spaghetti bolognese) and was told, sorry they can only serve pizza and couldn't cook anything else from the menu. Disappointing as we had friends visit us and were hoping to dine by the poolside. Housekeeping staff and also the staff at reception and the elevators were amazing. They made our stay alot better due to their friendliness and service.  One IMPORTANT issue that my wife mentioned was that some of the concierge staff were very unprofessional. We had our own vehicle so we had to validate our ticket each time we leave the hotel (which was another nuisance for us). At times when she came to validate the ticket, the concierge staff would say inappropriate comments and remarks to her which made her uncomfortable. As we had our 3 year old son with us, I was busy keeping him entertained at the lobby lounge area during the first couple of days, so i was not aware of this happening. After this occured she would ask me to accompany her always to the concierge desk. Had i known about this during our stay I would have notified to see the General Manager as this is very unprofessional and disgusting behaviour. I am hoping this review reaches the General Manager. As much as i would have liked to enjoy our stay, there were too many issues that occured. Our money would have been better spent at another hotel.",July 2019,NA

I also used the leg press on one occassion and the belt snapped as i was just about to begin the exercise. It came crashing down with a loud bang and would have expected staff to come to my attention but i had to go and seek out assistance myself at the gym reception area. They told me that the machine had a faulty belt and needed replacing. They should have put it out of service rather than leaving it to snap as it could have ended in a much worse situation. The pool area looks amazing and i enjoyed the DJ music in the evening. One thing i can fault is the food service in the bar area. My wife asked what time the food service finishes and was told it finished at 9.20pm. My wife placed an order at 8.45pm and asked for items in the menu (Chicken lollipop and Spaghetti bolognese) and was told, sorry they can only serve pizza and couldn't cook anything else from the menu. Disappointing as we had friends visit us and were hoping to dine by the poolside. Housekeeping staff and also the staff at reception and the elevators were amazing. They made our stay alot better due to their friendliness and service.  One IMPORTANT issue that my wife mentioned was that some of the concierge staff were very unprofessional. We had our own vehicle so we had to validate our ticket each time we leave the hotel (which was another nuisance for us). At times when she came to validate the ticket, the concierge staff would say inappropriate comments and remarks to her which made her uncomfortable. As we had our 3 year old son with us, I was busy keeping him entertained at the lobby lounge area during the first couple of days, so i was not aware of this happening. After this occured she would ask me to accompany her always to the concierge desk. Had i known about this during our stay I would have notified to see the General Manager as this is very unprofessional and disgusting behaviour. I am hoping this review reaches the General Manager. As much as i would have liked to enjoy our stay, there were too many issues that occured. Our money would have been better spent at another hotel.",July 2019,NA

We arrived the hotel at around 12 NN.  I requested if we can check in early but I was told NO right away and I was reminded that check in time is 2:00 PM.  Of course I know the check in time that is why I made the request for an early check in.  I would have appreciated it if reception told me that they will try their best to accommodate my request and that once our room is available, they will check us in.  That way, even if our request is really not possible, then I will feel like they have tried there best to accommodate us but to no avail rather than being told NO right away. After all, I booked for 9 nights stay and paid a good amount of money.  With the way front desk has talked with us, I did not feel like I was a valued guest of the hotel.  Reception has texted me an hour later to inform us that our room was already available and that we can check in early.  I was not happy with this as I was already upset.  Usually, when we have our vacation in Cebu, we stay in 2 different hotels, but this time we decided to just stay in Waterfront for the whole duration of our stay in Cebu.  We regretted this and we are almost sure that we will not stay in this hotel ever again.",April 2019,NA

Royce P,Apr 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,ANOTHER STAY AT WATERFRONT,"We have stayed at Waterfront Hotel  Casino at least twice a year for the past 7 years so that is enough recommendation in itself. Last year when staying at Waterfront there were issues with the pool and I’m happy to say Waterfront has taken some action to address the issues. The TV that only served as a distraction to pool staff has been removed. The pool area once again has a proper male change/shower room. Last year the large rock which once enhanced the pool area was dirty black and in urgent need of pressure washer cleaning. Most of the rock has now been cleaned but some areas still remain black. We only used the pool once this time and once again there were no towels available, although only it was certainly not busy - only a few guests were there. The towels only became available as we were leaving - too late for us. Since last year, the beach towels that never ran out have been replaced with a small quantity of bath towels that always run out. What the rationale behind this is, I can’t fathom. I might also add the air con in rooms is very good but don't bother trying to adjust the temperature dial - it has no effect. We usually turn air con off at night when sleeping as it gets too cold. Everything else was up to par and we plan to stay at Waterfront again later this year.",April 2019,NA

We traveled about 30 guests and all stayed at Waterfront. When we arrived the receptionist ment that a family of two adults and two kids 9 and 11 years old had to stay in one double bed or we had to pay extra for a bed for the children. This even though we had specified this in our booking trough Agoda. After 45 min they gave us an extra bed, children were tired after travels and we were just happy to get a room in the end. When we got to the room there was only hot water in the shower so one of the kids burned her self... They did fix the water but for me damage was done. Not going back to the hotell.

This was a celebration of valentines day and the customer service was amazing. They did not have any of the rooms with the bed I initially booked so they upgraded us to the next room which was amazing customer service and why we love staying with this hotel brand and by far Cebu is the best. The only complaint I have and not really about the hotel it is the restaurant for dinner buffet. For what you get and the price is definitely not a go to. The breakfast on the other hand is super amazing and by far the best in Cebu in my opinion.

The first night of the problem, I had to take a different elevator to the 6th floor and then walk up three additional floors (which were wet and slippery from the flood) and through water soaked carpet to reach my room. There were long waits for the elevators. I requested a refund for at least 2 of the 4 nights because of this large inconvenience, but was refused.

Lucky Daug,Feb 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Hotel With Character, History and Charm. Stayed here Several Times over 4 years","This is one of the better places I have found in Cebu City especially if you have small Children with you. They advertise themselves as a 4 star hotel and I think they meet this criteria with no problem.  The Pool area is really nice having both a nice and not very deep pool for small children and on the opposite of the bar one for adults.  Lifeguards are on duty not like other hotels and the Bar at the Pool seems to always be open during pool hours. The food is excellent but prices are quite high.  Staff and the service from the doormen to the bellmen, guards and waiter people are attentive, experienced and pay attention to giving customer service. The hotel makes you feel comfortable there.  I you happened to have any problems with booking, they usually are solved right away and they desk has excellent communication with you from the time you make your booking, even if you have not used their site to make the booking.   The rooms are very clean and they have nice linens, beds and towels.  Central air-conditioning throughout the hotel is really nice compared to most other hotels on the island which have loud room units and nothing in the hallways and corridors. This makes the rooms have a very quiet atmosphere.  The building is a Grand Structure and the large surrounding grounds have great landscape with nice plants with elegance and charm.   The security is rated good with access to the ground having guards looking in trunks and under the cars.  The doors have guards, dogs and metal detectors.  Probably one of the more secure places on the island.  The place does show its age in some areaswhich could be renovated and the Wifi is lots of times poor,with low bandwidth, these are the reasons why I did not give it 5/5 rating. I would stay here more, but lots of times they are sold out.  I highly recommend this hotel, it is not new, but is is Grand.",January 2019,NA

The breakfast was HUGE, so many you don't know what to eat first., it was like a combination of breakfast, lunch and dinner. The hotel itself has lot to offer, from restaurant, to bakeshop to casino, etc. There were also taxi in line waiting outside for those who want to  take the ride. I have no big complain about the room, though on our first night the aircon power got slowed around 4 in the morning, but it was addressed immediately when we complained.

I'm sorry but there breakfast was free  good thing because it was not that good was disappointed, after what I had the night before for supper I expected better and more choices. I would have rather ate breakfast at Joli bee.   That's why they only get 4 stars. About security again, what's up with no hats in the Casino????? STUPID STUPID STUPID.

Royce P,Dec 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,YET ANOTHER STAY AT WATERFRONTYET,"Over the past 6 years we have been regular guests at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City Hotel and Casino. This year, our 17 night November/December stay was during Christmas festivities and as usual Waterfront has put on a fantastic display of Christmas trees, decorations and lights. Buffet breakfast in UFO was very good as usual with attentive staff but sorry to say they keep running out of corn flakes. This time it happened on two separate days. We noted two other guests also complaining when none available. Next is the pool. The appearance, amenities and service in the pool area have declined. Last March, Waterfront agreed with our concerns and advised action was underway to rectify. But no action.  Still no proper male change room/shower facility available as the existing facility has been deemed unsafe for use by guests due to the very steep gradient of the stairs. If engineering department can’t come up with a solution, Waterfront needs to call in the experts. In March we noticed algae on one of the pathways surrounding the pool. This time it was worse and the reason was evident –drain blocked with stagnant water stretching about two metres. The algae was again removed during our stay. But the stagnant water remains, so more algae will develop. A licensed plumber with an electric eel is needed to unblock the drain. The yellow and white beach towels have been replaced by white bath towels. Why? Fountains and waterfalls in the pool never on when we were there. Additional umbrellas have been provided in the general pool area but the main pool area has only three umbrellas. A manager pointed out some people prefer to lie in the sun. Correct. But guests or pool staff can easily move the deck chair away from the umbrella so it is in the sun. A TV has been provided in the cabana. Waterfront management says it is for the guests. But guests don’t go down to the pool to watch TV. The only people we saw watching the TV were pool staff. The staff would be more attentive to the needs of guests without the TV. For example, we noted menu service to guests on deck chairs has ceased. The huge rock in the pool area is black. Two small sections have been cleaned, probably with a water pressure cleaner. Well why not clean the whole rock? Many tiles in the pool area need repair, replacement, cleaning or re-grouting. In conclusion, if Waterfront cares about the pool area, it needs to take action to return it to what it once was – a 5 star facility.",November 2018,NA

Bathroom is ok, however the hot water came on a full 10 minutes after turning the tap on. The glass outside the windows was filthy. The bed and covers were great however the pillows are hard with no option to have another type of pillow. Airconditioning is centralized so good luck turning the thermostat off - it doesn't work. Staff were very attentive and communicated well. Buffet at the Uno Cafe was a treat however, due to the volume of guests over the weekend we could not really enjoy the restaurant cause a lot of tourists were very noisy, did not understand English and did not know what to eat.",December 2018,NA

It was disappointing that we were not given a room with just 1 bed. We have stated in the Request Box that we do require a room with 1 bed since we are a couple anyway. What's more disappointing is that the Receptionist didn't even bother to check for room availability and just blurted out there is no other room available that night. We knew for a fact that it was not a peak season, and that there were lesser guests at the Hotel during our stay. I guess that was just our fate. the excitement of coming back to Waterfront after our wedding experience was totally disappointing.",September 2018,NA

The old renaissance style build and thick walls means you won't be troubled by screaming riff raff thumping up and down corridors and can enjoy the very comfortable, ample beds with clean linen undisturbed. Room service is excellent and you won't be disappointed in either the US or European fayre offered alongside the traditional Pinoy offerings with also some delicacies from Japan and China. Within easy reach of the airport (20 mins) or Central Cebu this gem will provide everything for the discerning business traveller and families too with its fabulous outside pool and well kept gardens.

Another bad experience was I need to send email indicated proof i'm paid and took me another 30 minutes to check in.

SimplyTraveler1990,Aug 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Awesome one week stay,"Ive stayed for a week here with my wife and the place is awesome. The room was clean and spacious. It could fit four people there. Love the interior classical design and the housekeeping is beyond exceptional. Each time i come back to my room the bed was made and toiletries has been replenished. Also i love the daily newspaper they hang on the door handle. The security guards are respectful and very nice. The front desk are welcoming especially the door people. The lobby waitreess are very patient. Especially ive stayed there sitting with my wife all afternoon at the lobby area, we both never had the pressure to order or had the impression that we are not welcome. The only complain i have is the price of the hotel transport. Which for me was abit of a scam. Its not right to charge your hotel guest with 1000php per head for hotel transfers to the airport. Its abit of a rip off espcially a taxi will only cause you less than 200php each way. For me it should be offered as a complimentary espcially for guess that are staying for more than 3 days which in our case more than a week. Anyways i love my time and enjoyed my stay in waterfront hotel. Will definetly stay there again.",August 2018,NA

trent777,Aug 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Unexpected stay,"I am reviewing the hotel not as a basis of value for money but for its facilities ameneties and services. Our stay was totally unplanned as our flight stops in Cebu and continues to Clark which should have been our only destination coming from DXB. As so the aircraft had a glitch and could not be safely operated to CRK thus getting a layover or n CEB. This was the designated hotel and upon arrival everything was completely organize for us disrupted passengers unlike the chaos that happened in the airport. Around 4 counters were opened to accept us and give us our rooms and additional info for our stay. Free mini bar, buffet all day were arranged by the airline. The hotel is still as luxurious as it can get but a bit of a nostalgic feel as this hotel is a bit old and I think it needs some refurbishments or furniture change. Room was quite big! A/c is okay, toilets have complete amenities except a bidet. No complain on the space as we had ample for our luggages. Beds were comfy and sheets were changed during the day. Wifi is average speed but available on the whole inside of the hotel. Going to their buffet restaurant I can say this changed the mood of the passengers having big tummies now instead of big headaches. Breakfast choice was wide from local to continental. Wide choices of drinks and ample comfy seats as well. Lunch and dinner had much variety but can have the same choices on both times. I think it is at par with other pricey buffet in the PH. The one thing I loved about the food is never missing about the local choices especially for Cebu delicacies! From Danggit to Lechon Belly! Going is easy as taxis were available waiting or can book a Grab taxi. Nearest mall is Ayala Center and taxi to the Sto Niño Basilica is about PHP 200 (Grab). Travel time from airport varies to 30 to 50 Mins depending on the Traffic. As expected staff are very courteous and will attend to your every query. Staff kept informing us about our new flight time with notes and by calling our room. I can say that the hotel had at least lessen the worrisome and burden that the disruption has brought to us by providing the care we need away from our home. Im sure your stay will be a value for your money and might even exceed your expectation.",June 2018,NA
chandrachur,Aug 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Average stay at Cebu,What puts down the average is the condition of the rooms. You can make out that the rooms are old.

Upon entering the lobby you will be welcomed by its grandiosity. Hotel staff are friendly. But one staff did’nt make it. Their receptionist. We still waited a little bit longer since the room that we booker AHEAD is not yet available, so we talked with the receptionist if he can give us any room that is available and we will just pay additionally, and so we have the room. Although he is good, he made a bigger mistake by giving us a WRONG keycard. And so Upon opening the room, with much delight we are surprised that there is somebody inside the room! The guest is still putting his pants on!! Imagine the shame on our faces!!! And so My husband got really mad!and so we explain to them that the receptionist gave us the wrong keycard, luckily the other guest understand us. Although the receptionist offered his apologies, we gladly accepted it. But there is no excuses when it comes to this kind of Situation, coordination is a must.

I went to the front desk and spoke to the manager the situation.  She check the computer and found out that the front desk lady Lauren overcharged me means she charged me doubled.  The manager promised that they will give me a credit on my card but until now its been 1 month and 9 days no credit was recorded in my account.  They also promise me that they will email me to update me the situation , but no email was sent to me until today.  It was so discouraging .

Upon arrival we were immediately thanked for our coming to there hotel  were upgraded to a suite as they has given away our original room due to our late arrival...Well the suite was massive, extravagant, elegant, clean  just very cool I must say...Washroom was huge, clean, neat  loved the rainfall showerhead. We got cleaned up  went to the Italian restaurant downstairs  then spent a few hours at the casino....We booked here from Canada thru Hotels.com (85.Cdn, would easily be a $300 - $350/ night room in Canada)   I would highly recommend anyone going to Cebu to stay here. We left at 3am for the airport  they already had a taxi standing by for us which was about $10cdn....I wish I could have spent a whole day/night or longer here but for sure next time were staying here. I've seen nothing else like it in Philippines or even in Canada for that matter. Lobby, shops, ATM, casino all seemed very massive in size  there was a lot of people but just didn't have that busy hustle  bustle feeling to it....Front desk staff, wake up call everything was just great.

affirmativecarehome,Jun 2018,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Lack of Remorse,"We checked in on May 26, 2018 for 1 night and we had the executive room. Since we arrived past midnight, we were not able to enjoy the amenities that goes with it. That was fine since it's our doing that it happened. We checked out Sunday because we had a reservation at Shangrila Hotel in Mactan for 1 night. Monday came and we decided to go back to Waterfront Lahug for 1 night. The reason why we can't decide ahead of time is because we have an accommodation from a cousin that is in Honeyville II Quiot, Pardo. The only reason why we want to stay in a hotel is because we hated to drive through all that traffic. So, we booked for 1 night and found out that we had a smaller room than the executive room we had on Saturday so we told the receptionist that we will just booked one more night and we would like to have the executive room then but the receptionist said that for our convenience might as well just stayed on the same room that way we don't have to bother to move to another room. So, we took her advice and just booked the same room only to find out that the following day the whole floor that we are in has to be moved out because they are repainting the whole floor which is the 6th floor. We were not happy about it so we went down to the receptionist/front desk but all they said is they were not aware that they're going to repaint that day.  We found that ridiculous because painting is not a minor task that pre planning is not considered. What is upsetting is the lack of emotion or to even lift a finger to do something about it. Why is it that they don't have the coordination that way your guest will understand the situation.",May 2018,NA

The other group said to us that their hotel tour guide (waterfront employee) left them in the lobby for minutes without saying where she is going and another hotel staff told them to move aside because they're blocking the other guests' way. Their hotel guide left 25 students in the lobby, not knowing where to go next, my classmates stood their for minutes and they don't have a sit because it was taken by other guest. If the hotel staff didn't leave them their, then their lobby wouldn't be crowded and they will not be BLOCKING the other guests' way. Everyone's very disappointed. It's their fault why it's crowded because their hotel tour guide left them. Their hotel guide was very unprofessional unlike the hotel guide we had at JPark, Marco Polo, and Shangri-La. Another thing happened, during our occular inspection, we were wearing dresses because we also had our fine dining here, one of my classmate wore a long dress and an employee of this hotel stepped on her gown and my classmate fell on the floor, the employee quickly said a very cold sorry then walked away quickly like nothing happened.

ipayne2008,Feb 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Our Stay at the Waterfront Hotel Cebu to Celebrate my husbands 64th birthday,"My experience with the front desk was not that good. We arrived at the hotel early and upon check in we were told that check in time is 3pm. That we understand so we went to the lobby after checking in and have breakfast. The food was good by the way. We waited until 3pm and I went to the front desk to check on the status of our room. The guy told me that the Supervisor is doing a final check and should be calling him shortly. I sat in front of him until 3:20pm and ask if the room is ready. Again the answer was the "" Supervisor is still checking the room. I was getting impatient already so I asked the guy when is the room going to be ready it's past 3pm. I asked him is the Supervisor replacing the carpet and it takes all this time to just do a final check? He just looked at me and went to the guy at the end of the desk and  finally he came back the room was finally ready. I think if the check in time is 3pm the room should be check by the supervisor prior to 3pm. We were not able to check in the room until 3:25Pm. If you stay late on the check out they will charge you a fee why is it okay for the supervisor to take this long to just do a  final check. I would say ""First impression is lasting"" unfortunately I have a bad first impression. I don't think I will be staying in this hotel again. The food at the restaurants were pretty good. The staffs at the restaurant were all very attentive and helpful specially Ruel, Remar and the lady at the egg station (I forgot her name) she was very helpful and friendly.

Mike S,Feb 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Needs an upgrade,"i stayed for a night and got a standard room on the 11th floor. the lobby and reception was good and the check in was efficient. i was greeted by friendly staff and so i was expecting to have the same when i get to my room. the moment i leave the elevator, i can already smell old carpet and upholstery. i get to my room and i put my things down and i immediately took a shower. the bathroom was clean but the toiletries were a disappointment. i opened two toothpaste sets but couldn’t open the toothpaste with the pointed cap. i had to open it with my ballpoint pen. the cotton swabs box was there but had no swabs inside. the shower head was spraying water to the wall and not my head and it looked like it hasn’t been cleaned in awhile. the bed was clean and had 4 pillows. enough to sleep in but not looking forward to it. the aircon was comfy and cool. the room design and accents really need an upgrade as it looks really dated. the breakfast had good selection both local and foreign cuisine. there was a heap of bacon that i really liked and an egg station. overall, i wouldn’t recommend staying unless you really have to. there are basic expectations from a hotel that you should expect and even that was not met. unless they make sure the basic expectations are met and upgrade their facilities, the new hotels will eat up their clients.",February 2018,NA

I specially give many thanks to Damon who is one of security staff at night shift on Feb 5th and another security staff was nice, name was Mitch?? I don't remember his name exactly. Both of them have good service mind and willing to answer all my question. It was nice to know them.  I was disappointed with front staff.

They said there was a waterfall in the pool but there was none or it was not working. In the italian restaurant they tried to take our plates and glasses away before we were even finished, without even asking us. In the casino upstairs they had a theatre with a live performance going on, i wanted to look and the security man handled me before even walking inside and ask me where am i going and i told him to see the show then he let me in....what is this? where else does he think i am going? there was only one door on that corridor.

The breakfast for the last two days were awesome. Buffet breakfast was good they got mostly filipino cuisine. I was looking for lechon but there's nothing in the breakfast. Good place to escape for the whole year's work load. Unwind in the pool and massage centre, try to enjoy in casino and have fun for not spending too much money. Just have to improve the bathroom coz the bowl's flush has to be improved. Attendants must pay attention and not laughing all the time or chatting since alot of people are coming in and out. When we check out, I left my belt so the receptionist on the desk were called somebody in the hotel room to check if everything is clear in our room but I ddnt get anything and I remembered my belt when I was in the airport. So,unlike other hotels small things matter before they let their guests checkout completely. No grab or uber assistance if we do not want a taxi. Totality, it was a very good hotel.",December 2017,NA

pietermarchant,Dec 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Gracious lady in the deco style,"This is a beautiful hotel. A gracious lady, though built in 1998, has the style and appearance of the 1930s. From the marble floors to the chandeliers. The staff are friendly and courteous and there is a great selection of restaurants ... our favourite is UNO where an all-you-can-eat buffet is less than AUD20. We were in a deluxe room which included a small table and chairs and cost just over AUD100 on a special deal through Agoda. We  would especially mention the comfort of the beds ... we woke up refreshed having had a good night’s sleep. We would mention, however, that this place has suffered from lack of attention for some years  ... the bathrooms need attention or upgrading and suffer from lack of exhaust fans. Expect the mirrors to fog up if running hot water. If close to the lift, you might find the room a little noisy. And the exterior could do with a spruce up with a paint brush. On the upside the air conditioning is exceptional and we had to turn it to its lowest setting to avoid freezing 🙂. Fortunately, the hotel was recently returned to local ownership and we expect major undertakings to return this once stunning hotel to its former glory and, thus, we have still given it 5 stars. Despite the works to be undertaken, we still recommend this hotel. We really loved our week at The Waterfront.

The food is ok but they do illegal practices. I ordered a bottle of wine at US $ 28 on the menu but the waiter told me that the price was US $ 31. I point out to him that the price on the menu is 28 and he must respect it,  without success. I ask to speak to the supervisor who also confirmed that the price indicated on the menu is not correct. What a surprise?? I tell them that it is illegal not to respect the price indicated but they didn’t change their mind. I complained immediately at the reception of the hotel who sends the manager who apologized but did nothing to correct the situation. So I resigned myself to drinking water since I was so mad.

The towels are just for two person and we did not also asked for additional towels for the kids as there might be additional charges. This is also our fault that we did not try to ask. I hope there can be prior information from the staff, that in case we will need more towels or pillows, it can either be free of charge or for a fee. This way, the guest  will have pre knowledge on the policy, rather than be content on existing provision.For the security also, in many hotels or condominium, the elevators are equipped with RFID card readers.

John T,Mar 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good, room to improve","In reading the other reviews here, I find many of the points made - good and bad - to be accurate. In many ways, this is really a superb hotel in Cebu - location great to IT Park if you have business there, convenient to Ayala mall, and a large, green property distinctly set away from the dusty urban world of Cebu. The hotel offers many food choices, and other excellent amenities including the exercise space and swim pools. Could it be better? Very much so. I agree that the rooms are not really at the level of the pricing or what the quality of the general hotel suggests - tiles in my room had cracks, also little hot water in the shower, and the room itself was fairly uninspiring in decoration and really much more like a plain box with a small TV, although the size was good. The breakfast I had was good in variety and quantity of food, but some of the food also fell flat in taste, which i expected better in a hotel chock full of higher end restaurants. So... I find the general experience good, but falling short of the price point and exuding a slight air of either GM disorganisation to take care of maintenance, budget and assign for interior refresh, and exercise QC over room service foods. Given the luxury of the space and aspiration of the architecture and general ambiance, the reality behind the curtain is just a bit short. Would I go back? Yes... it's still a very unique property and the negs are mostly outweighed by the positives.",March 2017,NA

We found it here at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City. From stepping out of our taxi upon arrival I knew we were being treated like we were significant, and the staff was concerned about it's guests. I could commend so much about the hotel that I could write far too much about it. So, I will just highlight on a minority of points that briefly comes to my mind. Being accommodated at check-in and taken to our wonderful room which was adorned with everything we needed. The laundry service which we really needed from our long unintended travel. So comfortable, so relaxing. The one of several restaurants, the Uno, is what we chose because we wanted a variety where we could pick out a meal that was pleasing to our palate and provide a well-balanced nutritional dinner. It was all there. One thing I wished they had because I am diabetic is iced tea without sugar with lemon flavor. It was the only thing that was missing for me. But as we dined next to our Korean neighbors we both received a surprise. The head waiter I supposed, brought both of us a complimentary dish of king crab. One of my wife's and I's favorites! Everything was there from Sushi, grilled fillet of several species of fish that was so delicious it melted in my mouth. The place made both of us wish we could stay longer and try out, at least, some of the rest of the cuisine. Before dinner we shopped at the Duty-free store and the saleswoman that assisted us helped us find the best purchase for our money of what interested us. She waited till we were finished shopping and accommodated us at the cashier who was a bit too rude. We just shook that off and smiled at our sales lady as we departed and she smiled back. And after dinner back to our quiet room for some well-needed sleep. And I've hardly been there and I am ready to praise the hotel and uphold it's reputation. I'm sure I will have more to praise before we have to leave. Really hope we could stay a few days longer. But each day brings uncertain developments in my business. Who knows......Maybe.",February 2017,NA

One hour of waiting with several follow ups over the phone. We were moved to an alleged JUNIOR SUITE which was nothing compared to the Ambassador's suite.  The manager insisted that that was an upgrade. My husband and I were very disappointed.  Upon check out, my husband talked to the manager and as consolation we were given 3,000.00 pesos discount for all the inconveniences, disappointments and barely 6 hours of stay in the room. We would have rather paid the full amount instead of having gone through all the hassles and exhaustion.

I love that they have restaurants inside the property. I also used their carservice by Mabuhay and the drivers were nice, courteous and honest. This is important to me because i had a bad experience last October 2016 with the carservice I used with Marriott.

Royce P,Nov 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Waterfont Hotel - Decorated Magnificently for Christmas,"Well firstly I must say we are regulars at Waterfront staying twice a year for the last 4 years. So clearly we really like this hotel. It is very close to IT Park which has many restaurants and Waterfront has a free shuttle bus going to Ayala Mall and SM Mall. Be sure and ask for timetable when checking in. But there were a few different things we noticed this time.  The pool is great  but the rock needs attention - its black and unsightly. The bacon served at Buffet breakfast  on too many occasions was hard, cold and inedible. I would suggest Waterfront puts out half the quantity of cooked bacon and replenishes it in twice the time. We occasionally had meals served in room. One time it was barely warm. On the next occasion when ordering I stressed that the meal last time was almost cold and to please make sure its hotter when delivered this time. Well my request fell on deaf ears as the meal was absolutely cold. I realise that food delivered to rooms will not be piping hot because of the time taken in delivery, but this was so cold I reckon it was cold when it left the kitchen. Surely a simple solution would be to microwave the meal for 30 seconds just before delivery. Because of this I have marked down service. Overall our 11 night stay was great and we will return.",November 2016,NA

Even the soap which I wanted to used to shower was terrible and I could not use it properly as it did not even lather. When I wanted to check out the queue was 40 mins. This is ridiculous.

I didn't think anything of it. When I checked out, it was discovered that there was also a long distance phone call made from my room and they were trying to charge me for it. I tried to nicely tell the duty manager that I never made that call.... But we wound up arguing (in a heated manner)for almost an HOUR over that. I had proof I was at the American consulate during the time in question and did not make the call, but that woman was hell-bent on proving me wrong. Long story short, somebody forcebly entered my room, and made a phone call, I guess while they were rummaging through my stuff. The manager went so far as to call the long distance number to verify who made the call... It wasn't me!! but I guess an employee, because there were multiple security guards and managers involved (all speaking a different language I couldn't understand )in this situation once they released my deposit and let me go. I never once received an apology for the misunderstanding, only a smug look from 3 women with their arms crossed.

Counter staff are very proffessional and helpful. We are on a small budget, so since we are a walk-in costumer accomodation via walk-in would really cost us. So when we tried finally manage to get the room cost, we are a bit hesitant because of our tight budget, so we thought about walking out and find a much more reasonable price for us. Since were just gonna stay in the hotel to leave our things and sleep over for the night . Instead of letting us go, counter gave us a tip to book online to save a bit. So we did!

I waited 30 minutes in the line while the receptionist helped 2 other people that did not stay in line. Once I was at the desk, she called the room attendant for clearance, but soon informed me that one face towel was missing. It was so ridiculous because I noticed that there was only one face towel since the first day and I did not even bother to use it.

My 3 nights stay has been relaxing and comforting to say the least to my clients who are now business partners after a cup of coffee at their well lighted lobby. Never tried their gym and pool though but I presume its divine too.

Staff used to be friendly and helpful. The thing that really annoyed me the most was queueing up for over 30mins to checkout. There were 2 staff only checking people out at peak time and I counted 6 other computers that could been used. The worst part was that there were only a few people ahead of me in the line. One of the ladies that was checking out, one by one her friends would come down from their rooms and jump the queue and join her at the check-out. I complained to the staff when it was finally my turn that I had to wait 30 mins, and she said ""Sir I just checked out 13 rooms!"" No apology whatsoever. I replied ""Yes I know, and only 1 of them was ahead of me in the queue"". It was infuriating. I don't know if this is standard procedure but  it seemed she was either happy to do this - or didn't have the courage to tell them to join the queue. Her refusal to acknowledge me after that or even look me in the eye indicated to me she knew she hadn't done the right thing. Also, the day before at 6.30am I requested an iron to be brought to my room so I could iron my shirt for a meeting. By 8.30am when I left it still hadn't been brought up. I had to wear a crinkled shirt.The rooms are so outdated, there is nowhere to charge even a phone without moving furniture. I only stayed 2 nights this time and was very disappointed.",July 2016,NA

Didz Ybanez,Jun 2016,1.0 of 5 bubbles,terrible experience,"While all the other hotels that I’ve visited welcomed me with a pleasant greeting, such as a “Good morning” or a “Good evening”, my experienced between 7PM to 7:30PM last June 17th, in this hotel, was terribly an unforgettable one. Coming from IT Park, I walked across the street, and along with 3 other people on the walkway, I passed by the guard's house. The guard, then singled me out, even if I already passed few steps, called my attention and impolitely asked ""Sir, where are you going?"" For all my life, going back and forth to this hotel, it was my very first time to be asked such question. I found the question and the manner it was questioned degrading and humiliating. And so I responded, ""I am going to the Port. Am I not allowed to dine in there?"" and then walked away. After some few steps, the guard then commented ""What if I won't allow you to enter?"" and so I came back and ask him, “What did you say?” But then there were already few cars that lining up to enter that needs to be inspected, so I walked away, since I don’t want to cause some traffic to the main road. The incident left me wondering, is it because I was just entering by foot that I have to be treated that way? Or is it because I was just wearing jeans and shirt that he had to single me out among the others. Definitely, I would recommend avoiding this hotel if you not going in by taxi or by car, or you might suffer the humiliation that I had to experience.",June 2016,NA

Room was ok but everything looked tired especially the bathroom. Good thing the water pressure was really good, it was the only saving grace for me. Aircon was good and bed was ok but starting to feel too soft for being old. Carpets inside the room and in the hallway have seen better days. When we arrived at the hotel there was no concierge that met us hence we took our suitcase all the way to the reception area. There was a nelson in the hotel driveway writing god knows what but couldnt even utter a word to welcome guests. Receptionist were not very welcoming and were stucked up women. I was standing on the counter and was greeted with a ""yes ma'am?"" in a tone of ""what do you want?"" So im afraid all your receptionist particularly  rheena needs a re-training on welcoming guests. We arrived early and the room was not yet ready so we were asked to come back. We asked if we could leave our luggage and was told to take it up with concierge but the counter was empty. No concierge to be found. For such a huge hotel you lack people in your concierge department. It was pathetic!. From the day we checked in to the time we checked out your hotel hardly had any concierge staff to be find. We have to constantly asked your receptionist to call for the concierge. Hence i refused to give them a tip for they were not worth it!

Me and my fiancé was really lucky that we had stayed in an Executive suite given by the hotel staff as a free room upgrade. The hotel lobby was grandeur, very spacious and well-maintained. There was a casino in the 2nd floor, Duty free and Victoria Secret boutiques in the ground floor. There was an Island souvenir which sold Cebu t-shirts, ref magnets etc. and there was an ATM inside the hotel. There were 4 restaurants inside as well so very convenient if you don't want to go out. Our room was huge with a separate sala with TV, complete kitchen facilities and restroom. In our main bedroom, there were separate bathroom with bathtub and TV as well. It looks like we were living in our condo so I must say that our stay was really homey and refreshing. Since it was our 5th time in Cebu, we opt to really stay in the hotel and maximize their services. We ordered room service which was practical than going out to Malls since the service and food was enticing. We also tried their dinner buffets which was not too pricey considering the various selections of food. The gym was average with a boxing ring and free Zumba and swimming pool was also ok. They were both located at the lower level of the hotel. The hotel is also near Ayala Center Cebu. They really value their guests even there was a convention at that time we stayed (I am also one of the delegates of the convention), they treated their hotel guests with utmost importance and made them more comfortable by providing separate entrance door for delegates and hotel guests. Even though the lobby was jampacked with people (guests and delegates), the hotel can really accomodate such crowd. No wonder several huge events were conducted in this place.

All she had  to do was get the room cards I was surrendering and give us the pass for the Security so we could leave the hotel. I also observed that if UNO  Restaurant  gets to be filled up by hotel guests during breakfast, other guests were directed to proceed to the Chinese Restaurant., where the choices of food were  limited, food refills were slow in coming and the cutlery was not even wrapped in a cloth napkin like in UNO.

Our De luxe room on the 16th floor was nicely appointed with a good view of the city. Airport service by the hotel is quite pricey at P800 for a one way service. One may just take a white taxi from the airport (metered) and will not cost you more than P300. Food and beverages at the hotel is very expensive though. A bottle of water (Nature Spring-500ml) cost an outrageous P130 with VAT!The hotel though is well recommended for families and business people. Swimming pool and gym are very much appreciated.

We do not have one available, and 3. The microwave draws so much power that it will blow circuits. I even volunteered purchasing a unit for use in our room but was told it was not allowed.  Being that the microwave was going to be utilized for the baby's equipment and food preparation, my last recourse is to move Team Donaire into another hotel.  This is when Ms. Irene, duty manager for the hotel stepped in and made things happen.  In a matter of hours she was able to get delivered and installed a usable unit.  Overall experience in this hotel was very good except for this. Had numerous contact with managers regarding the crib and microwave but the ball was drop.

I like the frand lobby of this hotel and the outside area.  The italian reataurant la gondola is good and specially to sit outs9de and eat pizza islf weather is good.  Treff is good there for having late night beer.Staff is friendly in this hotel and also the hotel taxi service.Will stay there for sure next time when i  there.,February 2016,NA

Don't pay up front for shuttle service as they are hopeless. When we were leaving Waited for 50min for the airport shuttle paid in full and it never showed. Had take taxis or we would of missed our plane. which cost a third of what they charge for a van!!! The hotel has not even bothered to contact me with a refund!! It was a great stay.

DESimpson_1958,Apr 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A good time was had by all!,"Overall, this was a pretty fun vacation, and the Waterfront Hotel was a great location to explore Cebu City from. Only drawback is there is no beachfront. Was also very safe - I'd read a number of stories in advance related to crime that caused me to reconsider, but we had no issues anywhere. We cabbed to various malls, night clubs and tennis evnues; and island hopping for a day was exceptional. Pool was quite nice when not overrun by screaming kids. My only real complaint/recommendation is for the hotel to get a stop light installed at the hotel entrance so people who want to walk over to IT Park (and restaurants and Starbucks) can cross the street without risking their lives.",March 2016,NA

They served delicious food everyday!  Only reason I did not give full 5-star rating is because of the cigarette smoke smell in the hallway and into our hotel room.  The floor we stayed in was non-smoking room but every night, the smell would come in through the vents in the bathroom and it's like staying at a smoking room/floor.

Paul H S,Mar 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,First Class Stay,"In March 2016 We had the fortune to stay at the Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino.  For a few dollars more we stayed on the 18th Floor with access to the Ambassador Lounge.  Every morning we were provided with an excellent breakfast and we wound down the day with drinks and appetizers.  Mark, Mike, Wildan and Joyce in the lounge made sure our every need was met and advised us on things to do in Cebu.  Plenty of choices for restaurants within the hotel.  The casino is huge...can't relate much there as we are not gamblers.   As we were on vacation, an evening swim in the hotel pool was just perfect.  The entire hotel staff was super friendly from the duty management (Sevnar and Abby) to the bell hops.  Even the sales person in the souvenir gift shop (Liezl) was a superb ambassador for the hotel.  Nice duty free shop in the hotel lobby and we stocked up on chocolate for our Filipino family.  I guess we are dog lovers...we enjoyed being greeted at the entrance by Jessica and Jinky and their handlers Mikel and Darrel.  They provided an extra element of security and a friendly greeting.  We like to exercise in the morning and felt entirely safe walking around the large property and the adjacent IT Park.  Inadvertently I dropped my cellphone in a taxi that promptly took off.  The duty managers and the security staff (Jonathan Dapuyen, Elmer Besidas and others) immediately organized an effort to get the phone back.  After about 3 hours a friendly (and honest) taxi driver showed to report that he had found the phone.  Hurrah for an honest man.  Cebu is a large city and for about 200 pesos you can go virtually anywhere by taxi to include the airport.  Great hotel, great staff and wonderful vacation.",March 2016,NA

The door swings towards you when you're using the toilet. The breakfast buffet was good but not great. It had a good variety of dishes but some weren't cooked properly like the bacon and the sausage.

The minor issue continues to be the reception desk where the check in was again too laborious and long winded, it took well over 10 mins to check in and does not make for a great first impression. The housekeeping is of a very high standard- the team here need to be commended as this is not easy given the age of the room. The FB is very good, the team are very friendly particularly in UNO restaurant where the breakfast buffet is staffed by excellent friendly staff, in particular our favourite lady on the egg station who is so friendly and accommodating to our young son. The only observation here is that the breakfast buffet whilst extensive is very much geared to the predominantly Korean clientele. Pool is excellent, the team here could do with a little guidance on being proactive as most of their time is spent hanging out at the bar, checking their phones and curiously the young lady who gives out the towels spends most of her time sitting in the cupboard?Over all very good again, one disappointing note was that I had highlighted to the reservations team that this was our honeymoon, which was acknowledged during confirmation but not mentioned at all during our stay, I wasn't expecting much but a mention during our stay would have been a nice personal touchWe will stay again when next in Cebu",February 2016,NA

This was my 25th wedding anniversary and yes very disappointed to check in to a twin bed . I'm giving the laundry department a minus mark for excessive use of bleach. The linens and towels needs extra rinse. Bleach is very dangerous to the lungs. The Uno rest. crew were excellent and so were ambassador lounge crew.

The room decor is very tired, the shower water is never better than lukewarm and you would need to be 5ft tall to fit under the shower head.

I stayed here in this hotel expecting the best service. My 6D5N stay way was going smooth but during our 3rd night we decided to order at the lobby for a cold drink. Since the table is still to be cleaned, we asked the lady at the bar to clean and to give us menu. Waiting for the next 25 minutes without cleaning the table and no menu, we decided to go up to the room and report the incident to the duty manager. I spoke to her (the manager) to tell I was disappointed. Not only me, another table waiting to be served go out also since no one is assisting.The manager ask us to go down again to the lobby to serve us but it is too late. I just reported the incident. To sum it all, if you want to relax at have a good time at the lobby bar, expect the worse service, since it is Sinulog, I noticed that the girls on duty are not that kind I expected from this hotel. Better go out if you want to be served. Poor customer assistance at the lobby bar. Dont go there if you want to be pissed off.",January 2016,NA

The bathroom is very tiny and allows only to enter one person at the time. The amenities are of low quality and limited in variety. It’s a petty since the bath room is so tiny a bath tub is installed instead of a shower which would be more convenient and would take less space. We were asking for two single beds which are quite narrow and with awful uncomfortable mattresses.  My wife and myself were always suffering from back pain in the morning. The cleanliness generally is ok.The breakfast buffet in the restaurant UNO has a lot of choices of all kinds of warm and cold food. The only critics we have is that after a few consecutive days you get a bit fed-up, because the change of the variety is almost inexistent.Our verdict: This hotel is very big and lacking some coziness. We would rate this hotel as lower 4 Star hotel.Read more",December 2015,NA

mariateresitacanlas,Nov 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Frequent Guest,"Last June I stayed in a Junior Suite Room. Of course everything should be at best since I paid almost 8K per night. Toilet still not so clean. July I was there too with the same type of accommodation, suite room. It is not advisable to book in this hotel when there is a big event. They give priority to the big delegation and having other guest like me suffered for going farther exit end entry door. No one is in charge to even carry your luggage and you cannot even drop or get a cab right in front of the hotel. I think this is too unfair since I am also a hotel guest. Again, toilet cleanliness has not improved.Three days ago I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights in a De Luxe Room. Since there is no much number of guest they could give extra consideration. I was allowed to have late check out. I think this is just fine since I stayed in the hotel for sleep only and the whole day I am out of the hotel from 7:00am and back at 7:00pm.

And check out also went very smoothly. Nice security in parking as well.

We went here basically because the basic room rate was price acceptable and our son wanted nothing for his birthday but to go for a swim which the hotel has a pool as a feature.  We had so much family time here.  Nice pool venue, excellent food for restaurants inside the hotel. Although, I would suggest that you improve your massage service.  I call in for a room massage service and the receptionist I spoke with said my assigned receptionist would call me so I waited almost until midnight with no call back.  I don't what's her name, sounded like a guy's name starting with a letter ""R"".  Also, the person I spoke with for a room reservation said the price was like 4+ plus for a room which was no biggie but then I have to hang up because I have to consult my husband and on the 2nd time we call in and my husband was the one who took over the 2nd conversation that's when another agent said the room rate was P3k something. Although, we don't have problem with how much really the price as it is a bit cheap, I'm just saying, your receptionist sounded unprofessional and lack knowledge of the rates of the room. She better knows her craft well.  Good thing, I'm lousy at remembering name so I can't really say who they were but nevertheless, overall it is still a nice hotel and I'm thinking of dining here with the entire family for a Christmas dinner.

They can improve on the free breakfast served. I stayed there for 4 days and it was practically the same set of meals for 4 days. I know it is free but I hope they put a bit of creativity and new meals at least every other day. The curb that intersects the main street just near the Waterfront signage is a security risk. The walkway suddenly disappears and one needs to walk near the road then turn right for the pedestrian crossing. This spot, at night time becomes a blind spot. It is a safety hazard especially for foreigners who don't know much of Philippine traffic behavior and pedestrian nuances, Please find a way so that people from the hotel can see beforehand the on-coming vehicles, whether you put down that concrete signage of Waterfront and replace with a big enough walkway or pedestrian concave mirrors, be creative and take heed on this. Another one is how hard it is to cross that stree from Waterfron to IT park. Would it be possible to put your own security guards or concierge who's task is to assist your guest crossing that street.

movie21,Sep 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good experience at Waterfront,"I stayed for four nights. I had a good experience. I used the non-smoking room and then didn't feel the smell of smoking. That was great for me. And the service mans (Kuyah as in Philippine) are all nice. However, some front desk quys are very blunt and unsociable. You need to be careful. If u feel uncomfortable, just request the different guy to check in or out so on. The provoking attitude will be changed quickly. The outdoor pool were great to enjoy the swimming because there are a few people compared to the size of pool. Maybe I guess most customer usually enjoy the other life, such as gambling in hotel, shopping at near big malls and water activities at near Island. Whatever, that was very good for me. And the gym facilities are clean and well equipped. They also have emergency pharmacy with nurse (not free). I used this service to remove some pains which are caused by jelly fish during diving. The nurse gave one pill (anti histamine) to remove my allergy from jelly fish. It was good but a little bit sleepy. And one of best things are that you can get a taxi very very easily. Every taxi drivers knows this hotel well and preferred to go to the hotel. That was a great for the customers who didn't rent a car. Ah~, there are a particular rule about guest included your friends who are not stay in this hotel. Usually after dinner time, if u want to invite the guest to ur room, u need to pay one thousand peso (around 23-5 USD) per guest. That rule is such a suck for inviting friends, who are staying in different places, to drink together.",September 2015,NA

The hotel's amenities and cleanliness of the halls and rooms have improved a lot since I last stayed there in 2012.  But the horrible customer service is what I will remember. Housekeeping, front desk and restaurant staff seemed to be held to very low performance standards. Housekeeping staff ignore my attempts to help the environment when I follow their instructions to hang towels if you do not need them to be replaced. They just change it anyway. When I get into my room at night, they set the thermostat at 10 degrees...not environment-friendly at all. I got a call from housekeeping around 2am confirming that I was asking for new towel -- I did not ask for new towels. He dialed the wrong room number.. small error that awoke me from my badly needed sleep. Front desk clerk was annoyed when I complained about bad internet (everyone else in our meeting was complaining), and she said I'm the only one who complained. Her advise for me to turn my device on and off, even if the error message indicated that their network cable should be reconnected. She generously offered to call their tech person who was not onsite (they had no IT tech person on site!!!), and that person was insisting that the problem was not with their system, and was with my device. Note; I read him the error message I was getting: ""Network cable not connected...etc."" Yet he was insisting the problem was with my iPhone and my MacBook. My colleague from NZ who had nut allergies asked the restaurant server whether the dish he was about to order had nuts, he asked three times, and all three times the server said it had no nuts. When the food was served, one bite and he started getting rashes... the dish had nuts!  Checking out was not only slow, but miserable.

Rocky C,Jul 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great Hotel, but Not Car Friendly","Room: Spacious, comfortable bed, cool smoke free areasBathroom: Lighting a little low. The shower is a bathtub combination. The bottom of the tube is shaped like a U and is difficult to stand in. Also the tub is elevated and you have to literally climb inside. Made for the nimble.Parking: This place looks like a castle and has a roadway similar to an airport with its own security gate check points to get in. Various roads lead to check in, parking, restaurants, etc. We tried to drive and stop at check in but when we got out of the car the security told me I could not leave the car there for check in.  Our choices were drop off baggage to concierge and drive back around the complex to the parking lot, or varlet parking.  We choose to drop off bags and park.  Parking goes several layers underground and requires winding your way through many staircases to get to the check in desk. The check in desk is a busy place and we waited about 20 minutes to get to the desk.  It was 1 PM and we were told to come back at 2 PM (Check in time).  Each time we came back to the hotel we were given a new parking ticket that had to be taken to the check desk (10 to 30 min wait each time) and signed by one of the people. Food: Several restaurants serve many varieties of food.  The morning buffet breakfast was very good. They try to set up for all the Asian Cultures.  We agreed the buffet was the best we had at any Philippine Hotels.Read more",July 2015,NA
Eunice QB,Jul 2015,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible. Just terrible.,"Our group had a terrible experience at the Waterfront Cebu City Hotel  Casino from the very beginning till the end. It started with our airport pick up, we waited a long time for the van. There was none booked for us, when I had specific instructions about this in our email. It was a bit frustrating as we were tired from a previous event we had the evening prior our trip to Cebu. The room was dusty and has a foul smell, like mold. We were too tired to switch rooms or report to housekeeping. Fastforward to check out, we had a problem with the billing. Since a lot of us from our company was booked there for an event, for some reason the person from the front desk charged everything to my account without my knowledge! Imagine the hustle when I was checking out! Thats not all! To top it up, no van was arranged for us during out check out! When I booked for is days before we arrive. Terrible! Just terrible!",July 2015,NA

None of them even greeted me to welcome my arrival. It took hours and hours to complete the check-in process. The front desk staff didn't even look at me in the eye when conversing, didn't even ask about how my trip was. The room is old, shower head is busted I ternet connection is so slow. There is no bar except inside the casino that smells like ashtray. While at the restaurant at the casino the waiters are not attentive and are sitting down with people playing at slot machine rather than looking after their guests at the restaurant. Here is the worst part, the staff of the hotel gives the above treatment to local Filipinos but not to foreigners! The staff pay close attention to prostitutes going in and out, maybe to get their commission. Security is so relax that I can go in and out without someone checking in what I bring inside.",March 2015,NA

Were a bit tired when we came here around 1:15pm and we havent felt the hospitality that we expected Based on the reviews. We were just told to comeback and approach them again before 3pm...my husband and i were both travelers and this hotel is somehow different in a negative way. Before this trip, i already asked beforehand abt the tours so we could plan the budget before going to cebu.upon calling the hotel, i was transferred 5 times to different local nos. But no one answered my question.they just keep on telling me, that i have to call waterfront lahug to inquire.which is long distance...what if they must have a list of travel agencies with emails and contact nos. So it will be easy for.me to inquire and not advising me to call cebu in a long distance rate..

The upkeep of the hotel was excellent as well as the landscaping and pool area immaculate. Now in my opinion though its not a ""family"" hotel. The casino there brings in a certain element of people and you can see ""working girls"" all over and the hotel must know it...we could pick them out in a second so if that stuff does not bother you then this hotel is a winner. The breakfast buffet is excellent as well. Overall a great stay!",February 2015,NA

paulr147,Feb 2015,1.0 of 5 bubbles,With the visit,"I only found two things wrong with this hotel.  First, my choice, not into ally, of being there over Valentines Day weekend, which preceded the Chinese New Year Celebration a few days later.  And the second, the showers are built for short people.  I am only 5' 10' so not all that tall but the shower head was at my shoulder..  Not a deal breaker, as the rest of the hotel was excellent.  Can't say enough good things about it.  The exterior may look a bit rough but they are preparing to redo it as some scaffolding was going up.  I amenities were great,  6 restaurants, one bar, not counting the lobby bar where you can drink or order off the menu for food.  Coffee shop downstairs where you can get a great latte and pastry for breakfast, or take the buffet at UNO for about 800p, but extensive.  You can order your eggs to order, and everything you want is on the buffet.  The same for lunch.  I ate there on Friday and they had roast suckling pig which was excellent!. Italian restaurant also outstanding, service and food.  They offer a shuttle to the shopping malls but also taxi service is there and not expensive if you. Do not want to wait on the shuttle to take you or pick you up.  Massage salon, outdoor pools, one for adults and for kids only 3 ft deep with a slide, and a pool bar.  Gym facilities, and trainers if you want.  The only hotel I have ever seen that has a duty free shop in it, as well as a Victoria's Secrets shop.  Bring your lady and you will have a weekend you will not soon forget!

The breakfast that is provided with the room in the restaurant on the lobby level was good too, we had eaten there on a previous stay, a year earlier.

I arrive at the hotel slightly after 3pm but had to wait for the room. It took about over 1-hour to get my room, that only after asking when it's going to be ready. I had to ask three times which they should be the one who keeping me update or return back my first call. After a long wait and when I get the room, turns out to be a smelly room with string musty odor. Tried to call the reception to have the room freshen up but the phone was not working, This cause me to be more agitated. I hurry down to the reception to change room. They upgraded me to A premium Deluxe but there's nothing fancy about the room. The wood furniture squeaks and I got the view of forested area and construction. The room really needs refurbishment. I quickly head to Ayala Centre for quick lunch and later to find out the grand parade has ended. A real disappointing day.I would never stay at this hotel again. The grand lobby does not meet the service standards. I even write to the GM but till date no written reply and apologies. I only got a call from the duty manager to offer me a bottle of wine. I told him i don't drink wine. They obviously check thru my name before offering wine. In the end I asked for transfer to the airport, On departure, I was not met by the duty manager or the GM to offer a personal apology for my ordeal. I think, they don;t care what you going thru.

Graham C,Dec 2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Poor experience this time round,"We have stayed here a few times and we return here because we like the Waterfront - BUT - On this occasion we were given a nice King room that had a broken Air Con (Vital when its 28c at night).After 2 visits to the desk and being told that we need to wait for an hour for a man to fix the system I decided to go chat with the night manager to get a room move. Our initial complaint was at 6pm, we were waiting to go out for a dinner experience and it was 8:55pm by now. They eventually moved us to what they told us was an 'upgrade' to the 17th floor. I was told that housekeeping would be along to shove the 2 single beds together, as we had previously paid for a King bed. After we had got our bags sorted out I noticed that only one light was working in the room, there was a well damaged service hatch hanging off the wall bedside, and the TV was not working. We reported this and ended up getting a taxi for a Drive-Thru McDonalds because we were too late for dinner by now. On our return I actually had to go back downstairs after 10pm to kick off about the TV. The night manager then decided to send a technician, who took 40 minutes to replace the aerial wires to make it work. On going to bed we were then disturbed twice by some silly guy after 11:45pm who insisted on changing the light bulbs, only to discover that the bed moving had torn the electrics out of the wall. Very very bad stay for us overall. Our experience of seeing this disorganization was quite something of a shock. I think perhaps the hotel should stop spending massive amounts on the Great hall and shops and actually start upgrading what are becoming very tired old rooms. We spoke with the GM upon leaving and he offered us recompense of a free one night stay in a much better room. Dare we risk it ?",December 2014,NA

I noticed that the waiters (including their head or supervisor) DID NOT even attempt to delegate to waiters who WERE JUST STANDING AGAINST THE WALL CHATTING WITH ONE ANOTHER! The number of waiters was enough but they were under-utilized for some reason. My colleagues and I agreed that smaller hotels in other cities/provinces had better staff than this supposed 4-star hotel.

Rubbish!) rhat eevery meal time we ended up finishing our meal before our water/drink was served. Everytime we would request for a drink, the waiter would nod then not bring it to us at all! We had to request about 3 or 4 waiters before one of them would finally bring it. My colleague ordered coffee and she got it freezing cold after about 45 minutes (without an explanation or apology). I noticed that the waiters (including their head or supervisor) DID NOT even attempt to delegate to waiters who WERE JUST STANDING AGAINST THE WALL CHATTING WITH ONE ANOTHER! The number of waiters was enough but they were under-utilized for some reason. My colleagues and I agreed that smaller hotels in other cities/provinces had better staff than this supposed 4-star hotel. NOTE TO WATERFRONT HR: Please bother to train your staff.You are in the SERVICE INDUSTRY after all. And do not even use the large number of guests as an excuse! Pathetic.",August 2012,NA

The location is quite good right next to the Asiatown IT area, where there are lots of great food, drink, and entertainment options. The Ayala Mall is also just a 10 minute walk the other direction (although that's not such a pleasant stroll). They were doing renovations all over the hotel during our stay, and the first room we were put in was right next to a room being painted. When the paint fumes started giving us headaches, we requested a new room and were promptly moved to another one far from paint fumes. The room was very comfortable and the hotel had all the features  amenities one would expect of a hotel of this caliber. They have a great pool area, a beautiful garden, and a huge fitness room. The breakfast buffet at the UNO cafe was also excellent.There was only one small thing that did slightly lower my opinion of the hotel. When we requested a bottle opener, the staff member that showed up with one insisted upon opening our bottles himself and refused to leave the opener with us for the duration of our stay. Since we didn't want to constantly be calling for bottle opening service every time we wanted a bottle opened, we had to go out and buy our own bottle opener. Did they not trust us to leave the opener or return it when we checked out? Did the hotel have a bottle opener shortage?  Or maybe they simply wanted to encourage us to drink their canned mini-bar drinks that did not require an opener. Regardless of their reasons, I thought it quite odd. Whenever I've requested a bottle opener at other hotels, one has simply been loaned to me for the duration of my stay. Not the case with the Waterfront.

So many lovely things to try and there must have been about 25 types of cakes/desserts.Service at the front desk is very slow. Took forever to check in. They are very friendly though. Also took four times of asking to get a baby cot set up in our room. Like previous posts have mentioned, this hotel is aimed at business travellers and couples. Not very family friendly. Rooms arent very sound proof, you can hear whats going on in the room next door. Rooms aren't flash but they're not bad either. AWESOME gym, lovely pool and great casino.

Mark S,Aug 2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hotel, but stingy with their bottle openers","We really enjoyed our stay at the Waterfront. The location is quite good right next to the Asiatown IT area, where there are lots of great food, drink, and entertainment options. The Ayala Mall is also just a 10 minute walk the other direction (although that's not such a pleasant stroll). They were doing renovations all over the hotel during our stay, and the first room we were put in was right next to a room being painted. When the paint fumes started giving us headaches, we requested a new room and were promptly moved to another one far from paint fumes. The room was very comfortable and the hotel had all the features  amenities one would expect of a hotel of this caliber. They have a great pool area, a beautiful garden, and a huge fitness room. The breakfast buffet at the UNO cafe was also excellent.There was only one small thing that did slightly lower my opinion of the hotel. When we requested a bottle opener, the staff member that showed up with one insisted upon opening our bottles himself and refused to leave the opener with us for the duration of our stay. Since we didn't want to constantly be calling for bottle opening service every time we wanted a bottle opened, we had to go out and buy our own bottle opener. Did they not trust us to leave the opener or return it when we checked out? Did the hotel have a bottle opener shortage?  Or maybe they simply wanted to encourage us to drink their canned mini-bar drinks that did not require an opener. Regardless of their reasons, I thought it quite odd.
