virish30,Oct 2023,2.0 of 5 bubbles,"Read fine print and verify room package inclusions, they charge more when you're not checking",Made a direct reservation for a certain rate but was charged higher during check in. Staff at check in counter said there is extra charge for breakfast buffet despite having clarified with reservation officer that quoted rate is already room with breakfast. These people just wanted to get more from guests who are from abroad.,September 2023,Traveled with family
Gladys Mae E,Oct 2023,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Overnight stay,"Front Desk Associates are very accommodating, helpful and friendly, also the staffs in the Kai Restaurant, wide varieties of food selection and breakfast buffet is perfect. Concierge and FOA were very attentive and very helpful in assisting us during our arrival and departure. Our overnight stay is good however the downside of our stay is their aircon. We spent the whole night without it, to be honest, fan might be useful better than their aircon. We called for assistance but the Houskeeper who went to our room didn't even do anything, he just plainly said that's the situation and he cannot fixed it and just went out the room immediately. We didn't bother to request for a room transfer since it was already late and we are tired already. When we got up in the morning our luggage were so wet because of the leaking from the aircon, literally ice pieces is in our luggage that made our clothes so wet. I suggest that you should check up the status of your appliances regularly to avoid this inconvenience with the guests and probably train your housekeeper to have knowledge in addressing a solution and not just 'Mao ra jud na sir/ma'am', which is a very disappointing response.",October 2023,Traveled with family
Michael John,Sep 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY, IN THE HEART OF CEBU CITY","Great and comfortable and the price is reasonable. The location was great near Capitol, the breakfast buffet was awesome, and every day was a different menu. We stayed for 3 nights and the food was different every day, and the staff was very friendly.  My only concern was the room was not fully soundproof. In the night, you can clearly hear the noise outside especially when you are sleeping. Reasonable price for a place where you will feel special.",June 2023,Traveled with family

AveinSF,Nov 2022,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Pretty good place to stay.,"This hotel was pretty good. However, i would not pay full price for it though. As their publish rate was over $100 bucks. I got the room thru a free voucher. So i couldn't complain much. Check in was a breeze. Bellman took care of my bags. Welcome drink (its really nothing) also they put me on the 3rd floor. So no view.Room is size is huge. The bathroom was great. Its big and with a nice soak in tub. I definitely used that. Bed was California king size and a comfortable matress. Didn't get a chance to use their rooftop pool. I was gonna have drink up there around 5 but nobody was at the bar.  The wi-fi is pretty good. Even better in the lobby.The breakfast included was good. Alot if different variety. I would stay here again but not not for the full price.",April 2022,Traveled with family

The Gypsy Club,Mar 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great hotel!,"Located in the heart of Cebu City, this hotel really does offer a fantastic service. Check in was smooth and professional, the rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable, breakfast was abundant and very good too! We had a couple of tours booked that left very early in the morning, and the hotel organised early breakfast packages for us which were delivered to our room at the time we needed, exactly on time! Very good convenience service, as we had to do this twice. We also had a little problem with our airport transfer service (NOT booked through the hotel, I booked this separately myself) and still the reception staff really helped me out and solved the problem, which was very appreciated! The hotel also has a rooftop pool and dining area (also where the designated smoking area is) which is very nice. Food served by the pool area and also the service is fantastic! Customer Service really is the hotel's shining quality, and would mist certainly happily stay again and definitely recommend to others!",March 2020,NA

Cebu has enough in it for an intersting day and as a base for longer excusions. hotel provided a good breakfast box for a very early start for Oslob.Staff were really helpful and the food service excellent.

Agoda then told me they have never done that. Apparently the hotel just cancelled my room by themselves and took two nights full rates.

Erick,Dec 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,a very pleasant short stay,I stayed one night on late December 2017 and had a very good experience.The staff is fantastic. So helpful. Check in as well as check out was quick. Got a very quiet room on the 10th floor (had requested a quiet room ;-). The bed was so comfortable. The room very large. All very clean. The breakfast offers some variety. The food quality was excellent. Not only egg station but also pasta station ;-) ... I just wished they had fresh fruit juices. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. Definitely a great stay and should I come back to Cebu the Best Western will be on my list for sure.Btw the hotel is a mere 15 to 20 minutes easy walk to the Ayala mall where I got a very good and safe exchange rate at the Metro Supermarket in a small section of the store next to the grocery and the pharmacy (50 PHP to 1 USD while listed at 50.10  on Google that day).,December 2017,NA

The pool at the rooftop is okay, but could use a change of clearer water. Breakfast menu has enough variety. Downsides; shower water temperature a little difficult to maintain, credit card details required for airport pick-up reservation (don't bother, take the white taxi which costs just a little over 200 pesos from the airport). If internet is choppy, ask reception to give you the room number connection. Finally, a word of caution: hide your medicines which could be mistaken as viagra - my prescription capsule medicine disappeared from my room...",December 2017,NA

Great buffet breakfast. Choose pancake, bread, cakes, eggs any style, drinks fruit, and all fresh!! But what I appreciate the most is the kindness and service of every staff in this hotel.

Nengasca-Meyer,Nov 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Thumbs up,"Very clean and secured place to stay. Breakfast buffet included with the stay which is a plus. The food is also excellent. The rooms are spacious and the bathroom. Each room has its own hair dryer, a robe, slippers, safety box, refrigerator, and other basic things needed in a hotel. They also have transport if needed to go places. Swimming pool at the rooftop. Parking available in the basement. The hotel is located to a lot of restaurants and in the city proper.

beyann,Nov 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Anniversary trip,"Me and my partner came up to a plan where on every anniversary of us, we will be staying in a hotel, a one or more nights. So one of our best choices for our first anniversary is a staycation style, that's why we picked Lex Cebu. It was a good trip, we really liked our stay. For one night we were able to enjoy the hotel facilities, spending our quality time in the gym and swimming at the good looking infinity pool, enjoyed the buffet breakfast as well. Thanks to the reservations team for accommodating our request for considering to change our stay dates. Overall, it was a good choice to have Lex as part of our anniversary memories. Will surely come back here soon. Cheers!!",October 2017,NA

Very spacious with great king size bed, good aircon, great wifi, excellent bathroom  good TV. Very good service friendly staff with huge selection buffet breakfast. My only complaint is I love yogurt which for an international chain hotel should be a standard offering. The hotel had it available one morning out of 5 even though I asked twice if it could be available the next day. My only complaint really other than the normal 'wait a while' Filipino check out procedure (ALWAYS in the Phil's grab a staff member on your floor to come  do the room check for minibar etc just before vacating the room  insist they come down stairs with you for the checkout. It will save you 30+ minutes of otherwise frustrating boredom  every time!). Great value too by the way.

Got the room including breakfast on special with one of the popular online booking sites for $A75 ($US57) per night",February 2017,NA
Mnewey,Feb 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Close to each everything ,Nice hotel. Breakfast  buffet is very good. Rooms are very clean and spacious. Staff are very nice and polite. The lobby is a little out dated as the furniture is old and weathered. Easy to get around town but don't be in a rush as the traffic is the worst I have ever seen and I seen alot. All in all I would stay here again because of the room and the service.,February 2017,NA

maryvinne,Feb 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Luxury Rooms at affordable price,"The rooms are very New and very well done. The rooms offers a 5-star experience for the price of 3-star in the heart of Cebu. I also like the location because it's pretty much very near in any places in Cebu City. I think the hotel just need more advertisement to the taxi drivers because they are not aware of Best Western Brand they are more aware of Lex Hotel. Which I think is a way to improve the brand to the locals. The breakfast they offer is also very decent I so love the ""danggit"" that's the food you should not miss when you are in Cebu.",February 2017,NA
kennedyboy,Feb 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,top hotel in its price range,"we had a long weekend stay in the lex hotel Cebu and cannot fault one thing about this place. The rooms are very big and comfortable, super large bathroom and very very clean, i did read on here about noise from outside the hotel that made it hard for some people to sleep, and to be honest it was a concern for me before i stayed here as i cant be doing with noise outside when trying to sleep but the room that we had was very quiet and night and an excellent sleep was had every night we stayed here. we also ate in there restaurant on a couple of occasions and the food was really nice and not to expensive either so thats a bonus if you want a quiet night in, also the food at breakfast was very good for the philippines. Last but not least come the staff, they were top people in this hotel always had a smile for you whatever time of the day it was, these people are a credit to there workplace as we did not come across one member of staff that was nothing short of excellent. ignore the bad comments on here people as this hotel try""s very hard to give the guests maximum value for money.. Top place for a bed in Cebu City. Shall certainly return here",January 2017,NA
James B,Sep 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not a bad inter-city option,Lovely hotel with a decent location near all city center attractions. We took taxis everywhere but driving your own car wouldn't be a challenge for parking. Staff was friendly but weren't very accommodating to requests for changes in reservations.

Cymruchris,Aug 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well specified hotel, although location not so convenient","The hotel had a friendly welcome, and although stated in the t+c, I never like to have to pay additional deposits after fully paying for the room. I don't use a credit card, so they could only offer me a cash deposit option. The room was a delux with bath - which was a good size. The furnishings were good. I remember there being a mention of memory foam mattresses - when in fact, it's just a memory foam top attached to the regular mattress, which was ok, but it didn't lie quite flat. The pillows were like rocks, so I didn't find those comfortable. The bath was nice, and the hot water availability was good. The shower had two heads, a rainfall and a hand held. the rainfall could have done with some descaling, as it wasn't letting the water fall like rain fall, the little rubber nozzles were blocked up. The hand held section had a holder that wasn't able to tighten, which meant that the shower head remained at the bottom of the pole it was attached to, and couldn't be fixed at a higher level. This is ok if you're one of snow white's dwarves, but for most of us it's an inconvenience. So the shower was just ok. The mini bar wasn't very cold, but set to maximum. The air-con worked well. The swimming pool on the roof terrace was also a nice place for relaxation. Check-out was slow. I understand that the room has to be checked before departure - to make sure I haven't run off with the TV or the contents of the mini-bar - but it did take a long time.",June 2016,NA

Cymruchris,Aug 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Well specified hotel, although location not so convenient","The hotel had a friendly welcome, and although stated in the t+c, I never like to have to pay additional deposits after fully paying for the room. I don't use a credit card, so they could only offer me a cash deposit option. The room was a delux with bath - which was a good size. The furnishings were good. I remember there being a mention of memory foam mattresses - when in fact, it's just a memory foam top attached to the regular mattress, which was ok, but it didn't lie quite flat. The pillows were like rocks, so I didn't find those comfortable. The bath was nice, and the hot water availability was good. The shower had two heads, a rainfall and a hand held. the rainfall could have done with some descaling, as it wasn't letting the water fall like rain fall, the little rubber nozzles were blocked up. The hand held section had a holder that wasn't able to tighten, which meant that the shower head remained at the bottom of the pole it was attached to, and couldn't be fixed at a higher level. This is ok if you're one of snow white's dwarves, but for most of us it's an inconvenience. So the shower was just ok. The mini bar wasn't very cold, but set to maximum. The air-con worked well. The swimming pool on the roof terrace was also a nice place for relaxation. Check-out was slow. I understand that the room has to be checked before departure - to make sure I haven't run off with the TV or the contents of the mini-bar - but it did take a long time.",June 2016,NA
James B,Sep 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not a bad inter-city option,Lovely hotel with a decent location near all city center attractions. We took taxis everywhere but driving your own car wouldn't be a challenge for parking. Staff was friendly but weren't very accommodating to requests for changes in reservations. Roof top pool was cool and there's a great view of the city and mountains. The room was decent and mostly clean. The bathroom was too dimly lit for grooming.

sethbugs,Sep 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean, Friendly staff and sumptuous breakfast, Convenient location. All in one!",We stayed there for 3 days and 4 nights. Everyday we look forward for our sumptuous free breakfast on a buffet.. The staff are all friendly and are always ready to answer queries on how to go around Cebu. The hotel's location is very convenient since it is centrally located and near the tourist spots. And most of all the hotel is well maintained and very clean. They also have an outdoor pool and a bar at the rooftop where you can relax after a tiring day's stroll. Worth coming back to this hotel. :-),June 2016,NA

I did not have to worry about my accommodation as this place was clean, well equipped, central and with excellent service and friendly professional staff. I would happily stay there again. The traffic is noisy but ok for short city stay and they do provide ear plugs to supplement the double glazing! I particularly enjoyed a sneaky couple hours on the roof.

SammyhKhan,Sep 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Aims high but fails to deliver...,"The Lex is by no means a bad hotel, but its facilities and services are definitely lacking in a few domains. Beginning with the good aspects, the hotel is in a good location in ""uptown"" Cebu city; it is definitely a good base for exploring the city. The hotel and rooms contain all facilities one would expect from a 4-star hotel. Most importantly, the beds are super comfortable and services are delivered with enthusiasm and smiles! We avoided their extortionate laundry service fees though and probably saved a couple of thousand pesos by taking our laundry to one of the laundry services across the road though; we would recommend others to do the same as the place where we left our clothes seem to be providing a laundry service to other hotels in the area. Now for the not so good aspects. First, the breakfast buffet was lacking not only because their was a queue for a table most days, but also because most breakfast items, even things as basic as juice, toast, and butter, would run out out and not be topped-up as early as 45 minutes before the buffet closed. This happened a few mornings over the duration of our seven day stay. When we complained, we were told that they could bring us anything from the kitchen. However, we felt that this option was inconvenient as it would have entailed us writing a list of things required to enjoy a basic breakfast (such as juice, toast, and eggs) - we had paid for a breakfast buffet and wanted to enjoy a breakfast buffet! Second, the room service was haphazard. While the cleaning staff were really quick to tidy our room when we left it,  most of the days we had to ask reception for missing towels, shower gels, soaps etc. It was not a big deal, but annoying nevertheless. Similarly, the food from the restaurant was a bit hit and miss, ranging from super tasty burgers to inedible paprika chicken; overall guests are probably better off dining elsewhere whenever possible.Would I stay at the Lex again? Maybe because what we have learnt from four weeks of travelling in this amazing country is that the shortcomings we experienced at the Lex come part and parcel with the Philippines.",August 2015,NA

Joshua G,Jan 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,This is an excellent hotel in Cebu for the price.,I really enjoyed this hotel because it was the only hotel in the Phillipines that had excellent in room internet and a hot shower. In addition the breakfast buffet was way more than I imagined it would be. What dissapointed me the most is that I had to carry all my luggage to the room myself and no one bothered to show me how to run the aircon. This is the only hotel where I experienced this as well,January 2015,NA

This is not a problem unless you want to visit some of the resorts on Mactan Island which means you will have to deal with the traffic. Other than that, I have no complaints., The room have a comfortable bed, the internet was decent, bathroom had plenty of lighting. All in all, it was a decent place to stay. Also, there are plenty of food selection in the area. Jolly-bee, Buddy Burgers, McDonald's, 7-11, and a number of other restaurants.",April 2014,NA
Dean048,Apr 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Loved this Hotel!,"I found this hotel on tripadvisor and once again I was highly satisfied. My room was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable. Temperature control was perfect. Very clean and modern. Bathroom was beautiful. Only negative was that it was tricky to adjust the hot and cold water at times. The hotel staff were amazing. Great service everywhere. Front desk staff always very helpful, The breakfast buffet and the staff were great. Wi-FI worked great. Business center was good. Even the doorman were great and always there to catch me a taxi. The roof top infinity pool was superb and such a nice place to relax and enjoy the view. I score the hotel and it staff a perfect 10. Location is good too. 15 min walk to Aryana shopping mall or 5 minute taxi ride. 10 minute walk to Mango Square. I will be back in four months!",March 2014,NA
sedtravel,Mar 2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Good value, big rooms!","We stayed last week of October 2013 for 3 days, 2 nights.  We booked 1 deluxe room and 2 business class rooms.  All rooms are big.  Each room can actually fit in 2 king-sized beds.  We got the deluxe room for our 3 kids with 2 twin beds.  Even if our eldest is almost the size of one adult, they fit in comfortably when we put the beds together.  The deluxe room also has a bathtub with its own small TV.  I just did not like that they played music so loud (did not know if the loud speakers were in the hotel front driveway or at the roof deck) during our first night, and their glass panels/windows reverberated with the music.Aside from the music incident, I would still say the hotel gave good value with the clean, comfortable rooms and beds, courteous and helpful staff, and convenient location.",October 2013,NA
hadiabu,Mar 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Short stay,Best in terms of value for money. Hotel is located smack in the middle of the city so getting anywhere is pretty much straight forward.

spennipc,Mar 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,What a treat!,"The first time I have been absolutely satisfied with a hotel in the Philippines. Could not find any faults. Nice room, bathroom, swimming pool and bar (bit modern style, but OK). For evening meal just go across the road, quite tasty food and cheap. Prices in the hotel reasonable (can of beer php55 in the mini bar,not like php125 in the quest hotel).Will definitely use it again!",March 2014,NA
Immune01,Mar 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wonderful stay,"What a great hotel at a great rate in a fantastic central location!!!  We stayed at the Best Western for two nights and my only regret is not staying here longer.  The room was super clean, big and very comfortable.  The bathrooms were spotless and the amenities provided were generous. The beds are very comfortable as well. The roof top pool is small but a great place to relax and unwind!

jman0076,May 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great option and centrally located,"I used this hotel as a base from which to explore all over the Visayas, and came back 2-3 times over a 10-12 day period. It ended up feeling much like a home away from home for me, mainly thanks to the comfortable surroundings and friendly and approachable staff. For me the little quirks with some of the service added a quaint personal touch,and I wouldn't want this to change. A great place to stay by any standards.I never had trouble getting a great nights rest, and rarely even noticed the traffic noise. I suspect patrons who find this an issue are not really used to spending time in big Asian cities, if you think it may be an issue for you, then just ask for a room on one of the upper floors.",May 2014,NA

Comfortable beds but even on the top floor I could still hear all the traffic noise at night.
