Kirk,Feb 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Cebu's Best!,"Booking the Marco Polo Plaza Cebu every year for arrival or departure stop overs,its quality has not changed a bit.

David,Jan 2024,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great stay with a nice pool.,"Always a great stay at Marco Polo in Cebu, Philippines. The premier room we had was comfortable and roomy with two double beds and a nice armchair with ottoman to relax in. We had the Mountain view room, the sea view was slightly more expensive but really not worth the extra as who looks out the windows anyway. The pillows were soft and plentyful but I didn't like them as I'm used to a firm pillow but each to their own. One gripe was that the food provided by the hotel, whether in room or restaurant was quite expensive and they don't allow food to be bought in so apart from the ""free"" breakfast we ate out at Ayala Mall which involved catching a taxi each way and sometimes involved a wait  for a taxi until we decided to use the ""Grab"" cars. The breakfast was really great with a big selection of foods for local and Western tastes and as we were there for Christmas we indulged in their Christmas lunch buffet which was excellent, if expensive. We stayed for nine days and the staff were excellent and very helpful, especially the restaurant staff who had very busy days over Christmas and New Year. If you are looking for  great stay in a 5 star hotel then I would recommend Marco Polo if you don't mind paying that extra money.",December 2023,Traveled with family

Large on-site free car park, great feel-safe security, gym and spa both good, great value for money (much cheaper than other 5 star hotels in Cebu).Marco Polo is in an excellent location, just outside the City which remains very accessible, elevated, away from the pollution of the city and busy roads, clean fresh air.The well maintained building is some 38 years old, built in a Filipino style, with great charm and history, a change from the glitz of recently constructed hotels.Read more",December 2023,NA

From the moment we entered their parking space, it's so clean and spacious, overlooking the city, then up to their hotel lobby, the long elegant stairs, the centerpiece, you will immediately feel the wonderful relaxing ambience.

My expectation with Marco Polo is that they have superb customer service. When we arrived, no one assisted us to our rooms to carry our luggage. When in the room, I called their reception desk multiple times but no one answers. When we checked out, again, no one assisted after we asked for cab. Generally, the people are nice but they don't extend their services beyond that which I expect from a hotel at their caliber. However, the food is great.",December 2023,NA

Rob C,Nov 2023,1.0 of 5 bubbles,NONCHALANCE OF MARCO POLO,"Nov 19, 2023 will be an unforgettable date. On the same night I got our company’s annual top award, and the accident of a lifetime. Amidst all the highlights, one glaring thing overshadows everything - THE NONCHALANCE OF MARCO POLO HOTEL.It was before 12mn and we are about leave for home, when I saw that it was drizzling, so I asked my wife to wait for me at the drop off/pickup area just near the hotel’s entrance, while I get the car. The old structure of the hotel offers no convenience of a basement or roofed parking area. After a couple of steps on their pavement, I slipped and went down with my right arm first. This caused a fracture of my upper arm bone. I need to undergo surgery for a titanium plate to be attached.  Through the entire incident that happened within their property, I only got an sms from Marco Polo company nurse.",November 2023,NA

rbrown406,Oct 2023,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Not what we expected,"First impression walking in the door was good...went downhill from there. It was after 10 PM when we arrived and there were a number of people lined up to check in. The waiting for our turn took probably 20 minutes...too long. I booked this hotel because on the website it said ""3 pm check out""...so I asked when checking in if we could avail the advertised check out time and was told ""it is subject to availability, and we are fully booked so we cannot offer you that"". Stike two and we haven't reached the room. The room is really nothing special based on the price...not overly impressive and the fire extinguisher sitting on the floor doesn't help the visual appeal. We could not log in to the internet to notify family we had arrived. We also experienced problems with the cable TV being out some of the time. We were able to connect with the internet the next morning. There was only one spoon with the coffee cups. The water pressure in the shower was a little weak as well. The breakfast in the morning had a good variety of choices however the items that should be served hot were room temperature. The hotel is quite a way out from the airport and based on our experience it's not worth the effort. Better options much more impressive with similar price range. Not likely to return.",October 2023,NA

Even though no booking and fairly late we were greeted very warmly and seated. When told of our 7 year anniversary the staff noted this and later bought a complimentary cake for us. When I advised I can't eat anything with gluten the chef advised what dishes were gluten free and actually there was a lot of choice. The food was excellent but the real highlight was the exceptional service from the staff especially from Mark who looked after us professionaly and in a very friendly and helpful manner.

I have just one question: Does this hotel ever deliver less than excellent service every single day? I think not! From the doormen to the concierge to the front desk to the entire food service staff to the cleaning crew to the laundry staff, they are all top-drawer professionals who clearly meet the consistent standards of excellence established by the Marco Polo brand. I stayed on the top floor in the Executive Suite (2307) for a week with a gorgeous view of the city below and the sea in the distance. Talk about time to unwind…I didn’t have to lift a finger to do anything, all I had to do was ask. Whether you dine outside at sunset in the penthouse restaurant or have a 6 a.m. breakfast at a buffet without peer for food selection and service, you will always leave busog (full) and smiling with a need for tulog (sleep).

Breakfasts are incredible with a choice you just can't complete with so many beautiful tasty choices. Chefs are on hand to cook anything you desire. Rooms are spacious and kept very clean by the staff. The pool has to be the best, cleanest I have been in,.. lovely waterfall as well as a bubbling pool and a kids paddling pool. Plenty beds, chairs and cushioned loungers with parasols all around the perimeter.  Best part is the cooling breeze gently sweeping up the hillside and over the pool to make swimming and sunbathing a complete pleasure. Lifeguards are so attentive, handing out towels and bar staff serving free cold water or reasonably priced beers.

You can carry the food one by one etc. The staff were in shambles, as were I as they have been saying different stuff.

PLUS, I already asked their corkage guidelines before ordering out, that's why I was annoyed why on the lobby when the delivery came, the other staff said a different policy. It was INCONSISTENT. Then your Manager came to and rudely insisted on her side, that we were already given a discount, then she cut us off. The issue then got another solution.. that was neither said in our exchange. Again, food was great, staff was great.. It's just this one particular manager that made me hate my stay there due to her being rude. You may think I'm stingy but you can ask the housekeep that I tip generously, and he deserves it.

Please also note that apart from the Take Away, we also bought food and drinks from In-Room services but we've already been staying at the hotel for 3 days (booked 5 days) (we accommodated at least 8 rooms due to an event) of course we'd also love to add variety. PLUS, I already asked their corkage guidelines before ordering out, that's why I was annoyed why on the lobby when the delivery came, the other staff said a different policy. It was INCONSISTENT. Then your Manager came to and rudely insisted on her side, that we were already given a discount, then she cut us off. The issue then got another solution.. that was neither said in our exchange. Again, food was great, staff was great.. It's just this one particular manager that made me hate my stay there due to her being rude. You may think I'm stingy but you can ask the housekeep that I tip generously, and he deserves it. So this really isn't about me wanting to save money on corkage, it's inconsistency with your staff's knowledge and your managers rudeness.",November 2022,NA

As soon as you enter the grand lobby you will immediately feel the warmth of the Cebuanos. The amazing staff makes you feel so welcome and taken care of. The ambiance is classy and it gives you a certain feeling of pride to be walking it's halls but at the same time you'd feel at home and comfortable. The rooms are so clean and the beds comfortable. It's top class accommodation. Lighting in the rooms are warm, adding to the relaxing feels of like being at home embraced by family you love... And of course! The buffet breakfast at Cafe Marco is something to look forward to in the morning. The selection of food is wide and the food are delicious and carefully prepared. You can feel it in every dish they serve. The pool is also great. Perfect for a relaxing day and taking pictures too of course ;)  Needless to say, the whole family truly enjoyed our stay.

We have tried all the main hotels in Cebu City and Marco Polo has always been our preferred choice, the main reasons being; clean rooms, good staff, food quality, overall ambience and space, swimming pool and evening entertainments.This is our first trip here since the pandemic and I have to say that whilst still good, it's not what it was. I don't like the fixed plate arrangement at breakfast vs full buffet Monday to Friday, I presume (hope) it's due to current lower visitor numbers. And if I am really honest some of the staff clearly give preference to locals as opposed to 'visitors'. Evening entertainment now consists of some piano playing. I play myself so no issue, apart from the lack of ambience which the bands used to generate. The typhoon caused some damage to the outside of the building, I am surprised it's not yet been fixed and some of the rooms could do with a little updating.I still give it 4 stars as I would not say it's average, but I would say it's not quite to the standard it used to be.",March 2022,NA

The rooms are still good, the staff are still very pleasant, and the food and drink is of good quality (though lack of stock in bar of basic items and dried out meat on dinner buffet were issues on current stay). The main problem- and this hotel is not alone in this- is that the hotel has become preoccupied with accommodating children- seemingly in almost every way, all of the time. They are everywhere- in the pool all day (fair enough) but also late into the evening, running around the hotel lobby and into the lounge bar until nighttime, blocking up the main stairs taking group selfies. Maybe more understandable at Xmas/Easter but it is now off-season and it’s still prominent. So a relaxed atmosphere for adults not travelling with kids is hard to be found. Add to this smoking a cigar in the outdoor bar is no longer allowed and the old world luxury has been whittled away. The hotel may not care about all of this as the family market is lucrative, but certainly this approach will alienate many customers. Can’t keep everyone happy all the time, but some restrictions on kids in certain areas at certain times (eg in bars and pool after 7pm) would not be so difficult to implement and would make for a more balanced approach to accommodating a range of guests. A less militant approach to a smoking area could also easily be managed without aggravating non-smokers.",January 2020,NA

Kaz T,Dec 2019,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Such a shame that this wasn’t great...,"Let me start by saying that the friendly staff make this review of this hotel hard to write - they were all lovely. The Christmas decorations were magical and the pool area was really nice. The general views of the hotel were also lovely set up in the hills (no where near town but we didn’t mind as we liked the location and it was easy access to the port for our day tour to Bohol.) Unfortunately there are a few issues that really hindered our stay. Our check in was an hour later than standard check in time - not ideal after an early international flight as this really ate into our only free afternoon in Cebu, which was spent repeatedly being advised that our room would be available ‘soon.’. Our requested room on a high floor that was sold to us as ‘conveniently close to the Club Lounge’ actually meant directly under the nightly live band, the moving guest chairs of the lounge as they were scraped on the floor, the movements of the restaurant kitchen staff after they had closed, and constant noises late into the evening. We had to move rooms in the middle of our 2nd night of our stay (after an interrupted sleep from live music on the first night) as the band intended to pay until very late on a week night. Thankfully there was a room two floors down which was much better, but packing and moving all your items impromptu in the night isn’t great. I cannot imagine we would have been the only people to complain on our floor as it felt like the musicians were in your room. Our second room was actually much nicer and newer, and so was the floor in general. There was a family across the hall who would not have been able to sleep either. The range of food at the Club Lounge was also very very minimal, particular with regards to vegetarian options. The staff were eager to serve but the servings available were tiny and didn’t offer much variety. We ordered room service for both nights of our stay which is not our intention when we book a club room in Asia. We also had issues with wifi dropping in and out. It’s a real shame as I wanted to love this hotel but a few things I consider important in a hotel stay just weren’t up to scratch.",December 2019,NA

Noel is one of the lifeguards and he always made me feel welcome. I really enjoyed my stay here but the only negative thing I have to say about this hotel is that I thought the prices in the restaurants were a little over priced. I only ate at the hotel twice and it was for dinner  on both occassions. I had the buffet in the Cafe Marco restaurant and it was  excellent.

Cafe Marco’s breakfast buffet no doubt outclasses all resorts or hotels in Cebu shout out to the  manager running this resto and their food  beverage department as well as the culinary department that has always best represented this hotel of Marco Polo. Their pool facility is absolutely the best! Lifeguard though could be a little more energetic and friendlier but that didn’t take away in any way the fun and relaxing experience we had. The band last Friday night was outstanding almost everyone else in the lobby lounge had a great time thus let me give a pat on the back too for the wonderful service team there. We also had short trip to the penthouse lounge and this note would really be incomplete  without mention of the hospitality of the lady receptionist who looked after us while briefly there. Their Resident Manager Michaela always had time to say hello and check how things are, much appreciated. During check out it was impossible to book with Grab and the hotel on the last hour resolved my transport need.

Just teach your doormen  usherettes to be more attentive to arriving  departing guests. Because often, staff will just disappear from the lobby, pretend to be busy with some other things, or just look through you as you arrive or depart, and not open the door for you. Hospitality should start right at the door, not after check-in. And the guest should still feel appreciated even as we leave, so the door should also be opened for us.

I booked a mountain view and when I checked in they had a promo and gave me a seaview for a lower price with breakfast. Check in was fast and easy.

We had dinner there too and the food is also great but a little expensive.It is a little bit far from the malls compare to other hotels but there is not a long wait for a cab and they shuttle buses too to the mall.The rooms are a little bit dated  but I didn't mind much because I got a good price and it is not something that would ruin your stay.I will definitely stay at Marco polo the next time I get home.,July 2019,NA

If you want take advantage of the sauna after a long day of touring, you need to make an appointment for the Spa in order to use the sauna, and you guess it, at an extra.

The view was not special but I didn't need that. Sadly the traffic jams in Cebu City are legendary. If you really need to do business in the center you are best off finding a place there I suppose.

redroses123,Feb 2019,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Impeccable Hotel  Service,"Our group of 9 stayed at this Marco Polo during the Sinulog Festival. From our check in to our extended check out, the service was amazing. Unfortunately for me, I became sick and the housekeeping service and hotel nurse were so comforting and non-questioning when I needed their help. Our boat to Southern Leyte was delayed for 2 days, and the Marco Polo staff were able to keep our rooms so that we could stay until we were able to leave. The buffet breakfast was amazing. Many choices for breakfast (even had salads and main meals). I celebrated my 60th birthday, and the staff came out and sang to me and also gave me a cake which was decadent and I shared with our group of friends. Everytime we came in from our outside excursions, there were guards to check under our taxi with mirrors to make sure ""nothing"" was hidden underneath our vehicle and our purses were checked along with walking through a 'metal' detector. Very comforting to know, that we were all safe in the hotel. Never did I feel threatened. The outside pool is beautiful, warm and inviting. The restaurant/bar on the top floor was very nice and cozy for drinks. Amazing service was given to our group, out rooms were made up daily. And again, on a personal note, the housekeeping staff and nurses were quick and thorough for my recovery. The beds were double, so a bit small for Americans used to queen/king size beds. The linens were comfy. I asked for an extra pillow and more towels that were brought up quickly, along with more bottled water. There is a safe, robes, slippers in the closet. I did not use the sink water to brush my teeth, as I was advised to use bottled water. That would be my only caution. We faced the 'mountains' and the homes below and in the distance. You could hear the roosters and dogs all day/night long. The windows were not very sound proof on the 12th floor, but you get used to it. Nothing you can do about the neighborhood. This is their way of living, not yours, as a visitor to the Philippines. Do not let this discourage you from enjoying your adventure.",January 2019,NA

At check-in we were told that their there would be an extra charge for early check-in, and if we wanted a ocean view room which is a joke because the ocean is so far away its definitely not worth the money were were upsold on. The room was old and the sheets and towlea were dirty with stains. When we complained they mention that theybwere in the process of renovations, unfortunately that doesn't help us considering I'll never book this place again.

The deluxe rooms are spacious and bathrooms are clean except that it wonders me why the shower enclosures do not have doors? You'll certainly have wet floors after a shower and it becomes dangerously slippery when you wear their room slippers. The gym is ok but it would have been great if the gym attendants were actually on the floor assisting the guests with the machines and equipments instead of just staying behind the counter and chit chatting their time away. It would have been nice if the sauna room was free for hotel staying guests instead of paying 500pesos per head. By the way, forget about changing tv channels in the gym room. They won't allow you to change to a sport channel. They''ll stick to a news channel that's muted and can't understand anything. Cafe Marco serves good breakfast buffet. Blu Bar is very good.

As a Hotelier, I am a bit complicated when it comes to both and we had a great experience. Rooms Service is so good that we did not leave the room the first day, cozy retreat from a Typhoon skirting day. All we ate was fabulous and above the standad expected. And we ate a lot of things. My only criqtque would be some of the service in El Viento, Lobby Lounge and the loud HK staff on the floor, but it was nothing earth shaking. Some areas are in need of a face-lift but that has nothing to do with service, which is the most important aspect in a Hotel and it prevailed here. Bravo Brian and team.  We will for SURE be back.

The rooms can trick you into thinking that you are in a Shangri-la or a Marriott until you see the amenities (by Trussard), then you are sure to be in a Marco Polo.  Surely, beds are comfortable, a/c can be too cold, and tub/shower are refreshing. Breakfast spread is impressive and the oudoor pool as well as the fitness center can be alternatives to boredom. There is also complimentary shuttle to the Ayala shopping center; wi-fi, likewise. A slight fly in the ointment would be the fluffy bath towels that have a bit of a pungent smell. If not for this, a very satisfying stay.",July 2018,NA

garytaylor1000,Jul 2018,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Wants appearance of 5 star but service is 1 star.,"Hotel looks amazing outside and once you walk in.  Buffet breakfast was top shelf with an incredible variety of international choices.  Where they fall short is everywhere else.  One of my 3 rooms had a bathroom with broken toilet, clogged shower and sink faucet so loose its not even straight.  Front desk said it would be fixed but wasn't even looked into.  Wanted to stay an extra day (3 rooms) but was told by front desk help it would be better if I booked online.  Had to use 4 different third-party sites as they only had 1 room available for each.  One of the sites errored out during credit card as my CC company thought it was sketchy me using several overseas companies within minutes thousands of miles from home.  Still fighting for one reimbursement.  Also had an unpleasant experience in giftshop.  An item marked 3700 peso suddenly became 8700 when I tried to pay cash.  Said the 3 on price tag was an 8.  When it was purchased later by my wife (Filipino) and charged to the room it suddenly was 3700.  We tried to return it later but nobody on staff knew how to return it.   Big misunderstanding or travelers hustle I can't be sure but buyer beware. Good food at pool restaurant and bar and beautiful setting but little high priced.  Happy hour specials bogo was nice but drinks are hit or miss.  One might be really light on alcohol and next one overwhelming.Read more",June 2018,NA

I ordered their onion soup despite the price being higher than most places I've tried- Php 400. (some of the best onion soups I've tried are usually around Php 200) Nevertheless, I expected it to be super rich and worth the price being that it's a classy hotel. My 'soup' was served and I can hardly consider it a soup, it was more like onion water. The onion water wasn't even hot-lukewarm at best, it was served in the ugliest bowl. The onion were FAR from caramelized. It was still white and crisp. No flavor at all. Very unpleasant. There was no trace of cheese. The crouton was served separately. It was just an untoasted bread with a very light spread of butter. I was so disgusted that I stopped at 5 spoonfuls. I called the attention of one female employee wearing a blazer and asked her if the onions were even caramelized, an indirect gesture for her to take it back to the kitchen and ask the person who decided to serve it if that's really the kind of quality of food they serve. Instead, she just glanced at it and told me it was caramelized (it was clearly not). I wanted a refund for buying overpriced onion water but I just left it at that and decided never to eat there again and warned everyone i know to beware of Marco Polo's 400 pesos onion water.",March 2018,NA

A bunch of reasons we received from the Duty Manager who is just standing at recetion just to avoid us in getting the transaction pherhaps since this not under rooms division!  I know its weekend but as far as my understanding is concern being a hotelier for more than a decade, in the absence from banquet sales or coordinator, Duty Manager is always ready to assist any prospect business that might come in or partly future revenue of the hotel. Instead only that guy from concierge who who keep coming back and forth from the DM and to the center lobby we are just standing, extends apology for stupidiest unreasonable alibis coming from the Duty Manager. We've been treated badly and i just hope this will not be a reflected image of the hotel or only that Duty Manager who is incompetent, irresponsible and unprofessional cause he must approached us to inform the unavailability for having a showroom not just giving us a million reasons which is not consistent from the very start.For you to remember us we came at Mach 31 with a blue Kia Soul assisted by valet parker and i guess that is a black saturday.

I arrived late after midnight, I was given a room smelling cigarette smoke in a non-smoking room. I immediately informed them and I was quickly moved to another room. The in-house food service was great. The crumbs of the food I ate were not cleaned though. The check-out was quick as well. Everything else was neat. The next day, though, the face towels were not replaced. I received a phone call the night prior to my check-out asking how my stay was and if I needed any wake up calls for the next day. I told him to wake me up at 730am, unfortunately, the call never came. It’s a good thing I woke up for my flight. Other than those things, I will recommend this.",November 2017,NA

Paul M,Oct 2017,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Good hotel but beware of pre-authorisation charge,"This is a very nice hotel except for the way my credit card authorisation was handled. Instead of being a pre-authorisation of 5000 pesos, the hotel actually charged the amount to my credit card, which showed immediately on my online statement. The front desk and duty manager refused to accept the charge had been debited, despite being shown the evidence of my account online. No amount of persuasion, and some heated exchanges, could convince them otherwise as they attempted to then charge me for the room and dinner. I walked out, refusing to authorise the second additional and totally unwarranted charge. The management needs to ensure their check-in staff do not charge pre-authorisation (as does every other hotel in which I stay) but hold it until departure. Quite amazing that a good hotel can be so unprofessional in this regard.",October 2017,NA

I called to complain and I was told that they cannot bring the pitchers to the room, so the single glass is all you get.  Seriously?!!? I guess they have different rules here!

The hotel staff made you feel right at home from the moment you walked in. The staff at the restaurant were cheerful, friendly and exceptionally attentive.  There is no better way to start your day than with an awesome group like this. Of special note was ""Gladys"" who is the queen of customer service. Her bright smile greating me each morning, remembering exactly how I liked my coffee/cappuccino was a great way to start the day. Her warm friendly personality is exactly what every employer hopes for in a customer service professional. Gladys was by far the stand out professional at this hotel all week.

j0elnedf,Jun 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Charming Weekend away from Manila,"I recently stayed at the Marco Polo Cebu for a weekend while visiting a friend. Unlike the over priced five-star hotels in Manila (where I live), the Marco Polo provided fantastic value for money.  The staff were very helpful and friendly, and I enjoyed the great view and clean air. I was also pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food, which well exceeded my expectations. Due to its location in a provincial city, I assumed the food would be fair to good, but it was as good - indeed - better than many meals I've had in high-end restaurants and hotels in Manila, and much more reasonably priced.  The Thai food was quite excellent, and the Sunday brunch was fabulous.  I played golf on Saturday at Cebu's best course, which is about 10 minutes from the hotel. With it being so close and the hotel arranging transportation, it was an extremely convenient golf experience that I really enjoyed.  It's hard to come up with any serious criticism of this hotel.  While the property has been around for some time, it is well maintained and very clean, and where it really counts, the property is very much up to date.  For example, I'm a stickler for high quality beds, sheets, pillows etc., and I wasn't disappointed. Very comfortable, quiet sleeping experience.  All in all, I had a great weekend in Cebu, and will definitely stay at the Marco Polo again.",June 2017,NA

734Anna,Jan 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Not quite 5 Star,"We stayed here for 4 nights. The hotel location set on a hill affords great views of the city. The pool area is very nice as are the staff. The service is very hit and miss. The staff in the dining room are amazing!! So attentive and work hard. We spoke to the reception about visiting the Magellan cross and the basilica El Niño who then referred us to the concierge. We worked out with his help exactly where we were going to be dropped off. The hotel called us a taxi and as we are driving along the driveway of the hotel the taxi driver informs us that we cannot enter that area as it was the El Niño day and was closed to the the public. You would have thought that the concierge would know that as it's a national holiday (Sinalog) We ate at the pool bar the night we arrived and found the food to be average but overpriced for the standard of food. We also ate at Blu bar  Grill restaurant on the top floor with views of the city. My husband ordered the Angus sirloin steak at a very high price and this was very disappointing. We ordered drinks and then overheard another table asking for their second drink as it was happy hour. I don't understand why things like that are not conveyed to guests to make a choice whether they would like participate or not. We didn't!! We were sat (ok we did not have a reservation but they were not busy maybe 5 table inside and out) on the terrace at a table that had not been laid and after 10 mins someone came over and took our order and placed a napkin in front of each of us and nothing more until just before our meal came. We had a main meal and desert. Whilst waiting for our main course we were brought 2 bread rolls my husband ate one and I didn't. On the bill we were charged for it!! We didn't order it! The meals as with the deserts were well presented however personally I think this restaurant is Highly priced and over rated. I think the hotel is quite dated in parts, which is probably reflexed in the price.  The main foyer reception is very big and spacious. Our bathroom was very dated I found, All staff in all departments were very nice, helpful and friendly.Read more",January 2017,NA

First of all it doesn't look very luxurious (too much colour, too much unnecessary kitsch). Secondly, we had the buffet dinner and even tough the price was quite high (over 20€ excluding drinks) most of the dishes were cold and seemed to be not super fresh. This was very disappointing.

joaquin q,Jan 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wedding with Marco Polo,"Moving forward in life, We decided to get married. For people married I am sure you will agree planning a wedding is stressful. I visited so many hotels looking for the right place for our on the day wedding dress up. Marco Polo stood out because of one sales manager ""Ms. Tess Catipay"" . She took care of every need my wife and I had and if we needed her she was just a phone call away and she would answer every time without fail.  The excellence doesn't stop with her, from Front office (reception and bellman) who assisted all our visitor and stuff needed for the big day. When I requested for housekeeping to make up the room before I left for the church, I expected her to be shocked or pissed seeing the room in such a mess since it was being used by a lot of people, getting my wife ready for the wedding. To give everyone a bigger picture, My wife and her bridesmaids had hair and makeup done in the room.  The housekeeping staff just smile and said "" congratulations sir and have a memorable day. "" I can't remember her name but she mentioned, she was the reliever for the day on the 23rd floor. It's hard to express everything I felt during my stay with Marco Polo but all I know they help make my wedding day very stress free and memorable indeed.  Perfect in every way.

The first thing you'll notice when you enter the minimally furnished spacious lobby with its high ceiling and the grand staircase. Reception was fast and within minutes We were already going up our room. The hotel had a feel of late 80's to 90's design at least for me. I don't know when this hotel was built but in short my room reminded me of my childhood. Our room was clean and smelled good but I think it is part of a series of adjoining rooms since there were doors in the left and right wall of our rooms. The doors can use more insulation as we can here conversations from the next room very clearly. The shower head was working but the faucet connected to it cannot be switched off. We didn't report it until check out because we were going to use the tub too so I don't have an idea how efficient they are in answering this type of concerns. The staff were very nice and accommodating. The place was equipped with an adult and  a child pool, 3 restaurants, spa, salon (operated by Tony and Jacky), gym, and children's area (open only on weekends). Breakfast Buffet had a lot of choices (American, Filipino, Japanese, European). Internet is good and TV selections were ok. Its outside the business district and tourist spots but there are van, buses provided by the hotel to shuttle guests to business districts and the shopping centers. What I loved about the place is its clean, laid back, peaceful, and quiet. Its great for an RR and bonding time with my sister. I also loved that their pastries have just enough sugar and not too sweet and their freshly made juices. What I would like to see more is on changing food selection more because we were there for two days and the buffet didn't change that much. It was good that my sister and I planned on staying at two hotels for the duration of our stay in Cebu so we didn't get bored with the choices.Overall had fun and enjoyed my stay at the Marco Polo and will definitely comeback but I will definitely request a room with no adjoining room as my one big concern is the privacy in our room (if I can hear them, they can hear me, right?).",October 2016,NA

The breakfast is first class, lovely touches such as the fresh mango, individual juice servings and it's great to see small servings in chaffing dishes so that the food is constantly replenished and is as a result fresh and of great quality. The only down side was due to one individual tasked with organizing taxis for guests named I think  lianzel (?) who was very rude and dismissive in her approach and manner, perhaps she could spend a week job shadowing in the restaurant with Nigelle and her team to improve her appalling attitude.

For an awesome place deserving a 5-star designation, attention to the little details need to be addressed. My room was beautiful, but the bathroom needed better cleaning. There were water spots all over the shower floor indicating lack of attention to detail. The rubber mats used inside the shower were the ones you buy from cheap stores in the US, I believe made by rubber maid. Grout on the tiles show age that required update or thorough cleaning. The shower stall shows evidence that it is missing a sliding door. These little missed opportunities downgraded the hotels overall elegance.

I intended to use the room for wedding preparations where the bridal entourage would do the makeup, video, dress-up etc. I was upgraded to the Grand Executive Suite and I was really happy. The room was massive and could fit everyone (videographers/ makeup artists/ photographers/ entourage/ etc). Aside from that, the  service was excellent. Our groomsmen called for suit pressing at 2:00 am and someone was there within minutes. We also had champagne breakfast and it was excellent. The breakfast buffet at the lobby was good as well. My only complaint is the internet speed. Apart from that, I had a really good stay at the Marco Polo. Highly recommended.",July 2016,NA

ozcookie1,Jul 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Top Hotel with great view.  Excellent stay in Cebu!,We stayed in a Continental Club Room with a sea view.  There were three of us staying in the room but it was spacious enough.  The room was well appointed with an extensive range of toiletries.  A large fruit plate was waiting for us.  View over the harbour was impressive.  Check in was quick. It was worth paying extra for the club access as the breakfast and evening food and drinks were of a high standard.  The breakfasts particularly were impressive although they did not seem to have a great range of tea.  The food and service however was impeccable.  We ate a meal at the rooftop restaurant next to the lounge and this also impressed. It was a birthday dinner for my father so staff gave us a prime seat in the corner.   Shuttles to the city and shopping centre worked well and the car to the airport was also good at 500 pesos.  Overall an excellent hotel,June 2016,NA

In retrospect, I should have stayed here during my entire 7 day stay in Cebu.  My hotel room was immaculate (Room 1814).  Nice overlooking view over the cityscape and mountains.  Definitely, try to get a room as high up as you can.  Comfortable bed with 4 pillows on each bed.  Soft sheets.  Great, updated bathroom with rainhead and handheld sprayer.  Good water pressure.  We came in late at around 8 pm tired from our other hotel in another part of Cebu so we ordered dinner from room service which was prompt -- less than 30 minutes.  Our stay/rate came with free buffet breakfast and there was a wide array of choices from American-style breakfast (eggs, pancakes, waffles, pastries, sausage) to Asian-style breakfast.  Wifi was fast and reliable (had no problems with strength or being disconnected).",April 2016,NA

The rooms are very well appointed, the breakfast buffet well stocked and tasty, the service is impeccable. If I had to say something wasn't perfect, then it would be the location. Set up on the hill a little way out of town there is no walking to a nearby restaurant, it's taxis all the way or eat at the hotel, whose food is more than passable. There's a nice pool, a gym, and a lovely rooftop terrace for those sundowners. All in all it's not a bad place to stay, just lacking any local flair.",June 2015,NA

First the main pool looks good with its waterfall and Imerged sun-chairs. It is very clean too. There is also a shallow pool that kids love. Don't get me wrong here, there are not many kids playing or yelling. Ambiance is cozy and comfy because not crowded. Dining experience around the pool is always great. Romantic one would say. And they serve a large choice of dishes. Breakfast is huge too. So if you are into shopping or luxury rooms, it may not be for you. There is another international hotel connected to Ayala Shopping Mall that serves this purpose.

I usually find carpeted rooms in Cebu to smell moldy. The carpet was old and the furniture was dated but everything was clean and the complimentary fruit basket and flowers were a nice touch. We ate at the Blue Bar on the roof and the food was excellent. However i treated 3 friends and their ladies so there was a group of 8 of us. The bill was over $350. For the Philippines that is outrageous. We had a light lunch that day in the buffet and it was great but expensive as well. The next morning we had breakfast in the same buffet hall and it was fantastic, but they tried to charge us for it and i had to request it be removed from the bill.

The pool felt cold, when we used it.  Some problems with the wifi, which, for 2015, shouldn't happen.  Staff attempted to help with the wifi, as my girlfriend needed to do work over the internet.  For my leisure use, it seemed to work well enough.  Bathroom amenities were good and robes were provided.  Our room had a minibar, with decent rates, and an in room safe.

jennifer_thomson,Dec 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great for a feast, but rooms are not 5*","After a long day of traveling to get to Cebu, we were excited about our short stay in the city. Our drive to the hotel looked promising with lots of local food stalls and shopping malls, but then we started up a steep incline and we moved in to the expensive car dealerships and then not a lot. The hotel is located high up on a hill and is remote, which isn't a problem if you have a car or are happy to use public transport. The hotel obviously recognise this as they offer a free shuttle bus to the local shopping mall, every hour, but this finishes at 18.00 from the hotel and the last pick-up from the mall is at 19.00. Great for day time shopping, but not to venture out for dinner. Supposedly this is the only 5* hotel in Cebu, but I don't have proof to say either way. However, my experience was this is more 4*. I could be accused of being picky, but it was the little things that made me down grade the rating of this hotel. Upon check-in we were told a room with a double bed wasn't available, but only two singles. We couldn't believe the hotel was at maximum capacity, so challenged this. The lady on reception wasn't the most helpful, but after some pushing she was able to find a room with a double and a queen bed in it. The lobby was being decorated with a Christmas tree and lights, so looked very pretty, but the lift and bedroom floors looked dated. Our bedroom had curtains of different lengths, which made it look like one half of the pair had come from somewhere else and it just had a look of needing some love. We ate in the main lobby reception at dinner and had the buffet. There was a huge selection on offer and was great value at the price of approximately £20 per person. It was very busy and looked like a number of locals were there to enjoy their Saturday night too. We took this as a good sign of the quality and service we received. Breakfast, which was included in our rate, was also another great feast and also appeared to be utilised by the residents too. I would recommend this hotel as a good pit-stop to re-fuel, but would caution visitors about its location.",November 2015,NA

Ando11,Nov 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Below expectations,"The only 5 star hotel in Cebu …? It is about an hour from the airport, depending on traffic. Based at the top of a hill, there is not much in the surrounding area to go and do on foot, so it is a taxi ride or shuttle service to some of the shopping centres or market districts. First impressions were good, but the room was a little past its best. The shower had intermittent hot and cold water, there were wires showing on the light in the shower and the windows let in lots of the noise from the entertainment below (room 1602).On the other hand, the food was great. We went for the dinner buffet at about £21 per head, and the offering was plentiful and we kept finding new treats each time we returned to the food counters. It seems that the hotel is a popular location with locals looking to eat till their hearts content. This was doubly true for breakfast.  Visit this hotel hungry and you will leave feeling somewhat ‘stuffed’.The staff were really helpful and happy as we have found in the whole of the Philippines. We did have a 15-minute check in as they struggled to find us a double bed.Read more",November 2015,NA

We were asked to wait and we seated in sofa near the reception area. We  waited for almost an hour thinking that maybe they are waiting for other passengers. We could see the staffs from wherewe were seated including the staff who assisted us to list our names down. More than an hour passed and hunger became a little bit unbearable and we approached them. To our surprise, they said the shuttle already left a couple of minutes ago. We were really, really pissed off by then. What's the point of keeping a list if they won't even bother calling out names or at least announce that the shuttle was about to leave? We were then approached by their reception manager and talked to us about the situation. I was willing to let it pass since I don't want to ruin our vacation. But it wasn't okay for my fiance. We were greatly inconvenienced by that event. We took a cab instead. Upon checking out, the reception manager talked to us again. But until then she didn't apologized. She said that they held a meeting and that incident was discussed for improvement. She offered to pay for the cab fare which for us is a bit insulting. It wasn't about the money but the inconvenience it brought us. She offered us a complimentary instead. We really hope their staffs will be further trained because the hotel should live up to their claim of being the first five star hotel in Cebu.",July 2015,NA

From the dinghy lobby to the slow elevators to the cheap executive chair inside my room, there was too much of a letdown.  Even the Executive lounge in the top floor where snacks and breakfast were offered was comparable to an executive airline lounge but this you have to pay a hefty sum.

Very well isolated (there was very heavy rain while we were there and I only noticed it the day after), rooms with all modern comfort, (although my wife missed her 'bidet'), including free wifi and open air parking.  The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed a free and pleasant evening in the lobby lounge bar with mini concerts from a guitar playing singer, followed  and a female piano player.  On the highest floor (use the outside glass elevator to go there) there's an open air bar-restaurant with a romantic view over Cebu.  Breakfast is really nice and there's a lot of choice in Filipino, Japanese, Korean and even international dishes.  Nice experience indeed.

Bell boys were amazing, friendly and helpful though! There was only 2 sachets of complimentary coffee in our hotel room (no tea bags) which was a bit disappointing cos it's a 5 star hotel, but I suppose we could ask if we wanted to (we didn't try).

The property is beautiful. I'm told it's one of the older hotels in Cebu, but there's no way to tell that from looking at it, it is beautifully maintained. My room was large, 32 sqm, and very comfortable and beautiful. This hotel is great for business or leisure. One of the nice surprises is that the coffee mugs they give you are large - large enough to hold my entire morning shake (I always bring my portable blender). My only complaints are very minor - no outlet near the bed and a bit difficult to fit my food in the fridge with all the minibar items I don't need. I had difficulty at first figuring out how to get the shower to work. A call to the desk and an engineer was there to demonstrate within about 3 minutes. The shower/tub was great - good water pressure and heat, the tub filled very quickly with hot water (unlike some hotels in this country with either no tub or a tub that barely works). The restaurant on the top floor is gorgeous, and I had one of the best steaks of my life. I had the buffet one night - even with my very restricted diet there was a lot I could eat.

I've had equally enjoyable stays in other hotels but never felt the compulsion to write a review. But this time, I have to.  The staff are professional, courteous and trustworthy.  Not on purpose, but because I had a lot of things to do, I left my laptop and other valuables in my room in plain sight a number of times, and they are still there when I return.  Housekeeping has come and gone, and done a neat job at that, and my things are all accounted for.  You really cannot say the same is true for other hotels out there.  I left my laptop charger in the conference room, they kept it as 'lost and found', and I was able to claim it the next day. What can I say, I must admit I was not too careful with my things during my stay there, due to all the other things on my mind.  But the hotel staff took care of my things for me.

I really like the breakfast buffet here and think it's the best I've had in Cebu (although some complain it's been cut back lately).

When we figured it out and went ti our room, we met with the serviceman and he explained how some things work in the room and he was really pleasant, he spoke good english and left us with a smile. He said his name was Luis. The rooms were nice. It's just that there's a stinky smell in the restroom. I think that the housekeeping staff did not clean the toilet well. The  night of July 18th, ai visited the Blue Bar and Grill. It was so beautiful and you just wanna stay. We didn't stay for long hours in the hotel since we were always outside.

The breakfast buffet is very good experience, and good value.  The pool is good quality, but a tip is to RESERVE your space/recliners in order to get a good shaded location. To get a decent swim you should go very early morning, or later in the evening to avoid the crowds  kids (or go swimming midday like I did with some good sunscreen and sun protective gear, because the pool will be all to yourself as most Asians/Philippinos will avoid the direct midday sun at all cost.... ;) ).  We were given a room on 15th floor on the southern end facing the hills, and directly overlooking a rather  well worn-down squatter housing area. Our room was almost directly above the main road passing the side of the hotel. Normally the room location would have been fine, but because the main road has a very steep incline, most of the noise from high revving motorcycles travelling at speed uphill can be disturbing, especially after midnight and into the early hours of morning (even with A/C on full and windows  curtains closed.  The room was a good, medium size and bed linen and fittings were high quality. The mini bar fridge was disappointing with no ice making facility and fairly poor chill capability. MUST have Ice for drinks. We had an enjoyable time here, and would go and stay again. More of a 4 star than 5 star hotel, but good overall quality for Filipino standards.",July 2015,NA

Staff were efficient because check in did not take that long. The lobby area was so spacious and classy. The rooms were comfortable with comfortable beds and pillow. (Our room had one double bed and one single bed)  Bathroom amenities were good quality since this is a 5 star hotel. The hotel has a service van which can take guests to town like the SM Cebu and Ayala Mall. We also loved the coffee/tea area with entertainment (piano and live music) at night, since its relaxing to listen to the music.

Mai A,Jul 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Beware of The Pool Police,"I had a good experience staying here before so I decided to book this hotel last minute just so the kids and their friends can have a pool to swim in that was close to the city. I have always loved Marco Polo's location even before when it was still Cebu Plaza hotel,  I always thought of it as a very classy and sophisticated place up until this most recent stay. The room rate was very reasonable at $50/ night, I booked a regular 2 bed room, and they gave me a ""lovely"" mountain view overlooking the ghetto squatters area, that happened also before, but I didn't mind it so much since I don't look outside my window the whole time and I keep my blinds closed. The front desk agent and her manager were very nice and pleasant, they even gave my 2 year old a little kiddie goody bag and had even instructed housekeeping to join the beds together. The stay would have been perfect, and I would have rated this hotel 4 stars if not for the ""Pool Police"" aka the Life Guards. Since it was already late when we checked in, it was about 5 pm already, we had little pool time left for that day, using the pool was in fact the whole purpose of this trip anyways. We were advised by the Front Desk, that the pool would close at 10 pm, when we finally got there the pool was roped off and it was only like 6:30 pm, he informed us that he could not let anybody in the pool because of a Lightning Storm... uhm ya... I have not heard of that one too, it was not even raining that time, and it was just some flashes of light in the sky... I guess they were afraid we would get electrocuted in the pool while swimming??? I googled it and it said that getting electrocuted by a lightning storm while swimming in water was highly unlikely! I wonder where they got that made up policy. Anyhows, we waited a good 30 minutes before they let us use the pool, I was tempted to go back up to the room, but we were already all changed and ready to take a short dip so we waited it out. When we were able to use it, he started harassing us about signing the log in sheet, how many kids, how may adults, that my 2 year old can only use the kiddie pool, I had to run up and get a life vest, and all this was said with no finesse whatsoever. There were only 2 adults in my party and 4 kids, and he also shorted us on the pool towels. I saw him doing the same to other guests that arrived as well, not even a hi hello welcome to Marco Polo, but he instead is hounding them to sign the login sheet and how many in their room etc. The next morning, we used the pool again, it was a different lifeguard this time, so I thought it would be different, but to my dismay same thing, it's like they all came from the same pool police training. How many in my party, how many adults and children, arguing that I had to pay extra because I had 4 kids with me, shorted me on pool towels again, hounding me to sign the login sheet. All this with not even a good morning, hi, hello, how's your stay? Life Guards should be there to keep an eye on the swimmers and to save lives, not to annoy the crap out of guests! We ordered some food from the pool menu, the food was ok, a bit pricey and small in portions, but at least that was good. The rooms were just ok, maybe needs a little bit of updating. Only the front desk showed good customer service, the servers, security guard by the pool and the life guard really need improvement on their customer service skills. Marco Polo used to be one of my favorite places to stay, this experience has got me really turned off, I hope they do something about that.",June 2015,NA

When we first arrived,  the receptionist assisting us with our room check in offered to bring our luggages in our assigned room while we dine in the lobby resto. For me that's an excellect customer service. Offering something that is not being asked for. The hotel's breakfast buffet spread was also good. They have I think a mix of all types of cuisine and also good selection for picky eaters like my kids. We have also tried the other restaurants in the hotel like the El Viento and the Lobby Lounge, both offering good selection of food. I would recommend this hotel for family vacation. They have pool for kids, they have playroom, and medical clinic. I was surprised that the medical clinic really has supplies of over the counter medicine when we asked for paracetamol for my toddler who had a slight fever after swimming (due to windy and cold weather when we where there, i guess). Though the hotel is not in city center, they have a free hotel shuttle to help you get around the city. What we didn't like about the hotel is that some hotel staff talks to us using their native language. Unfortunately, we do not speak and understand Cebuano and so we had to tell them ""Filipino or Tagalog please"". It is best that all hotel staff be reminded to use Filipino or English only when speaking with all hotel guests except ofcourse when the guest initiated to speak in Cebuano.",July 2015,NA

All points of interest are within easy reach with shopping malls only a 5-15 minute drive away. The room that I selected had a perfect view of the mountains and I suspect that any room in this hotel will have a great view due to its hillside location. The room itself had everything I needed for a relaxed stay, no complaints at all. This hotel has a beautiful pool and other amenities but unfortunately I didn't get a chance to use them due to other commitments. The onsite restaurant served a large buffet breakfast with many Philippine dishes, cost included with my room purchase. I only ate one dinner meal at this restaurant on my 3 day stay here and the food was delicious but my only issue is that they have several taxes that are added to the final bill which gives you a nice jolt. I didn't worry about that since there are so many low cost places to eat in Cebu.

Not acceptable... and service charged and VAT taxed to death on everything you order.

Location is a bit far from the City Center, but they have a free shuttle service. Since we were not able to avail the shuttle service, we took the taxi to Ayala mall and it cost us Php 100.00.

Francesca V,May 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A lovely hotel that is a bit out of the way!,"I've always been one to favor the Marco Polo hotels when traveling. Marco Polo Cebu is quite lovely, sitting on a hillside you are sure to have a lovely view of the city. Their breakfast buffet is something I thoroughly enjoy though it may not be as big a spread as others there are some key things that I liked -- say... truffle mustard for one! YUM! The beds are an okay size which had a lovely view. It is a however secluded and a bit out of the way if you are looking to be a stone's throw away from the malls and such. It gets a bit traffic in the road heading up to this hotel as well -- so you have been warned. But it is a great place to escape and is recommended for that. Also, Blu Bar is a fun place to hang out in -- given the lovely view -- albeit it being a bit pricey. Tip: this place has a dress code and is closed on Monday's!",September 2014,NA
Graham A,May 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,It should have been lovely...,"My girlfriend had been asking to eat at the Blu Bar which is a restaurant at the top of the Marco Polo so I booked us in there for a night. The lobby of the hotel is fantastic as you would expect from a five star hotel and the room was top notch too. Once we got to the right one that is. We arrived around 11.30am so okay far too early for normal check in but worth a try. We were told a twin room was ready but we had asked for a double so agreed to wait. After over an hour in the (very nice) coffee shop we gave up and said we'd be back later, and in fact didn't come back until the evening. We were then shown up to...you've guessed it...a twin room. Another two calls and a short wait before we were shown to a double. We dressed up excitedly ready for our Blu Bar experience, only to find it closed on Mondays...oh well. Not really the hotel's fault  I suppose but disappointingly none the less. We slouched off; cue a one hour wait to be served in the alfresco restaurant downstairs, next to the swimming pool. My girlfriend had to do some work online so just as the food arrived we asked for it to be re-delivered to our room instead. We quickly took a lift up expecting the food to arrive soon after but it didn't, and took a phone call to chase it up. Forty minutes later two meals arrived but with only one set of cutlery. How long should you wait for a set of cutlery in a five star hotel? About 45 minutes it would seem in the Marco Polo by which time the food was cold. Anyway, even I can see that I just had a run of bad luck that night and I'm sure you'll be fine. Fingers crossed. Oh, it is a bit off the beaten track, in the foothills above the city, so for example there is no regular supply of taxis sitting outside. Expect a wait at peak time.",April 2015,NA

Glenn,May 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Close but yet far from City centre,"Marco Polo have a perfect location If you want to stay close to the city centre but yet away from all the noise and traffic. Ive been staying here with both family and friends in different settings. Especially a great hotel If you have children that likes to run around. I remember this hotel very well from I was a child myself(15-20years ago). Name then was Cebu plaza. Seems like Marco Polo deliver every time. It's like nothing have changed the past years except the facade and interior have been well maintained. When you enter there are guards smiling and opening your door. Smiles that could infect you no matter how tired you are. Entrance hall quite large and the high roof gives you the feeling of standing In the middle of a huge hall. Surroundings feels comfortable. Their restaurant Is famous all around Cebu city. Both locals and expats living In Cebu comes for their ""famous"" lunch buffet. Pool area In landly surroundings. Rooms are comfy and clean. I prefer the club continental rooms. It's an old hotel so don't expect new standard on rooms. Maintenance genereally In Philippines Is tragically. But In Marco Polo they seem to have a good maintenance. That I can like since too much hotels, restaurants, buildings In Philippines dies slowly without getting enough maintenance. So thumbs up Marco Polo. I always come back. Hope people will enjoy It same way as I did.",May 2015,NA

The service was ok, food was good but not great, they've got a beautiful pool, nice ambiance. I tried their spa and got a treatment...it was excellent! First issue, I'm Filipina  my husband is Italian. We're a young couple. The staff of Marco Polo treated my husband  my in-laws nicely. But me? it's as if I didn't exist. What they didn't know was, I paid for everything as it was a treat for my in-laws. Second issue, the front desk officers look at me and whisper things in Visayan to each other. That is very rude! The staff of Marco Polo should know that not all Filipinas with a Foreigner only want their money or that we are all picked up from a club or something. Third issue, inconsistency. It's either hit or miss. The only reason I'll only stay here for the 6th time is their room. Hotel is old but it's still well-kept, immaculately clean. The only staff I like are the security.

The room is nice and comfortable. Their wifi connection is really good. The food though is a bit of a hit or miss and portions are really big. I ordered porkchops with mash potatoes once and ended up sharing it because I couldn't finish the whole thing. (By the way, the star on that dish was the mash potatoes and not the porkchop which was dry and underseasoned. The mash on the otherhand was phenomenal.. melted like butter in our mouths! )The staff here were very accommodating. One day I tried to test how they would react if we brought back items from the well known dried fish market of Cebu. When we got back to the hotel we had a box filled with different yummy products that was stinky as hell... not to mention even the stink clung to our clothes and body! The receptionist just smiled at us and very nicely said that we couldn't bring the box in the room but they would keep it in storage up until the time we check out.

Tere1558,Apr 2015,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Big disappointment,"Its been more than a week and still no concrete result on the investigation as to our lost Beats Pill inside our room while we are having our dinner in their hotel lobby.  One of their staff enter our room to deliver a small basket containing easter egg candy.  According to the duty manager it is a protocol for the housekeeping to enter the room even without the guest inside.  There is no problem with that because before we leave on Thursday to visit some relatives we left them but have our luggage secured not when we are left on guard.  I reported it when we notice that it is missing that is when we were about to check out and they assure me that they will investigate.  Despite the fact that I lost  something valuable I still  leave a small amount for the housekeeping but when I came back to get the other key which I left in the room I noticed that the envelope containing a small amount intended for the housekeeping  is already missing.  This will only prove that they have staff that could not be trusted or ""malikot ang kamay"".  This is the first time that I lost something in a hotel considering that it is a five star hotel.

In Cebu, Marco Polo is well known for having one of the best buffets in the city (perfect for any and all occasions) and truly, in the past it was. But on my last visit, I was sorely disappointed. My husband and I didn't enjoy anything, though everything looks good, it stops there. The pasta sauce was tasteless. The meat at the carving station was tasteless as well. Hubby can usually eat around 2-3 plates of meat but he didn't even finish one! The dessert selection looked heavenly, but the cakes were all dry.

MayomeBrown,Aug 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Our Top Hills Mansion,"There in the top hills of Cebu in veterans drive,situated the elegant and luxurious Marco Polo Plaza, a friendly and romantically elegant hotel in Cebu..me and my Dong stayed there for some reasons, first is we have flight to catch the next day, though it's not as close as it is to the airport still it's appropriate for people who have flights the next day, it's because of the easy access and taxi or private cars or even the van of the hotel can take you to the airport in no time.second we stayed there for we want to have a luxurious relaxed and romantic city view scenery and indeed it is..from our room at night we can see stars twinkling below us...I never seen a stars below us,not until we stayed in Marco Polo,the city view gives you the inner peace and beauty you probably never seen before..Marco Polo sat above the city with it's elegant aura... the room we stayed is exceptionally Well polished and cleaned and it smells soo good...u can really feel you're given the best room among the best..though it's quite pricey yet when u enter the hotel to their room you will not think of the amount you paid anymore it's because of the quality service they've given you(though it's not me paying it ,its my husband-but I'm Sure he also feels that way..😉)....but I have one issue tho..during check in the receptionist is taking so long to let us check in will in fact we've already given her the confirmation code...but over all it's sumptuously a perfectly perfect stay for us..and we'll be checking in again if we'll be in Cebu..😊",June 2014,NA

bap2_s,Aug 2014,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Underwhelmed,"Last time I stayed in this hotel it was still named the Cebu Plaza Hotel. Knowing that it has become the Marco Polo Hotel I was very excited to stay there since we were very much impressed during our stays in their Davao and Hong Kong hotels. Whenever we are in Cebu, we always stay at the Marriott hotel and welcome this change and looked forward to our stay there considering the room I booked is on their Premier Suites. Much too our disappointment the room was the same size as that of our usual rooms at the Marriott but the bathrooms were only half the size. So if you're a bit claustrophobic I suggest you either book a bigger room or another hotel. Given that we also indicated a non-smoking room a funky odor still emanated every time we entered our room. We could also hardly get any rest at night as the noise coming from the upper floors can be clearly heard in our room. Unlike the Marriott, their Wi-fi is only limited to 2 gadgets. The worst part of our stay was that the room cost almost twice as what I pay for at the Marriott. The only saving grace for me was their staff who were all very courteous, always smiling and very eager to help. My review for the Marriott is also very less than stellar but I would rather go back there than stay at the Marco Polo Cebu again.",August 2014,NA

Gold medal for reception: no hello, long waiting, long processing, unjustified charges that were removed without an apology. Worst was they tried to rip us of when we had to extend for an extra night; they said that hotel was fully booked on that night and that room price was no longer php 4300 but php 7400. I immediately checked on my favorite online booking site and guess what... same room still available for 4300 When I told the lady about it she said they were about to call to change the price. Believe what you want... Shame on supposedly swiss management. One more point to note is that the room door was not sound proof at all so we heard other guests going back and forth the whole night (our room was just next to the elevator). If you want great staff and no hassles go to the Radisson Blu. It's however not nicely located.",August 2014,NA

At the Continental lounge you can enjoy a la carte meals at breakfast then a small buffet is set up for lunch, merienda and early evening cocktails.  There is also an open bar.  As for the room it was spacious with all the amenities and creature comforts one might expect from a 5-star establishment.  What is great about this hotel are the little things that make one's stay special, like cheese and nuts plate when I arrived or the night snacks they tempt you with like cookies and ensaymada.

I would really thank that front desk officer who handled our check-in registration for making sure that our king bed preference is met. Yay! Me and my boyfriend were so thankful we didn't need to sleep in different beds because we were informed prior that there might be a shortage of king beds upon check in. Another thing was that upon checking out, we were already driving away from the hotel when I noticed I don't have my phone in any of my bags so I realized I must have left it inside the room. So we hurriedly went back to the hotel. I panicked because we knew right after we got out of the room that housekeeping was going to come in and clean. So we just hoped that Marco Polo is as dependable and reputable as it was advertised and that employees are trustworthy too. Good thing there wasn't any trouble from the registration about getting back to our room and checking if my phone was still there. And good thing too that the housekeeping guy knew that a phone was left and informed us that it was on the table. And yes, it wasn't touched. Just where we left it.

You will find the resto and the pool at the ground level as well as their gift shop.  The rooms are well-maintained and with well replenished toiletries.

So I was not able to sleep in after arriving at the hotel at 3am.  All they would say was I am sorry.  They should post on their website if they are having construction so then you can decide if you would like to hear pounding each morning bright and early.  There was no comps no refunds or any free breakfast just noise.  I quickly checked out and they could care less.  I wouldn't recommend this hotel just based on my experience, however I was in and out so quickly based on my poor experience and customer service!",September 2013,NA

The competent management of this hotel is keen on caring about every single detail starting from the room and its amenities, the food at its restaurants, but above all the impeccable service. There is truly one place only to stay when visiting Cebu City: The Marco Polo, standing high up on Nivel Hills overlooking the city or the mountains depending on which side of the building you will be staying. Try to have your dinner at the rooftop restaurant or indulge in a thin-crust pizza made in a genuine wood fired brick oven at the El Viento at the pool side.

I get the best of both worlds, being able to conduct business in nearby areas and at the same time have a bit of an R and R as it also has a ""resort"" vibe to it. I especially like staying in the hotel with my family as my kids love the buffet and the pool. I think the place is well-maintained, clean, comfortable, safe, and has that upscale ambiance that somehow makes each guest special. Service is excellent. I can't complain with the way everyone treats us when we stay there. I've never had a problem with check-in, or service in the rooms and restaurants. Most of the time I have my children with me, so it's a big plus when they feel comfortable and I don't hear any  complaints about the bed, the food, etc. It makes our vacation more enjoyable and our time together more memorable.",May 2013,NA

We love the lobby, the security, the elevator ( you have to have a room key to get to your floor - an added security), the service, and the housekeeping. However, I wish they inform us about telephone charges. The last hotel we stayed in, local calls are free. In this hotel, they will charge you 40 pesos and 100or more if you are calling to a cellphone. It was quite a surprise to us to see the charges since no papers explaining so. The bed is a rock. It was big but uncomfortable. The room is spacious. We were in the newly renovated room so it is a plus. I really have great respect for their housekeepers who turned our messy room to a spotless haven. Kudos to them! The security will make you feel safe but not dog-metal-detector intrusive kinda thing (which is apparently becoming common in Cebu). The pool towels are free to use which is nice.",July 2013,NA

ASC1221,Jul 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Two thumbs up!!,"We had a hard time picking a hotel to stay at for our Cebu trip but now I know we made the right choice. We arrived at around 9am, as hoteliers, we know that it's challenging to accommodate early check-in requests. We really appreciate it that they allow us to check-in at 1pm, 1 hour earlier than standard check in time. Currently staying at room 918, great mountain view that I don't even bother to close the curtain at night. The hotel is a little out of the way but that's exactly what we are looking for. Nice quiet place without the noisy traffic. The hotel rooms' furnitures and design are outdated, bathroom is a little small but very comfortable, well maintained and is very clean, which is very important. I will rather stay in a clean old room than a dirty trendy room. The staffs from the reception desk (Catherine), concierge (forgot the name) and restaurants (Paul - Cafe Marco and El Viento) are amazing! They were very friendly, professional, always smiling and always ready to assist. Cafe Marco's buffet breakfast is one of the best I had with a reasonable price. It will be good though if the rooms and bathroom will be refurbished but its just a minor issue for us. Is even better if the bathroom can have seperate shower for safety reasons. You can find a lot of grand, modern hotel but its very hard to find a hotel with staffs that will take care of you and treat you with a SINCERE attitude. Yes! As a hotelier we know what is sincere and what is acting (been there, done that 😊) Will definitely come back if we come to visit Cebu again! P.S. Think twice before you decide to rent a car! The GPS is horrible and we almost die because of it!",July 2013,NA

The interior and exterior of the hotel are very well kept and beautiful.  The rooms are spacious and very well maintained with good amenities - wifi, snacks, good cable selection, etc.  The pool is very relaxing, a decent size, with great drink and food service.

There was a free basket of fruit and there were complimentary snacks at the continental club all day long (though I was too busy to get anything there). I was greeted with nice cards inside the room and the amenities were more complete than the other lower rooms. The room was cleaned each time I would go out and there was turndown service I guess.

The hotel has a building site next door where they are building 'residences' - work is supposed to begin at 10am and finish at 10pm (according to the hotel manager) this is not the case and can lead to a bit too much noise in the evening, especially if you are eating in the pool side restaurant.The food is OK but a bit limited choice - after 1 week here you will be bored by menu.",February 2013,NA

The breakfast buffet is just awesome. There are so many choices, there should be something for everyone. I don't eat lunch or dinner there though, much too expensive. The hotel is a little out of the way but at least you don't have to listen to the sounds of the city at night. The pool area also a very nice feature. The only drawback is that I find the beds to be a little too firm for me but I find that to be the case no matter where I stay.  My favorite part of Cebu City is the Marco Polo hotel.

The bed was comfortable. i must say that the staffs were professional, polite and I felt welcomed by their sincere hospitality. Although I did not particularly like the food due to differences in food preferenc, I find the food acceptable. As usual, I went to the gym for my regular run on the tread mill. I was very impressed and happy with the gym and the ""instrucotr"" there. The gym had the right equipments and was well kept and the instrauctor Raimond was excellent! He gave the right advice and assist when needed and was very friendly. I want to compliment him. This is probably the best gym experience I had in all the hotels I stayed in before.

As reviewers have already pointed out, staff here really are excellent - without exception! Great lobby, wonderful pool area, well equipped gym, international breakfast menu ... Only the rooms are a little plain and a slight let down from an overall 5* experience though everything is clean and in good order. I love the fresh air experience due to the location ...

We just stayed one evening and had booked 3 seaview rooms. Unfortunately one of the seaview rooms was switched to a mountianview room (shantyview) when I questioned this the front desk said no others were available (I thought the purpose of a reservation was to ""reserve"" your room choice) . I thought the rooms were average, decent, but nothing special. My 15 y/o loved the lunch buffet. It was quite large and very nice, we also had breakfast at the buffet which was quite good. Exhausted from our travels earlier in the day, we had ordered room service for dinner, but after going to the pool we had them switch our order to be eaten poolside that evening. The live music was great, the night beautiful and the fact that the hotel is situated high on the montain made the evening very nice. The lobby was nice also with live music in the evening and the staff was very courteous and helpful.

The rate was lower than I expected and the staff were all pleasant and very helpful.  We were having a bad experience with the airlines we used in going to cebu causing us to lose our luggage and to miss my brother's wedding.  I was crying in the lobby and one hotel staff was alarmed that I was having problems so he came immediately to offer his assistance.  I told him that there was actually nothing he could do about it and thanked him.   We never got a single apology from the airlines, but when the hotel concierge learned about our problem, he was the first one to apologize to us (and it wasn't even his fault).  Another lady heard about our problems and gave us 4 additional complimentary drink tickets.  These were simple gestures but we truly appreciated their kindness during a terrible time.  Everything else was good, the rooms were clean and comfortable, the restaurant crew were all helpful, the breakfast was good and the kids enjoyed the use of the pool while the grownups had their complimentary drinks.  There was no problem with transportation, taxis were available just right outside the hotel.  When in Cebu, use this hotel and you will not regret it.",August 2008,NA

And they were sure right - It was a magnificient hotel and I'm so glad Marco Polo resurrected it, because the location and views are quite spectacular if you request a sea view.  The staff are are very friendly but not too  'in your face'.  From the front desk to the ladies who man the lifts - they are all good.  The buffet breakfast at Cafe Marco is amazing.  There is a different chef to cater for all your requirements!  If you want your fruit freshly cut, your pancakes and waffles made to order, or your partial to a Japanese breakfast cuisine - you have it all at Cafe Marco!  Its def one of the best buffet breakfast restaurants I've been to.  As for the swimming pool - what an amazing backdrop of Cebu!
