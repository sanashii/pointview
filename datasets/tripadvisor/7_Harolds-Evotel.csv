We had booked initially for 1 week stay at Harolds Hotel, but before the week was up we decided to stay on longer and in the end the whole of our vacation around two an a half weeks. The staff throughout were excellent. Both the front desk and the morning breakfast staff were so helpful and friendly, attentive and respectful and many of the staff are OJT (on the job trainees) and all credit to them. We had also some artistic house cleaning staff who managed to create a variety of animal figures using towels and displayed on our beds whenever we came back from our daily travels. All in all a very enjoyable stay and we look forward to a return there soon.",March 2022,NA

They are fully booked that day and the usual check-in time is 2 PM but we asked if we can have the early check-in so we can have our time to prepare for the makeup. The room is well lit and clean and salutes the people from the housekeeping team, I know how hard the effort is to make the room clean and smells fresh and to disinfect all the areas to make sure that they are still following the health protocol during this pandemic. I was able to rest and sleep well and not want to go home the next day but of course, I have to.

There are only a few places we could visit to break the boredom and monotony of the immobility that this pandemic has forced upon us. For a restless soul like me, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve found a hotel that offers the comfortable respite of a home away from home. Harolds Hotel offers affordable rates but doesn‚Äôt reek of the cheapness that some other places do. Its well decorated rooms are always impeccably clean, complete with necessities for the stay, and large enough for each family member‚Äôs personal space. The brand of customer service is genuine and consistent from the moment one enters their doorstep until they bid one farewell. Food, although mundane  seem luxurious at Harolds with their delightful selection of local and international fare.

From reception to restaurant everyone we met was friendly and efficient - thank you guys! The hotel is smoker friendly and theres a nice rooftop bar for us rather than the end of the driveway or a schmatty corner. The room was a good size, clean and the bath was a normal sized not one of the mini versions ;) The restaurant was super with the head chef there for every sitting and with an excellent range of foods for local and international guests. Will definately stay again and would highly recommend.",April 2019,NA

I had booked two rooms, the suite and the deluxe room. The rooms were much improved from the last time. I saw a lot less wear. The towels and linens were updated, and the rooms looked refreshed. The wifi was better, still not great. Service would drop every now and then. Another plus was the hot water in the shower. Never had a problem this time. I am glad that management resolved this issue. The breakfast buffet was excellent as always and the roof top bar is a wonderful space to sit and have a drink in the evenings. Will surely be staying here on my next visit.",March 2019,NA
Gerard L,Apr 2019,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Holiday in Harolds Hotel March 2019,"This is a 3.5 star hotel in Cebu City Centre. I stayed there for 4 nights in March 2019. It has a rooftop bar on the 12th floor, and you get a great view of the city at night while listening to  a live band.  It is a slightly older hotel, with single glaze windows, but the rooms are good and big with comfy beds.  They are air conditioned with a safe. The food has a mixture of Asian and European, so the western visitor will be well catered for at breakfast time. The staff are very friendly and always willing to give advice on where to go and how to get there.  Our rooms were taken care of every day by two lovely staff members, Risard and Flor, who were an example of Philippine friendliness and tremendous ambassadors for Harolds Hotel.  Well done to the hotel for the quality of staff they employ.",March 2019,NA

Mia, who was handling my check in, went out of her way to try and make amends and eventually everything worked out. A while later I get a call that she had gotten me an upgraded room to make things easier, meaning she was still working to make things right even after I had said everything was ok. Seriously, overall outstanding service for the hotel class.They have shuttle service to Alaya mall, though you can walk there in less than 10 mins, and the nuttiness of Mango Square is about a 30 min walk or php70 cab ride away.

I rarely eat at hotels. However, I have to say that the buffet tonight was fantastic. The theme was roastings. Presentation, selection, and quality was beautiful. The interaction with staff was so superb that it made me laugh inside. I have never been served with such genuine enthusiasm and grace. The manager, Louvina walked me around to each display, describing each dish in detail and origin. As I didn't have enough hands to carry all of the tastings with me, she and other staff members brought it to my table. The quality was top notch. I was really impressed.

My vacation had started out with disasters happening repeatedly but when I checked into this hotel, the staff all helped me fix my situation and helped me prepare for my travels in the coming days. A boatman had spilled water on my bag and destroyed all my electronic devices(phones, cameras), and soaked my wallet and passport. I lost communication with my family and friends and was stuck. But the employees made many calls and let me use their computer to access emails and get contact info for my family and friends so I can enjoy my vacation. In the short version, this hotel is one of my favorites and I plan to use them again when I visit again.

The set up was good. Food presentation is also quite fine. The staff and personnel are all very helpful. Rooms for improvement maybe to at least put a function room label (name of function room; e.g. ""EMERALD""). The microphones also are sometimes not working well so maybe they have to check them first before use. Over all though, Harold's hotel is a good venue for small functions.",May 2017,NA

I arrived early on the day of arrival and was checked immediately into my room which was a Deluxe Suite. The room was spacious and clean. The staff were friendly, curious and helpful during our entire stay. We graced the roof deck a few times and found the food and drinks to be of great value. One tip, breakfast is amazing but can get very busy so pick your time and be patient. The location of the hotel is good for the Cebu Highlands and for the main shopping malls. We had a great stay for sure and will be back. One final note we booked way in advance and got a great deal.",May 2017,NA

The cocktails and food on the roof top terrace are amazing we went almost every night before dinner, had cocktails then headed down to the buffet. The most amazing item on the buffet is the chocolate brownie with custard, so if you are a chocoholic like me you will love it :) for the price we paid for this hotel we cannot praise it enough.

The rooms are big  clean and they replenish everything from bottled water to toiletries every time you request to fix the room. I really love hotels that provides complete toiletries because that means I can minimize in bringing the basics on my travels. It also has a bath tub if you want to soak in after a tiring day. It even has an iron and iron board for your clothes. I think this was a very nice and thoughtful gesture for their guests. Who ever thought of this idea, I really appreciated it.  Complimentary buffet breakfast is inclusive with the room rate. Breakfast starts at 6 up to 10 in the morning. Food was good. My Japanese colleague told me that he really liked the food. Price wasn't expensive considering it was a hotel restaurant. I just wish they have choices of vegetables in their buffet menu. And for those travelling for business, no worries on getting connected. Wifi at the hotel was fast. Harolds was few minutes away from Ayala Center, Cebu. There are public transportation available if you don't intend to hire a car or a van.

TravellingManOz,Mar 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,An incredible find,"Harold's is an amazing find.  I was scheduled to stay in Cebu City for about 10 days and chose to reside at this hotel for the entire period.  Not only are the tariff prices very reasonable but breakfast is included in the room cost.  The rooms are well appointed and have everything that you should require.  The aircon is a welcome relief after venturing into the heat of the Philippine day.  The prices at the in-house restaurants, and room service, are also reasonable and it is quite easy to decide to stay and eat at the hotel rather than venture out to the neighbouring eating places.  Quality and quantity of servings are excellent.  The staff are very professional and friendly.  Staying there for a lengthy time it was easy to become used to seeing the same faces and having a chat during the different times of the day. There is a rooftop bar and restaurant though I didn't get the opportunity to visit it did read to be worth a look.  The in-house gym is small but has everything that the traveller needs to maintain their fitness.  Laundry can be done in-house or if you are keen you can easily find a local laundry within walking distance.  Ayala Shopping Mall and other brand-name stores are within walking distance.  Overall, highly recommended.  I will definately stay here again when I'm back in Cebu City.",March 2016,NA

Upon check in I got a complementary welcome drink and was given a room on the top floor.  It was spacious and the wifi was decent.    One thing surprised me was the staff who was clearly not working that day and was in her evening gown for her company function.  Instead of heading into the elevator first she held the elevator for us to get in and wished us a pleasant evening.  Mind you, we were in no rush.  Just the little stuff. Impressive!! Minor dislike were the toiletries: the soap felt gritty and chalky, like imitation ivory.  The buffet was tasty, affordable and decently priced, not sure if I would eat it every day but none the less worth the price.",December 2015,NA

pek1098,Mar 2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very Disappointed in Hotel Facilities,"Where to start - from arrival to departure I was very disappointed. Upon arrival we were early so we did not expect to be allowed early check in (although the Seda in Cagayan de Oro did) but I was surprised when the clerk advised me that I could pay a extra 4,000 pesos to check in straight away. We have already paid over 22,000 pesos for a 4 night stay (Executive Room) and they wanted more for a 5 hour early check in. Anyway I said no and we went to Ayala Mall and were told not to come back before 2pm (check in time). We arrived back just after 2pm and were made to wait a further 20 minutes before we were allowed into the room - Unbelievable!!!!!! Anyway we finally were ALLOWED into the room and it was very nice and were glad that we booked this room and that it was Advertised as a Business Hotel with Hi Speed WiFi. Will someone forgot to tell them that Hi Speed WiFi does not time out all the time - I asked re this everyday and was assured the bandwidth would be increase and it was not. So I had to go to the local Mall to access the internet and emails. Then the cleanness of our room was a joke as all they did was empty the bins and replace the toiletries. The bed was only turned down and the sheets were not replaced. The floors were vacuum and the coffee mug I used and glass were left there dirty. I had to take pictures and go downstairs for something to happen (1 photo below). We were just happy to leave there. Also the Buffet Breakfast was well just a average Buffet Breakfast no more to say. Unfortunately after you pay your money you can't leave as they will not refund what you have paid so be wary before you BOOK TOO LONG. After staying at the Seda Hotel in CDO where they were excellent and very accommodating - well I was disappointed and expected more.",March 2016,NA

Kudos to their procedure which is how it should be.This is safe and not on a very area. Ayala Mall is very near.

Agnescord,Jan 2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Friendly but inconsistent service,"Stayed at Harold's in Cebu City for a 3-day business meeting. Location-wise it was perfect. Near enough to the major malls and it is surrounded by good massage spas. Being on a business trip, my breakfasts are quick and less leisurely and well planned per day. One of my colleagues tipped us that they serve ""danggit,"" Cebu's dried fish specialty, on request as part of the buffet. So on my second morning at breakfast I approached a waiter to ask for some danggit. He brought out 4 pieces of the fish with its dipping sauce. As he was serving it to one of my colleagues, I followed up on my own request for danggit. He said that it was already an allocation for 2. I was quite frustrated about this and saw a third colleague seated at a nearby table with a serving of danggit. She had 3 pieces. And as I pointed this out to the waiter, a lady server approached our small clique, added all the danggits served on our table and further reiterated very matter of factly that indeed our portion is good for 3 people. I tried to check if we could get some more but with finality, she said in the local language that indeed that is the only serving they can give us. I was so offended by this since we were so excited to try this popular local specialty only to be selfishly shunned. Poor dealing with guests indeed.

The price was also very reasonable. My only complain was (as it often happens in this country) with the staff. At reception they were extremely slow to verify my room upon checking out.

We packed up our bags and showed up to Harold's Hotel without a reservation hoping they had a room for us.  Luckily for us, they did because this was one of the best hotels I've stayed in.  The front desk and all of the staff were extremely friendly during our entire stay.  They were able to get us into a room immediately and it was like a breath of fresh air.  The rooms are very new and clean.  Equipped with comfortable king size beds, cold air-conditioning and large bathrooms.  It was everything we hoped our first hotel would be, but better.  I know this hotel is sometimes labeled a ""business hotel,"" but we had a great stay here as just vacationers.  My Wifi was a bit spotty, so I called down to the front desk and within minutes Nathen was in my room and fixed me up with a new access point.  Again, great service.  The concierge, Romeo, was also great in helping us rent a car and with other restaurant recommendations.  Breakfast in the morning was a large buffet and very tasty.

Seeing an ironing board beautifully fixed in my room closet was such a view and it really made exclaim ""yes!, yes!"" accompanied by a body gesture as if I won a lottery. And then there's the bath tub that added an extra grin on my face. The spacious room allowed for enough breathing space not just for the weary body after the 5-hour flight delay back in NAIA that day. The soft bed very inviting, the intimate lighting very calming and beautiful mountain view from the room too an added pleasure. The staff are very friendly and the receptionists quick and efficient on the job. They speak good English and they always have a smile on their face.Then there's the Highlights Lounge at the roof deck, such a romantic place to be for dining and evening drink.

MenalS,Nov 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A very Nice Hotel In Cebu.,"We stayed at the Harolds Hotel In October 2015. This is a smaller hotel, but the service and quality is superior. The staff is extremely polite and very efficient. We had booked the Executive Suite, which was of very good size. It had a separate living room, and dinette area. The quality of the furniture and fixtures were very good. The room was extremely clean, and well maintained. The quality of the mattress, linens, towels, pillows, etc were of very good quality. The bathroom was large, clean and modern. However, we did have issues with a lack of hot water on two occasions. We came in late in the evening after a long flight, and were looking forward to a shower. But no hot water. We called down to have it rectified and were told it would be about 10 minutes. However, it was quite a while, and we went to bed without taking a shower. The next morning the water was warmer, but definitely not hot. A similar lack of hot water occurred a few days later one morning. I had a business meeting, and had to leave without taking a shower.  Another issue was the wifi. It was extremely weak and only worked when we sat towards the far end of the couch. Hopefully these two issues were just an anomaly, as the hotel is very good in all other aspects.The location of the hotel is excellent. It is just about a 10 minute walk to Ayala Center, which has numerous restaurant options. Additionally there are many restaurants around the hotel if you do not want to go to the mall. There is also a convenience store at the end of the block. A good place to get water, snacks etc.. The hotel has one restaurant in the lobby which offers breakfast, lunch and dinner. They also have a rooftop bar/restaurant. The rooftop bar was quite amazing. It was extremely serene and had a very soothing atmosphere with mood lighting and pleasant music. They also serve food at the rooftop. The prices are extremely reasonable and the food and drinks are very good. (Excellent thin crust pizza).Overall the hotel was very good. I will definitely stay there again.",October 2015,NA

I have been booked by my company more than a week in advance along with my flight details so they know when exactly will I get to their hotel but its such a shame that they are not professional enough to accomodate me. It was a waste of our company's money. I do sound real frustrated cause I didnt go here for leisure but for business so I hope my rants as a customer is understandable. The front desk staff arent that friendly and would seem like they dont know what to do. I will definitely give my 1 cent to my company on this concern.

Worried, she immediately raised this concern to the FB supervisor and made her wait more than a few minutes before she heard feedback. They did not have ownership of the incident.

So from the airport, we went straight ahead to the hotel for our breakfast.2. After breakfast, around 10am, we asked if we can leave our things to the hotel while we tour around the city. But, since they have an available room, they allowed us to check-in early.3.

During our workshop the room was spacious and again there were a lot of staff to attend to your needs.

Bedding is great. Breakfast buffet good range of options, all the food fresh, the lunch buffet also good with great presentation and value for money.

drjohnled,Jul 2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not quite,"This place was touted to be ""your premiere business hotel"".  Not quite.  Upon check-in, I was given an ""upgraded"" room in the 10th floor.  True, the room was spacious and clean but I was looking for the nice pillows, the soft linens, the memory foam bed.  I kept looking . . .  The bed was hard and so were the pillows.  Split-type airconditioner was difficult to adjust by remote control, and even though I had it at max cool (both temperature and fan speed), the room was still uncomfortably warm.  TV had so many cable channels, except that most of them were not available to view, making it a nuisance to surf from one channel to another.  The remote itself was difficult to handle, like driving a right-hand car for the first time when you're used to a left-hand drive.  A total of only three towels in the bathroom, so when the floor gets wet (and it does), nothing more for the hand and face.  Don't look for facial tissue here. The life-size mirror just outside the bathroom has large faded areas at the bottom (an eyesore).  Needless to say, I've had more memorable nights in other hotels.  Sure, I could have called to complain, but at 11 in the evening and only 1 regular staff behind the front desk (the other two were trainees), who would help?

The one complaint we had was with the wifi, which was very, very, very slow.  For a business hotel this is unacceptable.  Also, for some reason, the mini fridge in the room did not get cold even after we complained and they replaced a defective model which didn‚Äôt work at all.

We have stayed previous to this from Mandarin, Holiday spa for the great gym and Best western. Quite frankly, i'd rather go back to Holiday spa!!!!!   1)When we arrived, after 2 hours with a do not disturb sign, someone rang the bell and opened the door! I got up and said, sorry - we have the do not disturb sigh, the guy said, ""we are just checking if someone is in the room ma'am!"" VERY STRANGE!!!!!! we just checked in have the do not disturb sign and someone wants to check at around 330pm if we are in or not?    2)  The internet never worked in 5days of our stay. We kept going downstairs asking for a new password..they kept giving us a different one but we can never logged in... on the fourth day, we spoke to a very young lady acting as a manager who is clearly not capable- told us that they have no internet for more than 2 weeks and trying to have it sorted. The front could have saved us the trip back and forths and told us about this honestly! GREAT F Service- Not!  They also added on top of the booking.com 22.5 % making it more expensive than agoda and veneer and this does not includes breakfast!!! so beware and look out for that tiny little line.  The manager with all the troubles we have had in this hotel, no assistance from security guard on a car problem by some punks working for some projects in Harols which could have been easily solved by letting us view it on CCTV.. no they do not help or assist you on anything at all or compensate on their shortcomings.  location is fairly poor- the only thing is you have a massage place next door which quite frankly is really dirty. You are better off staying at Best Western Lex-very convenient and their closest competition. They can't even come close to the free breakfast served at Best western lex and location.  I suggest they change the acting manager with someone who can really relate and fix guests issues and not just stand their stupidly smiling acting pretty looking stupid. I  wish we never stayed here. They also made a mistake on our room service which already took forever, they delivered spaghetti bolognese and i ordered pesto-penne with chicken. they argued this is what i ordered- first of all- i do not eat beef and my favorite is pesto. The order was never changed and we still got charged for it.  Big mistake moving here. Poor breakfast, poor location compared to the previous hotels we stayed nearby, no pool, no gym... really... whats so special about this place? there is hardly any customer service, you get bothered (twice in 4nights) on a do not disturb sign mid afternoon checking if someone is in and why cuz the housekeeping had already done the room and they do not have turn down service so what is this for? We own a hotel- you do not do this esp if housekeeping knew there is activity in this room/ cleaned it while you were out. This is only a procedure done when the do not disturb sign had been on the door for 2 or more days and had not been entered by housekeeping. Are they trying to check if someone is not in the room but pretending by putting the sign and maybe come in to steal something? Bcuz they rang the bell..do not announce who they are and tried to open the door twice. NOT SAFE AT ALL. very fishy.",October 2013,NA
John Milton B,Dec 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Harol's Haven,"This lovely new hotel in Lahug lives up to its great reviews.  Arriving well after midnight because of a delayed flight and very slow customs, we were pleased to find Harold's doorman and front desk staff ready for us with a smile and a quick and easy check-in.  The room was clean and quiet, the black out drapes worked and the bed was comfortable.  The combo bath and shower has a big window that open into the bedroom, which is a little odd, but it has a remote control operated blind for privacy, which was even odder but practical. The only down side is the rack rate, which fortunately we were not paying.  It's one of the highest in the city and while nice enough, Harold's really doesn't compete with other hotels in that higher price range.  The buffet breakfast was excellent, varied and good value.  We'd definitely go back, but not on a weekend, when the price is ridiculously high, even with an online discount.",December 2013,NA
seeDworld97,Dec 2013,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible customer service! The WORST!,"from wifi not working, they keep giving you wifi passwords and never explains that it had actually not worked for 2 weeks was just stupid. The front office manager lady admitted it after the 5th day of complaining we never get internet!  We were staying at Best Western for 2 wks and wanted to try something new... we moved to Harolds and REGRET IT!! best western lex is a much better location, perfect wifi, amazing breakfast, GREAT staff.. unlike all of it the opposite to Harolds. They have this front office manager who just shows her face to you smiles and listen to your issues- i don't think she has any idea about customer service or how to deal with issues. ... never corrects it. One night, We parked our car just infront of the hotel with cctv.. we requested if we can view it bcuz we parked less than 30 minutes, went to the room to change and came down and it was completely flat. there were a group of young boys working for HAROLDS and we requested if we can view the cctv..this was not accommodated. It was 10pm and we struggled in the dark as we were changing tires and not one of the male staff, security, bellman and other staff offered help..flashlight or anything or to call anyone. They just watch us. Also, we got tricked on booking with them, the price on direct booking on their website showed the same price as Veneer and so we chose to book direct on the next night to help them save from paying commission only to find out they have to tax us 22.5% more with no breakfast. While all was inclusive with veneer and booking.com with breakfast!!!  when we complained that there was a mistake... they right away deleted the one in veneer and booking.com but we took photos before they deleted it! It was by the way against their contract with agoda and booking.com or any online agents to offer something cheaper on one agent and not on the others. The young lady just said simply- the reservations department had overlooked it and not updated the system.No offers or anything and since we have fully paid it- we have no more choice. If we have not paid it- WE WILL LEAVE IN A HEARTBEAT and go back to Best western Lex or Mandarin. There are so many new hotels in cebu.. do not stay here!!! The location is almost the same as best western but no 7 eleven, no food place, no shops, no pharmacy..while u even get mcdo next door and great restos in Best western, Mandarin- cross the road and you are in ayala. Book somewhere else. The service on this place will ruin your holiday!",September 2013,NA

lomigirl,Sep 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Fantastic value -- and meets Western standards.,"Stayed here for 4 nights and loved it! The best part, in my opinion, is the service. Like others have mentioned, Harolds' staff provides 5-star service -- everyone is so kind, friendly and helpful. My room was great, too. I booked a deluxe room with two twin beds, for my mum and me. The room was spacious, the AC worked well, the beds were comfortable, and the water pressure and temperature were great. The wifi didn't work on the 9th floor, but the LAN connection provided by the hotel was fast and perfectly fine for my needs. Some may think that the breakfast buffet is small, but I thought it was the right size with good food -- a mix of American and Filipino dishes. (I'm not into huge buffets with average food that some people seem to drool over.) Went to the rooftop bar once, and they served tasty drinks for a very reasonable price. The guests are a nice mix of people from the Philippines, other Asian countries and Europe. After a 4-day trip to Palawan, I came back to Cebu and stayed at another popular hotel for the last 4 days of my vacation (hint, it's across the street from Ayala). Huge mistake.

The rooms are comfy, spacious, and clean, this being a relatively new hotel. The staff are friendly and accommodating, eager to please their guests. The food in their breakfast and lunch buffet is okay, but nothing to write home about. During breakfast, my companions and I were wondering why they didn't have the food that Cebu is famous for. Where are the luscious, golden Cebu mangoes? And how come they didn't have the crispy, salty friend danggit? We forgot all about that as we were checking out of the hotel. The amiable General Manager of Harolds himself sent us off with a warm smile, a handshake, and a sincere invitation to visit their hotel again anytime we were in Cebu. All in all, a pleasant stay in a nice little hotel. So when visiting Cebu, why not Harolds?",July 2013,NA

The food was ok, but it reminds me of any other place you get hotel food from, the rooms were clean and offered an outstanding view of Ayala and the surrounding area.

Gi G,May 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Clean, nice and modern - the higher your suite, the better","The location is nice, not far from the port which is how we arrived and not that far from the airport either. The room is spacious and modern although I had an initial concern about the bed size. I requested our travel agent to arrange a minimum queen sized bed for the bf and me and the bed in the Superior Room is absolutely not a queen, though the staff said it is. Looks like beds sizes for single, queen, double or the 'matrimonial' are inconsistent so if you are tall or big it is important to check. Our room had 2 single beds so we asked them to connect them for us to have a 'bigger' bed.  We were at the 10th floor and had a good view of the city, both day and night. Fixtures and bathroom are modern. Buffet breakfast which is included in our package is ok. Since this is my first arranged tour with an agent I didn't think of it as much but for the next leg of our trip I researched the hotels we were booked with for reviews. I am already at the hotel when I looked it up online and it seemed decent. Have at least one dinner or late night drink at the rooftop bar, it is a really nice location and view. If you book through a travel agent the airport/ seaport pickup is not refundable even if you had other arrangements or misunderstandings with the agent. It is a comfortable place to rest after spending the whole day exploring Cebu, which is what we did for the 3 days we were here.We had day 1-city/historical tour and zipline 1, day 2-island hopping and snorkeling, day 3- mountain and hill tour and zipline 2.

Trays always out of food and u have to ask if there is some more food coming. My third day, I decided to eat in the nearby mall. Room is spacious and always clean. The only problem I had was the phone line connection, everytime I called out, line got cut off. I was told that every call there is a charge and I  notified the receptionist about the problem, she said ""We will take care of it Sir"". Staff are friendly, they do everything to make my stay a memorable one, but I know they are only doing their job. Management? I end up paying those disconnected calls.

Not something you can count on in the Philippines. Also, check in and check out was fast and smooth. Again, sometimes an issue at other hotels. An overall good experience. However, breakfast after 9:00 am will leave you picking at leavings and snatching accessories off of other tables. Do try the attached coffee shop for delicious flavored coffees and aperitifs.

The first thing I usually do in arriving at a hotel was to adjust the temperature to my liking, but this one, this one was just perfect for me. The bed also looked inviting, unfortunately, being a business trip I ended up spending less hours in bed as I would have liked in the first place. They have the usual complimentary bottle of water, coffee and tea. They have an ironing board in one of the closets, together with the iron, of course. One thing I noticed that is usually absent in other hotels was the flashlight under one of the side tables. Now that would be handy in case of brownouts and other emergencies. What needs improvement is their internet access. It was too slow for my taste. They also would have to improve their food offerings. I mean, I was in Cebu, but it didn't taste like Cebu.

We all enjoyed the hotel -- clean, nicely appointed , its staff -- friendly, efficient, helpful--- and the dining outlets --- food was good, and the bar has good ambience and music. Value for money, this hotel is more than ok. About the food, we actually asked (nicely!) if we could buy lechon outside and eat it inside the hotel Resto. Of course we ordered other stuff from the Resto too. But the staff was very accommodating. When we wanted to eat batchoy soup which was not in their menu, the kitchen staff cooked it for us! How can one complain about that? I can understand the hotel policy against bringing in outside food, ESP into the rooms as the food aroma can cling to the carpet and curtains. Let's remember that Cebu prides itself with the smoked fish (danggit) which has a very strong aroma. When we went to the market to buy some stuff, the smell clung to our shirts. The front desk was also very helpful when we wanted to rebook for earlier flights out of Cebu. In fact, everyone was very cheerful and accommodating. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone.
