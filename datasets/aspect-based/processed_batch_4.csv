"The best Shangri-La I had ever been to. The check in was very quick and the staffs was very efficient. The room was big and had a TV with a drinks bar.( you’ll have to pay for each drink you drank. The price is listed on the table counter)
There is a balcony with a nice view( depends on which wing you stay at). There are many activities at in the place. There is a swimming pool with a depth of 2.3m, 1.2m and a young children’s pool. There is a slide for small ones and a bigger slide for children from 5-12 years old. Beyond the swimming pool, there is the beach. At the shore, you can see many snapper fish and sergeant major fish. There is a barrier to ensure that guest do not go outside. (Pls be careful if you are swimming further out in the deep waters, there are titan triggerfishes, jellyfishes and sea-snake.). There are also water sports activity in the beach such as kayaking, jet ski and many more. Shangri- La also has a arcade centre. You can also have some land activities like ping pong, volleyball, badminton. You can rent them as it is complimentary.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This is the first time we stay on Shangri-La and the expectation was high before or stay. But we was disapointed. Especially the rooms is very old fashion, dark and a lots of wear and tear damages. It is old carpets on the floor which not look clean at all. The balcony where small and narrow with large table and chairs. About time for an renovation to keep up the standard. Our room where in the ocean wing, but could not see any difference between ocean and main wing. Our room where in 3rd floor and there was a water leak in the hallway, It can be of this reason the smell and indoor climate in the room was poor. We did change room to 4rd floor and it became better. The outdoor facilities are nice and huge, beach is nice but can be a tip to bring your beach shoes. The restaurants are good, but of course overpriced. The Chinese restaurant and the buffet restaurant Tides is the best one. The lunch over in the week days was a good deal. Good breakfast. Overall good hotel, but too pricy compared to quality and service. Not worth the money and will not stay at this hotel again.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"We stayed 5 nights in an Ocean Wing room with our 1 year old and 3.5 year old and everything about the resort was fantastic. This is truly the perfect resort for a relaxing family vacation. Every staff we encountered was incredibly helpful and catered to our every need to the finest detail. We ate most of our meals within the resort because they were surprisingly delicious (Acqua for Italian food and Tea of Spring for Chinese food).

For our little ones, they had so much fun at the water playground by the pool and the Adventure Zone, which is a huge indoor multi level playground. There's so much more for the kids to do beyond just a pool at any other resort.

The best part for us was snorkeling at the house reef. There was a huge variety and amount of coral and fish to see. We especially appreciated their efforts to grow corals in certain areas and cordoned off certain areas for conservation purposes. Even the food we ordered on the beach was high quality and delicious.

We also went diving with Scotty's Dive Adventure, which was a dive operator on premise. This made our dive excursions incredibly quick so we didn't have to be away from the kids for too long.

Lastly, when I mention their attention to providing fine service, this includes prepacking breakfasts for each of us so we can take them on our way out to the airport at 3:30 am.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"So i have been to shangri-la many times/ to stay and for dinner by the water-

I wanted to take my wife out for a romantic meal at the Cove restaurant at Shangri-la.
She got dressed to the nines together with high heels and her nicest finery.

The hotel is about 30 minutes from the house and we arrived exactly on time.

We stopped at the main lobby entrance only to be told that there was no more valet parking- WHAT!!!

Parking was about 400 metres away.

I frowned and said ok- can one of your golf carts pick us up there and take us to the Cove restaurant?

Sorry but the golf carts are gone too :(

WOW!! From the parking to the restaurant is at least a kilo-meter and with my wife in heels, 28 celsius I said we would go elsewhere.
Way to go Management we will never be back.
We went to Abaca instead and had our romantic dinner where customer service is well understood",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
Our family stayed here last summer and I was very impressed.. Comparable to resorts I've stayed at in Bali and Guam. I loved the resort vibe and I felt very comfortable leaving my children to swim and play without my having to keep my eye on them at all times. It goes without saying that the Shangrila signature hospitality is expected but what makes it special is they give guests equal treatment regardless if you are foreign or local. We got the family room and it was the best decision for our family of 5. Separate bathtub and shower area means my kids can bathe at the same time. I loved the milk and cookies at turndown service and the complimentary wine. Lots of good dining options as well. Can't wait to go back!,Food:Comfort & Facilities
My family went to Shangri-La to avail their lunch buffet. I politely asked the gentleman at the lobby area for valet parking service since it was raining and I was with a Senior Citizen. I got shocked when he informed me that they don't have this service. I visited several other resorts in Mactan which are not even 5 star and they have valet parking service! It was raining when we went to their parking area and we saw a valet parking sign there in bold yellow paint so why bother placing this sign when they don't even offer this service??,Staff:Value for money
"My husband and I just returned from a fantastic trip to this hotel. I highly recommend upgrading to the ocean wing package (airport transportation is included for free) We very easily found the Airport shuttle rep once we collected our baggage and he kindly took our baggage from us. We asked if there was a duty free and he informed us there was but you have to go outside and upstairs. Our first day there we were informed breakfast was available until 12pm in Ocean Club (Saturday and Sunday) we were thrilled because were starving! The food was nice and we enjoyed the view waiting for our room to be available.

Our room was nice and cozy and had a beautiful view of both the hotel grounds and the ocean. There are some that face the water 100% so if you want that be sure to ask in advance. The room was cleaned and refilled with the one of the best hotel products in my opinion of lotions/shampoo/razor etc.

The beach is beautiful and make sure you take advantage of the free snorkeling (again included with club) The fish feeding and the reefs were one of the best I have ever done!

The nightly family/happy hour is fantastic as well. From 2 hours kids are allowed and 2 hours it is adult only. They offer top shelf liquors, beers, and wine. Every restaurant we ate in had delicious food-not once did we regret ordering anything! If you are hungry on the beach try the wings and sweet potato fries- YUM!

Lastly I want to thank the staff for being so kind and welcoming. From Neil and Mila on the beach service, Jove and Erwin at the Buko bar and lastly Jimmel from the Ocean wing your service was much appreciated! Salamat! :)",Staff:Food:Location
"It’s taken me sometime to put this review up but I’ve thought so many times to thank Sean who was working at the pool and gave my sister and I a tour of the resort one day.
We then kept bumping into Sean around the resort on the days that followed and he was an absolute delight each time we saw him. He did everything for the 6 days we were there to make our stay very memorable. Sean is studying hospitality and tourism and my sister and I hope he succeeds in every way! Thank you Sean.
The food was sensational and attention to detail for our group was excellent and we’d highly recommend the resort!",Staff:Food
"You can never go wrong with Shangri-la. And every penny spent is all worth it. We spent my birthday weekend here in this wonderful island of Mactan in Cebu and you can say, it is ok not to go out of the resort since they can keep you and your kids busy in a 3d2n weekend. The kids would not want to go anywhere. They have the private beach and marine sanctuary, the water-world pool, an adventure zone and an arcade. Every night they keep you entertained with a live show during dinner. Breakfast is buffet. They have several restaurants inside the resort that you could choose from for lunch. Amenities here are two thumbs-up!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This hotel is about a 15 minute ride from the airport. The hotel has 8 storeys and consists of two wings, the main wing and the ocean wing. The ocean wing is more expensive than the main wing and comes with more perks. There's an airport shuttle (free for guests in the ocean wing). The hotel has several restaurants and bars. Many bars have an early evening happy hour. The ocean wing has a club lounge which provides breakfast, small snacks and non-alcoholic drinks during the day, and evening cocktails. The food in the restaurants was excellent and very tasty. There are two pools (one is exclusive for ocean wing guests). There's also a small beach. The hotel has beautiful landscaped gardens. The property is very clean. The best thing about this hotel is it's employees. Every employee was extremely friendly, full of smiles and always willing to do anything for you. I stayed in the ocean wing and the only negative thing I could say is that the rooms need an upgrade. Don't get me wrong, they were clean and housekeeping was very good. It's just that the rooms are outdated with threadbare cushions on the sofa, worn carpet, peeling wallpaper, etc. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend the Shangri La.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Simply amazingly PERFECT. We cannot ask for more. Everyone was smiling and kind: The resident manager himself (such a handsome, ultra-friendly guy), everyone in Ocean Club Lounge (Clyde, Sigmund, Veronica, Genevieve.. the wait staff (am sorry, i cannot remember everyone's name), the staff by the Pool and Beach area, from borrowing snorkel, beach shoes, ordering drinks; Breeze, Tides and Acqua restaurant wait staff... this is exemplary Filipino hospitality. :-). My 2 guests and i were utterly enthralled. Calling up Guest Services, requests through Housekeeping (Rolan, etc), even needing a cab, being assisted by Concierge, getting medicine from the Clinic, assisted with beach/pool towels... gosh, everyONE was so friendly, so helpful, so smiling... even when we know that the hotel staff have been on their feet the whole day. Even the airport greeter for the free airport transfer was so easy to talk to, so accommodating. I salute you, Mactan Shangrila, for delivering amazing services. The pools were always clean. The beaches were WITHOUT SEA URCHINS and JELLYFISH! And our Veranda Suite was absolutely perfect: air con was as it should be, the showers, hot water, beds.. and yes, the Club Lounge happy hour. And you gave us the privilege of checkin early, even the kindest gesture of offering us breakfast for free. Your thoughtfulness and kindness are incomparable... I will surely come back! Sincerely grateful for everything! Take care of your people... they are the ones who make you genuinely 5-star!",Staff:Food
"This review is a bit delayed since we stayed in Shangri-La Mactan last March. This is our first time in this resort. I stayed in an Ocean Wing room with my husband and son. I really liked the privacy, and the fact that we had our own breakfast buffet, restaurant and pool, separate from those staying at the main wing. I absolutely loved the food!

The grounds of the resort are quite vast, which gave us an opportunity to do a lot of exploring. I especially appreciated the kids' play area, which gave my child something to do.

Overall, it was a very pleasant experience. Glad to see that Shangri-La's standards of hospitality and service are very consistent no matter what the location is!",Food:Location:Staff
"Beautiful hotel, great, clean beachfront! Excellent service, hassle free and smooth from check in to check out... love that these guys are growing corals, and taking steps to marine life conservation (scheduled fish feeding using organic feed)...
staff is courteous and super friendly, and truly appreciate the little thoughtful gestures like serving cold watermelon at the poolside, offering cold service water, warm pool towels and prompt reply to concerns (sent maintenance in 10 mins to check the aircon which we thought wasnt functioning well). Food was great, though there were more food choices at tides vs aqua for breakfast. Though the view at aqua early morning kinda made up for it overall I will highly recommend this resort.
I think the next step would be to make it totally eco friendly by refusing plastic straws and toothbrushes (there are bamboo ones), and changing the plastic packaging of the toiletries... hmm... maybe, dispensers in the bath would be more ecofriendly than thousands of little plastic bottles...",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri-La Mactan is my second home in Cebu. Nobody is perfect in this world, but if anything goes wrong, speak to them and they will make it right for you.

I’m immensely grateful to the wonderful staff from the top down to housekeeping and cleaning crew. They’re always smiling greeting you and assist when you need help. Being disabled is not fun but coming to this paradise puts a smile on my face!

From reservations, check in, in room dining, Tea of Spring, Tides, Aqua, Ocean Lounge, Health Club, Beach, Pool was a wonderful experience. Saira who checked me in, Jonathan who brought my luggage to my room, Joe Marie and his entire staff at Tea of Spring, both housekeeping guys (sorry forgot your names), Jaybe, Clyde and their entire staff at the Ocean Lounge, the guys at the pool outside Aqua, the staff at Aqua for breakfast, the staff at Tides and I’m amazed with how vigilant the lifeguards are when I was at the main pool enjoying after a dinner stroll of the amazing grounds swim.

I’ve one to enjoy luxury when I’m on vacation. I want to be pampered and I want my money’s worth! The Chi Spa is to die for. It’s a whole world within a resort. You walk around the perfectly landscapes grounds of the resort and follow a path that will take you to the world of Chi. You will immediately relax the minute you walk into the Chi compound.

"My family has always loved Shangrila so it was natural that when my sister in law and their group from the states decided to visit, we told them let’s got to Shangrila! And Shangrila did not disappoint! we were a big group of 24 and we did not have any problems. We had constant tables at Tides for breakfast as we were up early thanks to Darren. The kids enjoyed all the watersports.
Lastly, I don’t know what system Nika, the front office manager, had implemented but we were checked out in less than 15mins! And we were six rooms with charges to boot! So Kudos Nika! Advise to those checking in, just ask any of the staff of Shangrila. They are very knowledgeable and they will really try to make your stay memorable",Staff:Food
"The only thing I wish I did differently with this reservation is....I wish I booked it for a longer trip.
This place is truly paradise island.
We stayed in the Ocean Wing with ocean views....we opted not to have the club access as we didnt see any point for it.

I read a review before I booked that suggested to book the Ocean Wing....it was worth the extra $$

The hotel really didnt explain much of the everyday stuff so I hope you read my tips:
1. the hotel Wifi has no sign-in so just click it and you are logged in
2. Ocean Wing has it's own special check-in....so dont go to main lobby
3. The ocean wing pool closes at 6PM and main pool is open until 9PM
4. everything is extra....including the water bottles in the mini fridge

Make nice with Housekeeping and you will get some extras....free water bottles and extra toiletries.
Be prepared to pay more for food here....and use your Golden Circle discounts.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"We stayed a week and it is hard to begin since compliments are abundant. We found them to provide excellent facilities and beautiful grounds with scenic ocean and wonderful reef.
Above all else though, was the exceptional service! Every single staff regardless of role greets you with a smile and hello every time you cross their path.

The food is pretty good generally, but best at Aqua. However, we had the pleasure of some catered meals for an event and these provided phenomenal food choices and were very delicious.

The ocean front is lovely - come early and get a spot under the huts to avoid overcooking in the sun! Or there are multiple pools so easy enough to find the right vibe.

The dive shop is one of the best you will find. If novice you are in good hands, if experienced you will recognize their expertise. If diving is not your thing, the snorkelling is incredible in the marine sanctuary straight out from the beach.

Gym is quite well equipped and has pleasant staff, provides nice views of the well manicured grounds, and has a lovely sauna and jacuzzi.

The Chi Spa is serene and luxurious. Come early to enjoy the plunge pool and saunas and enhance your experience.

The rooms are spacious, with comfortable beds and good pillows. Very clean. The cleaning staff are super sweet and very thorough. The air conditioning works exceptionally well. The balcony is suitable with a nice view and comfy chairs. The room has all the amenities.

We highly recommend this resort to any visiting the Philippines.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location

"My family and I stayed in Shang Cebu for a night before flying out. I wanted my 9 months old baby and 21 months old nephew to enjoy the beach. From concierge to reception down to f&b it was amazing. Ingred from Tides was fabulous.
I rated a one star despite the other positive experience because the kid's club attendant was definitely not a shang personality. My nephew and I went to the toddler zone close to 9am and the lady (old lady with specs) was there and did not even bother to assist and just told us we need to wear socks. No smile, no body language of wanting to assist which is the essence of hospitality. There were no kids so she could have had some guest satisfaction instead she was too busy with her PC that she couldnt be bothered to look up and ask if we need anything. When asked regarding the toddler zone, she made me feel that I am wasting her time from her PC and she made me feel like I am a nanny thats why she doesnt bother to assist. I strongly believe she needs a refresher training on your core modules of Shangrila as she will be the bad apple in your hotel and will continue to pull your scores down.",Staff
"My husband And I stayed at Shangri-La Mactan Island Resort and Spa from June 30, 2018 to July 2, 2018. Our reservation and booking was but perfect and on point because of Ms. Myres Llido. We stayed at room 4013 located at the hotel’s Ocean Wing. Our needs from the bed set up to water and bath gel was accommodated impressively by Samuel. He was the best housekeeping staff I’ve encountered so far. He went the extra mile and always greeted us with a smile. On July 1, 2018, we had breakfast at tides. We were seated, greeted and assisted by Ms. Guia Daydayan. She made our breakfast experience worth our while. On July 2, 2018, we had breakfast at Acqua. Breakfast there was a lot better since there were less people so it was quiet and more relaxed. There I met Ms. Edellwise. She was a perfect host, very attentive and accommodating. She I believe shows what Shangri-La stands for. She made our breakfast extra special and actually played a big part in our relaxing staycation due to the exceptional service she gave. After breakfast we swam in Shangri-La’s beautiful beach and even if the tide was so high we felt extra safe because of the service and assurance for our safety presented by their life guard Kristorey. He educated us on proper safety and kept a close watch on my neice. I would truly say that Shangri-La not only offers great ammenities from the rooms to the beach to the restaurants that serve scrumptious food but what makes Shangri-La Mactan worth coming to is their staff. Kudos and thank you to Ms. Myres, Ms. Guia, Ms. Edellwise, Mr. Kristorey and Mr. Samuel for making our stay memorable.",Food:Staff:Location
"My wife and I just spent a week here with my parents. The facilities are top notch, the food is very good, activities are excellent. The beach, albeit man made, is very nice, and there is lots of coral and such to snorkel around.

We stayed in the ocean wing, and the room was very spacious and comfortable. The staff was universally helpful and friendly.

I’m not usually a fan of huge resorts myself. What’s the point of going to a place like Cebu and hermetically sealing yourself off behind a gate with a bunch of other tourists? But if you’re just looking for a relaxing beach vacation, this is a good place to do it.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
I came to Mactan for diving and for a luxurious vacation and time alone. Shangri-La provided all of it. The service was excellent and the rooms were wonderful. The property is expansive and you can wander for hours on the groomed lawn. They have a wonderful spa and an amazing Dive Center...if you want luxury on Mactan this is the place. Two caveats - they cater heavily to families so children are always around plus the only negative was my check out experience. i waited in line for 15 minutes and the young lady at the desk still refused to go over my bill. I needed to leave so caught my car to the airport without being allowed to review my bill. Otherwise an amazing place!,Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money

"This is the first time I had done solo travel where I stayed at the hotel alone and I truly found paradise. The whole experience was just a luxurious bliss and is really memorable. The place was really beautiful and has a lot of activities packed especially during the summer.

Pros:
-The beach was stunning, it is so fun to explore because the water was so clear and you can see a lot of fish that you can swim with. The beach was also long and beautifully designed, there were a lot of bench scattered and they also have a mini-exhibit at the beach. The sand was so fine and white. There were also very helpful staff that can lend you life jackets for snorkelling and beach towels.
-They also had a lot of swimming pools that were extremely fun! I enjoyed all of the pools such as the infinity pool, the deep pool, and there was also a massive pool where you can shoot some hoops. They even gave out complimentary watermelon pops in the pool area for guests which was really a plus!
-The place is massive and is breathtakingly beautiful! The place is really for instagram goals where you can just stop anytime and capture really great photos
-The food at the breakfast was scrumptious and is the best food among all the hotels in Cebu. There were a lot of choices and all of the choices were delicious!
-The rooms were spacious, clean and well-maintained. The toilet also has a bidet(which is not common for hotels). The bathroom size was on the bigger side.
-The hotel staff were courteous polite and very attentive.

Cons:
-It is far from the city so if you're looking to explore outside the hotel, you need a ride.
-Everything is expensive (but definitely worth it!)
-The beach closes too early at 6pm

I went hotel hopping in Cebu and stayed here, at JPark, and at Movenpick. Shangri-La Cebu is definitely on my top spot in ranking among the 3 hotels. You just get the best of the best here and you can't go wrong. Hopefully I can go back here again some day!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"This is one of the nicest traditional resorts (if not the best) in Mactan island. But...you will pay accordingly.

If budgeting and worrying about the cost of activities, food, etc., are a concern, then you probably will not enjoy your time here. That being said (and you have a budget that allows you to spend freely) then your experience will be terrific.

Also this is a very family friendly resort so set your expectations as such....better to go to one of the beautiful boutique hotels along the coast if you want a more romantic getaway.

If you have a family, then you won’t be disappointed as the accommodations and amenities are excellent and too long to list. Go early to the beach or pools to stake out the best lounge chairs. We also were given fish food at the beach to feed the fish in the shallows....pretty cool, especially for children. Lots of water activities to also sign up for and all are very professionally managed and run. All the staff are friendly and helpful. And lots of restaurant/food options on site.

We were never refunded, hotel could not find transaction so watch out if you pay with international cards because they have no way of tracing those transactions and find that to be the perfect excuse to rip you off.

Check in was fast and efficient, even made more so with the Golden Circles Club. My room was ready when we landed at an ungodly time past midnight due to take off delay from Manila. I always love staying in Shangrila hotels. The room, the service and, most of the time, the food are excellent. I really loved the view from my room (although with the exchange rate this year, the room rates were wow!) this time. In Shang Mactan, I love having breakfast at the Lounge more than at the cafes. The place is cozy and the view is fantastic. I can also laze a bit more and can be left to my own pace and “me-time” when needed.

"Stayed 2 nights in April 2018 with 3 young children aged 5,4 and 2 years old.

The experience starts from the Mactan Airport, we were greeted by a shangri-la representative. He was very welcoming and friendly. He escorted us to the pick up point for the hotel’s shuttle bus which was included. (I’ve seen some reviews that mentioned the shuttle bus was not included, as we were staying in the ocean wing this service was complimentary)

It was only when we got to the hotel we realized that there were two entrances the main lobby and the ocean wing entrance.

The ocean wing entrance were for patrons that had club lounge access or staying the within the wing. Despite arriving really early, around 8am, the check in was smooth, friendly & professional. Kind enough to let us use facilities while our room was being prepared.

The good:
Tides buffet - experienced both the breakfast and dinner. The evening buffet had a lechon (suckling pig) ceremony
Mini arcade - pool tables and karaoke system.
The hotel - overall the hotel is immaculate and of high class however some details maybe dated which adds to the feel.

The great:
Club lounge - fantastic views, wonderful staff. They lounge offered premium brands and had high quality food throughout the day. Very child friendly, even had a tv room full of games and books for children.
Kid zone - large soft play area which were for kids between 5-12 years old. And a smaller zone for infants to 4 years old.

The unforgettable:
Beach - although man made, it was incredibly beautiful. As a part of the ocean club package the use of non motorized equipment were free such as snorkeling equipment etc. Feeding this fish was an amazing experience, hundreds of fish surround you and swim up to your hand.
View - the view from the balcony was amazing (room was on the 8th floor)
Poolside - ocean wing has it’s own pool and one of the attendants noticed that we had been sun bathing for a while and suggested we used natural fresh aloe Vera, however we had only brought our own shop bought after sun lotion, then reached over to the nearest aloe Vera plant and took some of the leaves then advised us how to apply it.
Customer service - one of our kids had lost one of their shoes on the site and to our surprise they were able to find it and deliver it to it room, considering the size of the resort and how many guests, we were amazed.

Unfortunately we weren’t able to note down every member of staff we encountered but we do remember all of them being professional and very welcoming.

"Just 15-20 minutes from the Cebu International Airport, with free shuttle bus this is the best place to stay for visiting Cebu. The grounds are huge - about 30 acres and several pools to enjoy. The beach is small, but the variety of water sports are a lot.

The dining is great with the International buffet for breakfast and dinner is the best. Don't bother trying to find any dining outside the hotel. And if the evening dinner show and pig roast is available, don't miss it. More entertaining than a Hawaiian Luau.

"Overall the resort has a nice selection of restaurants and pools with a good layout, but the service quality is definitely not what you'd expect from Shangri-la. Also, there are some rooms with noise issue.

We booked an ""ocean club room"" with extra cost expecting resplendent views of the Mactan Sea as the description on their website. You can't even call it a sea view. Almost half of the ocean club rooms will structurally face a bunch of palm trees and another hotel buildings with very little sea in the right corner. In addition, if you're unlucky like us they'll put you in the rooms right under the club lounge. On the day we arrived after hours of flights we had a very tough night because of the noise of dragging furniture, vacuuming, shoe/high heel sounds, etc. coming from the upper floor almost all day long, and those noises were very very clear as if the ceiling is just a thin layer of wood or so. We not only couldn't sleep well at night but also had to wake up very early in the morning thanks to the noise of preparation for the breakfast in the club lounge. Some of you would probably know what it is like if someone wakes up your sleeping baby. We really didn't want to waste our time repacking and unpacking a whole lot of the baby stuff we brought along but had to ask for room change as we couldn't stand the noise for any more night.

Next day I went to the front desk to explain what we went through, and unsurprisingly the staff seemed to be quite aware of the noise issue which must have been already claimed by many other guests. He promised a feedback by the evening, which never was provided, and I had to call the guest service twice to have a guy visiting our room to ""double-check"" (if I was lying?) and to call his boss called duty manager or whatever who never answered the phone call. After hours of complaining the manager lady finally called me giving all kinds of excuses rather than any sincere apologies and downgraded our room to lower floor with even less view of the sea which they didn't even call a club floor until last year. The whole process took much longer than I expected, because the way they react was very unprofessional and they seem to have a serious communication problem as I had to explain exactly the same thing to many different people. Moving itself was not smooth as well. We had to wait outside the room for a guy who was supposed to come back in 5 mins for more than 10 minutes at 10 pm with all our luggage and the baby who couldn't go to bed that late. Not done. We found the carpet in the new room incredibly dirty when we moved the sofa to make a bed for the baby, and I had to make many calls for missing slippers etc. because the guest service didn't even pick up the phone. The worst part of all this is the fact that they test their guests. They should've fixed the problem before they sell things to guests, but they rather ignored it and just tested their guests with things with fault hoping that it will just pass. I believe this is a serious attitude issue especially for a 5 star hotel supposedly with high standards.

Another thing that I haven't seen at any other 5 star hotels in the world, other than the guest service not answering the phone call, is the flies in the indoor buffet restaurant. They were so many that we had to literally keep shaking one hand to shoo them away before we finally had to move from the table near the door to another one inside. We were so much disturbed by many flies at Breeze, their beach-side bar, but that's kind of understandable as it's outside. However, flies in the indoor breakfast buffet restaurant is a different story. I don't even want to think about what it would be like in their kitchen. They not only failed in hygiene management but also tested guests, again. They first try with some guests before solving the problem, and then give something else if it doesn't work out. If they didn't know about the flies at all in the first place then it's another serious problem. Either way they failed to deliver a proper service to their guests.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"It was a last minute decision to squeeze in a Cebu trip during our vacation in Philippines. I was hesitant mainly because the beaches in Mactan are man-made but we were swayed by the hotel having a marine sanctuary where we can actually snorkel.

Cebu was a jump-off point to Siargao and it worked out quite well for us. We were also fortunate that although the skies were overcast, it hardly rained. There was wind ""habagat' and it made for a comfortable stay. I'm posting this two weeks after our visit this month, July. The same week we were in Cebu, some parts of Luzon were getting soaked with heavy rains from a Typhoon.

So I'll start off with my 'quibbles'. Minor issues . Did not affect our overall enjoyment of the stay but something travelers may wish to remember. Although we stayed in an Ocean Club room which was a great because of the access to the Ocean Club Lounge, this is older property. The bathrooms are smaller by current standards of newly built 4-5 star properties. Only three-piece bathroom. Tub and shower combo. The tub is also rather tiny (narrow and not a soaker tub) by any standard. I had also looked forward to having a massage at the Chi Spa but because I did not book in advance I could not be accommodated when I walked in. There was an availability an hour later which meant I have to walk back to my suite and then back again. Seems simple but the Ocean Wing is situated a good distance from where the Chi Spa is located. It was middle the middle afternoon and so it would have been a hot a tiring walk. So book yourself in advance and remember.... the Chi Spa outside of the Main Wing and Ocean Wing.

I would caution against taking a taxi or even shuttle to downtown Cebu. Big mistake. Even with a taxi, it took us over an hour to reach Ayala Mall. There was some confusion when I asked for a taxi because all we really wanted is to find a restaurant that serves lechon. So when the taxi dropped as off Ayala Mall, by then I was frustrated over the travel time, I blurted out ""Why would I want to go shopping?!"". He drove us to SM Mall where across the street was CnT Lechon. Big mistake! So bad. No fault of Shangri-La Mactan but, I had better Lechon in Antipolo where I grew up. Sorry Cebu! We just went to the wrong restaurant I guess. But seriously it was a waste of our precious vacation time to have sat in taxi through traffic.

What we really loved:
Ocean Lounge Lounge service is excellent. We skipped the breakfast here but I liked that I was able to head upstairs and have a quite time to myself with my Latte while my husband and daughter were still asleep. I was jet-lagged so kept waking up way too early.

We preferred the buffet breakfast at the pool over having it at the Tides. It just felt right eating out and enjoying the outdoor. Great buffet spread.

Cowrie Cove dinner was wonderful. Having tried the Tides buffet dinner which was OK, we wanted to try out what Shangri La can serve A la carte. We actually ordered the fresh catch fish of the day and fresh catch crab. The server brought them over for us to inspect before they were taken to the kitchen. This is beautiful restaurant with a stunning view. Nice and hip bar. Very attentive staff. I have to single out our server Katherine (Kathereen). I hope I remembered her name right. She represented the Shangri-La.

The beach/ The Marine Sanctuary.
The beach although man-made is well taken care off. We appreciate the effort of Shangri-La towards marine conservation and their interest in educating their guests on what we can do to contribute. Best snorkeling for first time snorkelers. My daughter's first attempt . We had been practicing in hotel pools but this was her first try in salt-water and with current. So many fish ! Oh wow! We were probably the first to head out in the morning to avoid the crown but even after we came back before lunch time, it didn't feel crowded at all.

I think I've written enough. So glad we squeezed in a Cebu trip and so glad we chose to stay at the Shangri-La Mactan Cebu. We would come back if our travels find us in Mactan again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"1- Double booking
Upon arrival we discovered that there had been double booking (and charging). Whilst the management recognised its error and agreed to a refund it may take up to 4 weeks. I think this is not good enough at all in this day and age when transfers are immediate.
2-use of drone
I have a small drone which I intended to use on the premises/ beach and water. Within minutes a guard came and asked for our room number indicating that it’s use is forbidden to protect the privacy of guests. In what way is a drone invading more guests privacy than screaming children or rowdy guests ? We asked to go for a limited time on the helicopter pad (there’s one! ) or on the golf course (completely empty) for a short time. The answer is negative. Thank you. But paying for see scooters is allowed of course ! Thank you.
3/ in the Ocean building. See for yourself what the view is.

"We have travelled extensively and stayed in 5-star resorts throughout Asia (Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, China, Vietnam, etc). This resort is decent. The biggest attraction is the beach. The staff is nice and friendly.
The biggest turnoff is their non-transparent and non-standard charges. Hear this:
Almost all such resorts have complimentary shuttle buses to the airport and city (if they are a bit far from the city). Here they charge for it. I was not told in advance. So better check before taking one!
We stayed in Ocean Wing which included free local phone calls. We were shocked to see they still imposed charges for local calls made to mobile phones, saying only fixed line are free.
Another issue we faced is we booked through OTA which showed “Kids upto 11yr stay free” and another place “breakfast complimentary”. But they told us kids 6 or above stay free but still need to pay 1/2 charges for breakfast.
And the most shocking was this. Even indoor kids area and almost all kids activities for kids 5+ are chargeable. We found this crazy for a resort already charging over $300/night and that too in this rainy season. No other similar resort charges.
I also founds some guests complaining that the hotel was not transparent in informing guests that one restaurant (Acqua) was closed for renovation.
Having said this, as mentioned, the staff is friendly and nice. The chefs went out of the way to provide us vegetarian dishes as menu options were limited. I just wish the policies were more reasonable and in line with properties of this standard.
Will try out a different property if and when we visit Cebu again.",Food:Value for money:Staff
We stayed here for our last two nights after two weeks in beautiful Philliphines. This was such a great ending to an amazing trip. Rooms are spacious and interiors good. The highlights for me were the private beach where you can do many activities like snorkeling while enjoying the exclusivity of this beach. The many restaurants were all excellent including the regular buffet restaurant which is possibly the best buffet breakfast I've ever had. Staff are attentive. We did not want to leave the resort which is always a great sign of a fabulous resort.,Food:Comfort & Facilities

My husband and I took 3 kids with us and restaurants by the pool was excellent food and service!

"I had just arrived at 4:00 am on a sleepy Sunday morning from a 39 hour international flight and layovers. Our family was attending a wedding there at the hotel. Months in advance we had requested early check-in based on our itinerary. The grooms family even ensured we had a conference area available to us at 8:00am to relax until our room was ready.

When I arrived via taxi from the airport, we were stopped at Security at the entry gate where the car was inspected by security and a K-9 dog. I thought that was interesting but felt a little assured they were just keeping us safe. When we pulled into the main entry I was again greeted by a security guard checking me and the car as well as another K-9 to smell everything. From there they ushered me into an x-ray booth for my bags and a metal detector to which I complained and refused.
The lobby was big and beautiful and I could already see some of the huge pool area and beauty of the surroundings as the sun rose over the ocean and resort. However, it was sweltering hot...remember we are near the equator and it is not only hot but stiflingly humid. As I approached the front desk dripping in sweat and drenching my clothes, I asked where was the air conditioning (30C+ in lobby area @4:30am). I was told that the lobby was designed as an open air concept with no windows or doors (they actually had them but they remain open always).
I was told that there was a room available for me now at another full days charge or I would need to wait for first available king room. I obviously was not going to pay another nightly rate for a few hours. I was told that the amenities would open at 6am and I was welcome to avail them with a special permit card. I was appreciative as I was tired and ready to relax in the air conditioning. They also informed me that the Conference room made available to us from the grooms party would be open at 8am. I then paid for the room reservation and repeated my options, amenities 6-8, conference room 8-?? whenever first available room.
I went and changed clothes, found a couch, some coffee and enjoyed the sweltering sunrise over the resort. The grounds are simply gorgeous, their horticulture department and staff deserve awards for their attention to detail. 6am arrived and I moved down to the pool and hung out awaiting my family to arrive. Family arrived at 7:45am. 8:15am went to conference area to relax but it was not open. Asked several employees why the room was not open and got no response. I yelled at one of them to go get a manager. Hopeless, I Trekked back upstairs to front desk to ask why the room was not open. They did not have an answer but assured me it would be open before I returned there...of course it was not. We finally got in (there are 2 adults, 2 children 3&4 a sister and a helper) about 8:45am.

The kids absolutely loved the kids water park and all the other things kids there. I was actually having a blast just watching my kids enjoy themselves. We discussed coming back for a family stay-cation to enjoy the kids things more. Around 11am I started inquiring back at the front desk where we were in priority on a room as I had seen 5-6 coaches flll up and exit before 8am. I was told there was no room available and I got upset and asked for management. Evidently during shift change, all the promises I was made left with the employee that told me. We finally entered a room in the old wing about 11:30am. The thermostat was set to 18C and we left to go eat lunch. When we arrived back at the room, the room temp was stifling hot, still at 29C+. We had a flower girl, a singer and 3 others trying to get ready for a wedding in a room at 29C - ugg. I called and complained, they sent someone up to ensure we knew how to run an air conditioner and that the windows weren't open (I assured them windows were closed and I knew how to operate the air but...). After another hour I DEMANDED another room. Within 30 minutes they moved us to a room that cooled down so quickly the girls were cold already but still the temp was only at 26C.

The wedding ceremony and reception were wonderful, amazing food and again the resort grounds. I know why this is the most popular wedding destination in Cebu now :) Upon arriving back at the new room at 9:30 pm the room was again stifling hot, back to 29C, it cooled down slightly over the next hour but really never below 26/27C. I knew the building was on a chiller so this wasn't a room specific problem as well, the hotel should have already known about the issue and taken corrective action. The front desk sent me a portable fan to try and ease the temp but I ended up sweating all night long in bed and got hardly any sleep at all.
We ate breakfast at Tides and the buffet was impressive...something for all including a kids size buffet with all their favorites. We enjoyed the rest of the morning playing with the kids at the water park and the ocean and thoroughly enjoyed the time. We then ate lunch at Aqua and were impressed with the variety and quality of the pricey food.
Overall we were not happy with our stay despite the grounds and play time with the kids due to the uncomfortable room. At check-out I was going to complain but before I could request a manager to speak with a Manager arrived sincerely apologizing for the issue with the air conditioning. They assured us that when all guest checked out of that floor/wing they would be looking deeper into the issue (I still contend they had known for some time yet not addressed the issue for some reason hoping people would not notice) In addition, they decided to comp our room for the trouble. I typically would not take charity and just blog but in this case I did as the room was not cheap at all. If you follow my reviews, we don't expect perfection but are looking for a swift, meaningful recovery when things do go wrong. I have to say that the recovery was 5 star, swift and meaningful...and appreciated.
Based on our overall experience I still rated a 4 would have been a 4.5 if TripAdvisor had it but just short of the 5 for the room air conditioning issues.
Some quick tips for the hotel to improve overall customer satisfaction:
1 Security- Profile your guests and understand the fine line between making your guests feel safe and making them feel like the terrorists.
2 Site- Trash cans needed everywhere (this is a Philippine issue not just here) during the entire stay I only saw one trash can. Although there may be more they were not noticeable. People need a place to put their trash to keep your resort beautiful.
3 Lobby- Apportion part of the lobby to be air-conditioned. Any 30C+ area is uncomfortable and whatever beauty you have is lost on the guests discomfort
4 Kids- indoor play area required kids to wear long pants and long sleeve shirt to play. Remember we are near the equator and the temps are 30-35C with 90% humidity. I think this requirement is short-sighted and although geared at kids safety prevent many kids and families from enjoying because they didnt bring long sleeves to the equator.
5 Rooms/Common areas- Your furniture is falling apart, looks bad and some of it stinks or smells from being outdoors in the humidity for years. Its outdated and in need of a makeover. Although not familiar with the Shangri-La brand and not knowing if they are always choose traditional Design...it could use some more modern/contemporary Design elements. The rooms were nothing special at all and I would not even give the room by itself (without the air-con problem) more than a 2.5 star review. The RESORT saved the room as it was not good.

"We are a regular guest in this hotel, where we always book a room in the Ocean Club.
We have the feeling that the noise has increased lately. Everywhere you go, there is music or TVs. There is no more a quite place, where you can relax. This needs getting used for a guest who is looking for tranquility.

"We arrived at Shangrila after a long 5hr drive from Oslob....quite knackered. At checkin there was some issue with our Agoda booking, but the checkin lady checked with her manager and they graciously said that they will honor what I believed we'd booked and deal with Agoda themselves. Whilst the initial start of this stay was a bit stressful...every single moment after this was just pure unadulterated bliss! From the massive room to the breathtaking beach and marine life, to every single staff members genuine service skills....we have left this place determined to return soon!

I've had many beach resort holidays and usually spend most of my time at the pool....this place was the first time ever I spent every day at the beach in the water. The water is so clear, and the marine life just off the beach is unreal! Highly recommend the amazing snorkeling tour at 1pm every day....so informative and fascinating! And wonderful to see the incredible efforts to preserve the marine reserve.

We also loved finding NZ Natural ice cream...given we are kiwis, it was a delight to have hokeypokey in Philippines!

All in all, I just don't have enough superlatives to describe how much we loved this place, and the beach alone and marine life within it is enough to put this place right at the top of our faves! Yes it is expensive but worth every peso!

The kids’ club is well organized & our kids love it. Bring socks & long sleeves (jacket or tee). They charge a small fee which is really worth it.

"Last week's visit was spent with my sisters who were here for a short vacation from Manila and Singapore. Part of the itinerary was to go to the beach and I could not think and anything better than Shangri-la and so here were again.It is always best to stay in a resort where we feel welcome, it just make things easy, comfortable and worry free. As usual the 5 star service is very consistent from the lobby entrance to the beach.
- I would like to say thank you for Eric for giving my sister a very nice hair and make-up service and I apologize for coming late for the appointment.
-Ernie at the beach was very alert in making sure kids at the beach were safe, I noticed he called the attention of one parent whose child was left at the shore alone. ---March and Richard at the Breeze Bar was so accommodating, in spite of the hot weather they still manage to smile and make sure they attended to my needs, I love it when they call me with my first name :).
-Shai, Julie and Jenny were very helpful as well during reservation and registration. The calamansi welcome drinks were very refreshing.
-Venessa Verallo was very attentive, she made sure good safety for beach goers, pulled out a damaged wooden board with visible rusty screw at the beach.
-Darren at Tides was very friendly to my kids, breakfast is always fun at Tides.

"We stayed from Jun 18-22, 2018.From the airport you can take a shuttle to Shangrila depending on your reservation you might have to pay 200 pesos each, if you have ocean view it’s already included in your reservation. Staff were always courteous nice and always smiling it seems that they really enjoyed what they do. While waiting to be check in calamansi juice was offered multiple times really a nice touch. We have to wait for 1 1/2 hrs for the keys to our room since the check in time is at 2 pm people in the front desk gave us a list of restaurants within shangrila. Once checked in our room was spacious with 2 bottled water for free and of course coffee and tea. For bfast we like the “Tide” since it has variety to choose from compare to Aquos. Staff always nice respectful and will assist you if you need help. Overall our stay was an experience that will never forget except pricey on the food like 1 buko for 250 pesos, the day before outside the hotel we got buko for 25 pesos. You have to take a taxi each time you want to go out or rent their van, but they provide a shuttle to the SM mall or Ayala for a minimum fee 150 pesos ? Next time we would stick to a hotel in Cebu easier to get around with public transportation. I love staying in Shangrila but it’s too far to all tourist spot.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"This should easily be a 4 out of 5 rating - it does not deserve a 5. The good - the grounds are well kept and the staff are super friendly. The bad - prices for kids meals in the buffet over 11 they pay adult prices - I noticed no one in the reviews talks prices well for my 14 year old to go to the buffet for dinner it was just over $45 USD, my 10 year old was half price $22.50 and I had a al carte for $13.50. To put in perspective the three of us ate at an Italian restaurant in Resorts world in Manila and had a caesar salad, two past dishes, one pizza, two soft drinks, chocolate milk shake and two pieces of cake for $42, well not cheap it certainly shows how much they overcharge for meals! I booked a regular room originally and asked to be upgraded to an ocean wing room, which they said was not available for the dates, I had booked and I asked them to put me on a wait list. Once at the hotel the Ocean wing was available and the extra charge of approx $30 USD per night seemed reasonable, However, the ocean wing outside bar is under construction (noise) and the ocean wing pool is mainly in the shade in the afternoon. I also was informed that I was not allowed to go to the lounge because I did not get a premium room??? This was never explained to me! So why did I pay the extra $30 a night??? You will also be asked to sign waivers for all activities EACH DAY for your kids! It seems you can't sign a blanket one or one that covers the length of your stay - so be prepared to have to go and sign each day for each activity - oh and you will pay extra for this as well. The resort & rooms are dated and showing their age, pool is in just ok shape, grout on the tiles is missing in a lot of areas AND kids over 11 cannot use the slide for some reason, I even offered to sign a waiver!!! There is really not much in the area outside the resort - a few restaurants so if you are thinking that you will be able to easily walk out and get supplies or other restaurant choices - this will not be the case. You are for all practical purposes on a land based cruise ship! There is no overall orientation brochure that tells you what restaurants are on site when they open and what type of food they serve. The hotel is close to the airport which is good, but I would not come back to this area as there are many other options in the Philippines that allow one not to be holed up strictly in the hotel! Beach area is nice although man made and the sand I heard is from Boracay. Also keep in mind that here are many families with very young children so restaurants will be busy and noisy for the most part.",Food:Value for money:Location
"Having been in Shangri-La Mactan from 2002 to 2004, it was wonderful to return after 14 year lapse and see how the Resort has developed.

From the moment you arrive at the entrance, the Gardens are immaculately maintained, beautiful matured with lots of shade, deck chairs and staff willing to assist. Chi The Spa, Wow what a sanctuary, tried to book a treatment however same was booked up, ( a good sign ) so book early !

Had Dinner in the “Cowrie Cove”, Jenny and her team did an exceptional job. We were a group of 8 persons, asked Jenny to select for us fresh seafood and could not fault same. Also the setting is unmatched, overlooking the waters.

Lunch in “Aqua”, Ocean Wing, a group of 12 pax, service was perfect and similarly, the food was divine. Did not make it to “ Tea of Spring” due to time constraint, however Joemarie, was actively promoting his outlet , which was very busy.

Breakfast, can be busy in All Day Dinning, so for quieter option, go to Aqua.

From Mactan, I was scheduled to travel to 5 Star Luxury Resort in Palawan. On the night prior to my departure, I was told via email that due to unpredictable weather, boats could not travel and I would have to find alternative accommodation. No offer of assistance from the 5 Star Luxury Hotel in Palawan, in spite of paying high Rates, which had been fully pre paid. Was told I could fly back at another stage and within the period of one year at the prevailing rates, also black out dates, otherwise I would lose all payment for my two nights booking. I had to make numerous phone calls to the Hotel and eventually they agreed to a refund, but told I will have to wait for one month for same.

Naturally, I was at a loss as was checking out the following morning. Went to Front Office in Shangri-La’s Mactan Resort, and met with Chris, whom went over and beyond the call of duty. He immediately started searching for suitable Hotel and made phone calls to check on availability and came back to me with various options.

"When you book a Shangri-La Hotel, you pretty much know what to expect. Service is exceptional especially at the buffet breakfast restaurant, where they were extra attentive to our family's needs and requests.

I would prefer, though, if they had an indoor park for the kids, that we didnt have to pay for. We went in May and there was a day that it was raining and too cold to go out or have a swim. The only available indoor play area for my kids was the Adventure Zone which they charged you for, even if you are a hotel guest. My kids are 6 and 2 years old and the only play area that was free was for infants--had a small slide and small ballpit. I dont remember that being the case in other Shangri-Las abroad though.

So on a cold and rainy day when you cant use the pools or the outdoor playgrounds, a hotel like Mactan Shangri-La should provide alternatives for hotel guests lest they stay the whole day in their hotel room and waste a ""holiday"".",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"My sister invited us to join them for an R&R in Shangri-la Mactan last April 2018. We took the shuttle from the airport. We had a room in Ocean View area. When we arrived, we had mangoes, courtesy of the hotel, the mangoes were sooooo good. We had a super duper huge bed. The toilet was nice and clean. The beach was amazing, very clear. My sister swam with a school of fish. My son enjoyed swimming too. I just enjoyed looking at the view, the tranquil sea, the fine sand. My son enjoyed his breakfast - they had bacon, its his favorite. I want to go back and stay more nights. Thank you Shangri-la Mactan for a beautiful experience.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"The hotel is ideal for families. It has everything needed to make it a paradise for kids. There are various pools, for all ages, water fountains, water slides, many activities each day, like kids movie, fish feeding, etc. Additionally there are indoor playgrounds. The staff is great, very helpful and attentive. The food in the restaurants is quite good with many different options, like local, Italian, fish, steak, etc. There is also a bar for evenings drinks. The breakfast buffet has endless options. The beach is private and really very nice. The rooms are quite spacious and very clean. Definitely recommend it and we will come back for sure!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Visited this resort 3 years ago and enjoyed it returned same time of year but totally different experience.

1 prices in the hotel have risen sharply in the last 3 years
2 had dinner at tides buffet 2500 peso choice was limited
3 service at Cowrie Cove bar was awful not enough staff and very slow service
4 breakfast buffet at tides is not enjoyable due to amount of people we ate at the overspill in the Chinese had to go into tides to get our food due to limited selection
5 were told we could not use the Ocean Wing pool as it was now exclusive to this part of the resort what after paying £250 per night

Overall the resort is still off a high standard with excellent general staff in the resort and great room/service

On the second day we had breakfast at ocean wing (which is allowed) this as much better and enjoyable

Just not as good as 3 years ago",Food:Value for money
"I stayed here for a company conference. This hotel has a good ambiance of a resort. It has complete facilities (gym, tennis courts, and spa). The area is huge and has 2 pools and beach fronts. they also have ballrooms, function rooms and a tent for big events.The hallway carpet needs to be replaced.",Comfort & Facilities
"The resort itself is nice and has lots of facilities for children. However, the whole time we were there we were never able to get a chair by the pool or on the beach (why couldn’t the resort provide more seating). We also had to wait in line for breakfast and super long lines to check in and out or to ask questions at the information desk. Trying to call from the room I was also put on hold to the point that I hung up. Even catching the shuttle back to the airport we waited in line to board the shuttle and then when we arrived were told that our suitcases were not aboard the bus and would have to wait for those too.

Other than the long waits, the resort has a good reef /marine sanctuary right in front with snorkeling access. The rooms were clean and the staff were pleasant.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I chose to book at Shangri-la's Mactan Resort and Spa primarily because of its Marine Sanctuary. I was pleasantly surprised to discover it would also be a sanctuary for me and a shangrila in its real sense. Booking is hassle-free, all questions and concerns are promptly and patiently answered. Airport pick - up is efficient, check-in is a breeze. The five days went hassle-free and worry-free. We felt so important and special. Snorkeling at the marine sanctuary is truly a unique experience. They protect not just the marine life but also the lives of the people who snorkel...lifeguards are everywhere. Fish feeding is an amazing experience. As to the accommodations,well, you can not ask for more...it is worth every single hard earned peso for this once (maybe twice, thrice...) in a lifetime vacation. Will definitely return.
I went home with all the joy my heart can contain. Thank you Shangri-la",Staff:Food
"I stayed at the hotel for 6 nights with my dad and uncle. We booked the Ocean Wing room. Everything was wonderful. The staff, the food, the service. The beaches were very clean and the water was perfect for snorkeling. If you spend the extra money, book the Ocean wing. Staying in this section gets you more options for breakfast in the morning and complimentary cocktail hours in the lounge with some snacks.
Definitely go to Cowrie Cove for drinks - Klerk is a fantastic bartender who makes wonderful drinks and jokes.
The spa was fantastic as well, I got a 90 minute aromatherapy massage.
During our trip, we went to 3 other hotels in the area to see them and check out their beach bars. All the other hotels don't compare to the Shangri- La.We were very happy with our choice to stay at the Shangri-La.",Food:Location:Staff

"Its been more than 15 years since I have been to this hotel for a stay. It has improved a lot. It's a very child-friendly resort with lots of activities for all ages. Food is good. We enjoyed the breakfast feast each morning. Resort facilities, especially those that on the beachside including water sports, was superb, everything can be arranged within reach and service is good. Once can rent some aqua shoes, masks, floaters at affordable prices so you don't really have to buy or bring if you're not a pro and intend to use it for a short time. The rooms are large enough for 2 adults and 2 kids. Those with a veranda facing the pool/beach is superb. The downside is the check out that takes ages. All other services were great.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"So if you are looking for a quiet times or adults only areas, you will be disappointed, but for families with kids, this is a great hotel. Beach closes early, often not enough sunbeds for all the guests around pools or on the beach, definitely lack of sunbrellas. Most of sunbeds are arranged in 4 under one sunbrella, you can rarely have some privacy as a couple. Food was good, room service as well. Room fridge was not replenished daily. Comparing to some other luxury hotels, this is more kind of 4.5 star hotel it really misses just a little bit more!",Comfort & Facilities
"First and foremost I want to say WOW! Couldn’t have been happier with this stay. Hotel staff were amazing and unbelievably friendly. I have never experienced such great customer service anywhere in my 30 years of traveling. 5 Star experience from start to finish. We stayed 3 nights in Panorama Ocean Wing room. Room overlooks ocean with great views of beach and Ocean Wing pool. Room was large, clean and comfortable with all standard amenities in room such as safe and mini fridge. Laundry services available. Resort is very large in size with several pools, shopping and great dining options. Many activities available. Miniature golf, batting cage, walking pathways, every kind of water activities you can think of. Marine sanctuary. Hotel has an evening outdoor buffet with show several nights a week. Resort offers so much there is really no need to leave. Resort offers complimentary shuttles to airport every hour on the half hour as well as 3 shuttles a day to shopping mall area.

"we had high expectations and did feel let down. On the night we arrived we needed to move as the noise from the generators was so loud we were then shown 4 different rooms that night which didn't go down great as we had been travelling for 15 hours. There are two sides to this hotel one which is noisy loud and constantly has queues at reception and the Ocean View side which is where we were moved to the next morning this was much much better. This is where you need to stay , you have access to your own reception , your own breakfast are which is quieter and your own quiet pool area. You also have complimentary shuttle service to the airport The service is great, the beech could do with more umbrellas.
Also there isn't much to do in the evening and no where to go out. The gym is very good standard. The buffet restaurant is very expensive we preferred the Chinese restaurant that has variety. I found it to be expensive due to poor location and value for money.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I have been frequenting this hotel for my short getaways with my family. This is the first trip without the kids. Service is consistent the hotel is a short 15 minute car ride from the airport.

Ocean rooms are a must offering a fantastic view. Clean and well equipped. WIFI on the beach has improved so if you need to stay connected yet want to chill at the beach you can do so.

The resort is a great escape with nicely appointed cabanas on the beach. The service is great with Albino and Benji at the beach engaging guest and ensuring your always with a drink.

Tides breakfast offering is vast and I love how I can have ice cream for breakfast! The hotel grounds are well kept a and cleanliness is amazing. The Chi spa offering is great and highly recommend the 3 hour spa treatment.

The marine life is great having been here 20 years ago the hotel had no marine life but have done so much in recreating a marine reserve. If you are a triathlete then just reach out to the Life Girard who regularly train. A great work out . Recommend an early morning swim at 6am as the marine life is amazing. The bigger fish tend to leave later on in the day as the boats and channel get busier.

This is by far my favourite getaway. Not because of the rooms , bed. The people and staff make this resort my second home.

Special recognition to albino, Benji, Marvin at the beach. Teresa, Roslyn at Tides. Rochelle at the spa. Jessie at the kids club who recently move from the beach and my kids favourite member of staff. Kids club if you have kids is great with many offerings of activities.

"We stayed for 5 nights in this resort. I will start with the the resort is vast..wait till go outside and see the grounds. The hotel designs and furnishings is as expected from Shangri-la is gorgeous though you can't deny that it's showing its age. Nevertheless it is still a beautiful resort. On the rooms, we booked for the Ocean Club,(my husband loves Clubs). Now the best part I really liked was the service. When the shuttle bus arrived, a staff meet us at the entrance and directly guided us so we can go directly to us room. Wed did not queue and waited for us to be checked in. I think they did an in room check in. When we arrived at the room there was a a basket of fruits( including those mangoes) which my daughter really liked.The room was good just the same with other Shangri-La hotels. All was good. When we outside we did see the vast grounds, there were activities for kids i the kids club and there are schedule for each activity. My daughter loved it!..They have free sessions and have paid sessions it depends on which you want to attend. They also have this playground for for those kids that wants more action.They have 2 Playground which is nice, one for those little babies and toddlers and the other was for bigger kids.My daughter really enjoyed the Kids Club. Now I want to discuss the food. We tried 3 different restaurants(Tides, Tea of Spring,Acqua) there and I cannot say less.. all those were definitely delicious and the service was really great. Each time we went in to the restaurants the staff/manager greeted us warmly and took care of us. The staffs in the tea of Spring were really memorable since my daughter were really fond of them. Those girls really made her day, their name until now she won't forget Elizabeth and Angeline). The Tides, their buffet has lots to offer, high quality and warm people. The managers were all warm and friendly. The Acqua,offers a really authentic Italian food. Now I will review the beach, the beach is nice though compared to Shangri-la Boracay the latter was really pristine and beautiful. But they the beach in Mactan has fish sanctuary where you can have encounter or see the colorful fishes while you are swimming. Even the staff on the beachfron were really service oriented. Our stay was definitely unforgettable.We were spoiled!If I were to come back its because of the great service.",Staff:Food

"We stayed in an Ocean Wing room in Shangri-la which included club access.

Room - despite being an older property, the rooms are relatively well maintained, clean and comfortable.

Resort - this is a really family friendly resort. They had lots of indoor and outdoor activities for all ages. Big indoor playground for the little ones, arcade with billiard tables for the older kids (and adults) outdoor water play area, mini golf, table tennis, boxing, the list goes on... In our case, we're a couple with no kids and still had loads to of activities to entertain.

There are several pools. Guests in the Ocean Wing have one pool exclusive to them.

Beach & water - beach is white sand. Water is fantastic. There's a house reef with excellent snorkeling / diving right from the shore. Lots of corals and fish.

Lounge - there are two sets in the evening. An earlier set of 4pm -6pm which caters more to families, though alcohol is till served, and a later set (6.30pm) for adults only.

Food is decent, staff is friendly. You never have to leave the resort for the duration of your trip. Highly recommend.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"We have gone for many years with family back to this hotel because of the beautiful location, super-friendly staff and the ease of getting there from Hong Kong - and it has never failed to deliver a very enjoyable and relaxing experience, especially for a family with kids. We noticed the hotel food however is not where it was before . The Italian restaurant is now more run of the mill and less of an adult like menu/ atmosphere. It used to be a great get away from the hustle and bustle of the main coffee shop. Cowrie Cove is also a fabulous setting - right on the water with fresh seafood and a nice bar for sunset hours. It would really do with a more contemporary and tasty menu. Dishes were bland at best . The family coffee shop has been spruced up and is surprisingly tasty and enjoyable now. Well done on the renovations there and the varied Asian dishes. Overall hotel staff service was excellent. Facilities- we love the two pool option. Little kids tend to stay up by the waterslide pool while adults with grown kids or alone can enjoy the lower pool. Shangrila is the only hotel with a nice sandy man made beach. Worth the booking since it offers activities for everyone. Don't forget to have a fresh mango smoothie after your jellyfish sting....",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We stayed for 5 days this Febuary. Our main reason for picking the hotel were the extensive facilities on offer and the promise of a teen club. Which was completely misleading. There was no teen club. Our teenage kids were bored senseless. For young children however it seems as if they cater very well.
Here are postiives/negatives

Positives
- Staff very friendly (but having to work in a system that does not encourage peaceful holiday making)
- beautiful waters with tropical fish
- Rooms are clean and perfectly adequate (especially those with sea view)
- Facilities are great (but absolutely everything is extra cost...to point of ridiculous) - mini golf, pitch putt, boxing classes, billiards, arcades, spa, ping pong etc....
- Dive school is large and well equipped

Negatives
- Totally over-crowded given the space and facilities
- Caters almost entirely to Chinese/Korean markets
- There is no teenage club. The facilities are good but you have to pay for everything. They have lovely billiard tables but you have to hire them for 30mins/60mins. They have arcades/Xbox/computers etc.... all of which you have to hire. Nothing is part of any complimentary club activity
- The restaurants are OK - nothing great. There is a dim sum one that we enjoyed and an Italian one which was a 6/10. however, the seafood restaurant was terrible and seemed mainly to offer defrosted fish rather than fresh seafood.
- The sunloungers had no cushions on them. Only the wicker base. (unless you were staying in the even more expensive Ocean club suites and then you get to use a pool with sunloungers that had their cushions on.

All in all i expect much much more from a reportedly 5 star resort. It was over-crowded, breakfast felt like a fight for a seat every morning and you couild hardly pick up a toilet paper without the hotel charging you an exra.

"I was vacation with my family and visited this resort in Mactan, Cebu. When you walk in, this place is absolutely gorgeous. No doubt about it. Everyone is very welcoming and has amazing customer service.

We booked a suite and we were kind of surprised by the room. It was pretty small and it was 2 queen beds pushed together. The balcony was also small but the view was nice.
The room itself was difficult to have room service even though they had the tables that broke down for space.

The kids are where the pools are we’re nice. But it was very full with a lot of people when we went. And the pool area wasn’t cleaned up. We sat in an area that had trash and left over drinks from the previous people. We also couldn’t find anyone so we could place an order. There were menus, but we didn’t know where to go or who to talk to, to place an order.

The view was nice. The landscaping is really beautiful. Overall, this is a nice looking resort. But for the money we paid for our room, it was disappointing. I was expecting something a little more. But, I’m glad I got to experience it at least once. (Needs to be updated a little more) food was great also!",Comfort & Facilities
"It's hilarious reading the reviews. Almost all of the complaints are exactly the same ones I've had since my stay a few years back. The is room never ready, long check out, lousy food, unfriendly and rude staff, noise and construction. I was in the middle of a shower one morning and the water stopped and brown slime started coming out of the shower head all over me. I was HORRIFIED! Put a robe on and went down to the lobby and they made me wait for 3 hours before anyone came up to look at it. Never offered an apology or to change my room. The manager thanks you for your feedback but nothing ever changes. Anytime anyone ask me where to stay in the Philippines I always reply, anywhere but here. The worst ever!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed in the Ocean Wing and had a large suite which was well appointed and maintained but the carpet in the hall was stained beyond belief.

Generally this is a very good large resort hotel with two large pools and a nice beach with a reef just off of it with plenty of marine life. The staff generally are very well trained and I would particularly compliment the beach staff who were knowledgeable and helpful (I saw one giving very good first aid when a guest was bitten by a Trigger Fish).

However there were a few drawbacks. The room one day was still not cleaned at 4pm, Cowrie Cove had run out of fresh fish in the tanks by 8.30pm, the make a charge to take their shuttle into Cebu. The breakfast is ok but not up to the standards at other Shangri-La hotels I have stayed at.

The position is ok but there is very little around it and it can take over an hour to get into Cebu through the traffic.

When we were there the vast majority of other guests were from Japan/Korea.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Staying in Manila, is a usual activity for me. Travelling for both business and pleasure this has been my frame of reference when it comes to the Philippines. People keep telling me, 'You need to see Cebu, you need to see Palawan or Boracay. So for my birthday this year after doing a bit of business travel in Manila I jumped on a short plan ride with my girlfriend and booked a hotel in Cebu. In Manila I was already staying at the Edsa Shang and I had some points in my golden circle account so I booked a few nights in the Mactan Resort expecting the same kind of level. To be honest I had no idea what to expect from surroundings. I imagined we would be in a swanky hotel maybe a short drive from the coast. I was so wrong. Once I got off the plane and in to the little bus, we drove through what looks like a little town and I was like. Ok this place is not what I expected. If you have ever been to one of the mainland provinces you will know what I mean. I was like 'OH'. It only took like 10/15 minutes and we got to the hotel and were smartly dropped off at the ocean wing reception which is not the main reception and a short walk from the main part of the hotel. We went in a little ahead of our check in time and they gave us a room with a panoramic title. We walked down the hall and opened the door to the bedroom and we both just froze. The view from the bedroom was better than I have ever seen. I took a picture and have included it. WOW, I mean you have the pool, Exclusive to golden circle members by the way, and then the beach right there. I could see the sea, so close and the beach look sensational. After totting around the room taking photos and videos we ordered some room service and ate on the balcony. We then left the room and headed out of the rear doors of the reception area where you have the pool down to your left and the main pools and main hotel to the right. We followed the signs for the beach. Down a little hill and you approach the beach bar. There are a couple of huts and plenty of shaded beds and cabanas. We plonked ourselves on a couple of beds exchanged our towel cards for some towels. 4 given and laid out for us by an attendant and as I was judging the distance back to the bar someone with a menu and a smile arrived at the sunbeds and took our order for us. We sat for a while just basking in the wonder of the place until I heard someone talking about fish food, I turned my head and saw one of the beach attendants handing out bottles of fish food. I wandered over and grabbed a bottle and then waded out into the warm clear waters and began tossing little balls of food into the water. Within seconds I was surrounded by the most beautiful carnival school of fish in a circle around me. It was thrilling. I wanted more. I saw a sign on the wooden hut announcing that there was a free snorkelling safari trip daily, and checking that it didn’t collide with the by one take one cocktail happy hour schedule I signed up. The guide handed out life jackets, snorkels, flippers and masks and after a short intel session pointing out the main types of fish and coral in the area on coloured boards inside the hut, myself and my motley group of tourists, some Japanese, some European, converged on the shoreline and once instructed how to use the snorkels and flippers we splashed out into the deeper water. The session saw us route around the jetty’s placed just off shore and back round the rock island. Not far I guess around 200/300 meters so swimming is essential here. My girlfriend not being a strong swimmer but an excellent floater was left on the shoreline for this reason. There were plenty of breaks and they take it easy on you to ensure its safe. There is a lifeguard stationed about half way between the shore and the jetty so you never need to worry. We touched blue sea stars (not star fish) we are told and were taken above the four giant clams which were impressive. Again fish food was handed out and it was a great experience. So good I did it the following day again. We ate French fries on the beach once I returned after about an hour and then at sunset headed to the bar for some half price cocktail action. We changed and headed to the main part of the hotel and ate in the lobby on our first night. This little comfortable area allows you a look at the live band and we had a nice bottle of wine (Australian White) and fish and chips to eat. It was delicious. Prices were reasonable. The next morning with breakfast included in our room rate we headed to Tides, the international restaurant which offers a huge buffet style service with everything you would expect and a lot you wouldn’t. I particularly enjoyed the wheatgrass smoothie counter and of course the English breakfast section. We sat outside and looked about the grounds as we ate. It was heaven. Being my birthday I had to endure an embarrassing birthday cake and potential sing at during breakfast which was organised by my girlfriend. Very cute if not utterly mortifying. We had organised a parasailing experience which took place after breakfast so we headed down to the beach and the water sports hut. Ushered on to a boat we were taken out to see and strapped into our harness and the pair of us were hooked on to a metal bar which were asked to hold. Standing at the rear of the boat holding onto this bar with a parachute trailing in the water behind us we were ready to go. If anyone is wondering what parasailing entails it is just this. The boat picks up speed again and the parachute catches on the air and basically so do we. In moments we 100 feet into the air and rising. There are three height levels and we enjoyed the lowest which was still 500ft and at this height you simply relax and enjoy the view. It’s a breath-taking was to see the coastline and a great bit of water sports for those never having done anything like this before. The boat goes about for a bit and then we start to descend. Back on board we headed back to the shore and took in the beach again. At lunch time we ate at the ocean wing pool and the Italian al a carte restaurant Aqua which is attached and allows you to eat pool side. I had a risotto and we had some amazing focaccia and balsamic. We headed round to the main pool after eating and found a little ice cream parlour and hung out for a bit there before heading back to the beach bar at sunset. We ate that night at the Italian and had a lovely Italian wine and some seriously good pasta and pizza. Before heading back to Manila the next day I picked up a few souvenirs from the shop in the main hotel reception area. Not too expensive. We flew out in the evening and the hotel were happy to arrange a later checkout at a small cost. The staff here were exemplary. As expected by all Shang hotels. This place is nothing short of amazing. I almost don’t want to tell everyone how good it is so it’s not fully booked next time I want to return, which is soon. Go there. You will agree its a paradise.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I stayed here with my wife after we spent 4 days at a hotel in Boracay. As we drove up to the Shangri-La hotel from the airport I thought this place sure is different from the last place we stayed. There, everything was along the beach; shops, food, activities. Here, we were in a self contained resort. I felt trapped! My impression was it wasn't going to be as good as Boracy. But I would be proved wrong within the very first hour we were there!

Let's start with the room view. I looked at the rates and I knew I did not want to pay extra to be in the Ocean Wing just so I could look at the ocean from my room.Yes, it is closer to the ocean, but the walk is short from the Main Wing where our room was. I'm here to enjoy the surf not look at it from my room. But if you really want a view, you can have it for extra money. Also, the ocean wing has it's own pool, The room we did have overlooked the front of the hotel and the beautiful landscaping. We also had a patio with seating, but we didn't use it. Room was spacious and the bathroom was beautiful. It had both a large tub and a separate stand up shower. The toilet had a built-in bidet too.

The food at Shangri-La is first rate! You can't go wrong at any of the restaurants at the hotel! Breakfast is included in the price and it is a feast to behold. The Tides is one of two restaurants here that serve breakfast.There was breakfast food from all parts of the world here - at least five different countries are included, all prepared authentically. There is also as smaller version of this breakfast fare offered at Aqua, another restaurant at the hotel. We preferred this place, as there was much less hustle and bustle (laid back) compared to Tides. At night, Acqua is an Italian restaurant and the food here was splendid!! The chief is from Italy and every dish we had was incredible. The artisan pizza is handmade from scratch, including the dough. All the bread is fresh baked. You must try Acqua. Try the Tides for their splendid dinner buffet. Great seafood at Cowrie Cove too.
The prices at all the restaurants were good, we don't drink so our bill would be lower than most. But considering you are at a resort (with great food) I would consider them moderate priced

There are plenty of activities here too. There are game rooms, pool tables and more. There is a Spa but we did not use it. The resort has many hectares of forest and beautiful gardens. There are walking trails all over the property. The long beach front is immaculate, many shaded lounge areas with recliners and chairs. Food and drink is available right on the beach. There is a nature center which offers guided tours. There is daily fish feedings and guided snorkel tours. Let me mention that the waters around the beach is a marine preserve and is a protected area. There are corals and plenty of fish which swim very close to shore, so even children can see and feed the fish while standing in the water. You can rent snorkel equipment right at the beach, but here is a tip The nature center has a daily snorkel tour around the reef and they provide all the equipment (fins, snorkel, mask and float vest) for Free! The tour is about 40 minutes and you follow a guide who takes you all around. You also get to feed the fish out there in the water. So if 40 minutes is enough to see things (it was for me) save your money and don't rent equipment. Take the free tour. And you can do it everyday if you want! Don't forget the free fish feeding too. The fish come right to the shore. If you are into SCUBA, they have that here too but there is a fee.

There are separate swimming pools for small children and another for swimmers. Beautiful landscaping around the pool where you have your lounges and chairs.. Towels are very lush and are free.

There are things to see and do out of the hotel grounds too. They have a daily shuttle bus that leaves in the morning from the hotel and goes off Mactan Island to the different malls. The cost is 300 pesos each way, (per group, not per person). It makes the return trip in the late afternoon. I should mention the the traffic here is some of the worst I've seen. The morning trip is relatively quick 45 minutes, but the return trip can easily take an hour and a half or more so be prepared!!

In summary, I had a great time here and would come back. The people who work here are some of the nicest I've met. They are happy and super attentive to the guests. They make you feel at home and special. It is a truly a world class resort!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

The breakfast and dinner buffet at Tides Rte. is good,many choices from different countries including LECHÓN, speciality from Cebu.
Diferents pools with diferents áreas for diferentes ages groups. ( I really liked the lifeguards, they are many of them and they are alert ).
Beach is beautiful, and clean, again the staff very friendly and helpful.
Bus to the biggest shopping malls they are available from the hotel, book in advance is needed.
Lots of things you can do if you want or just relax.
Is true that is very busy hotel, but if you choose wisely timing for you breakfast and dinner, you won’t feel it.

We really liked it!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

The staff are the most delightful and helpful people that you will ever meet always with a smile on their faces.

The resort is great for families with so much to do for kids and plenty of place to dine.

The beach is awesome and the fish feeding is a lot of fun for kids.

The resorts ECO TOURISM drive is really commendable and it is visible that they are doing their part for the local environment.",Staff:Location
"We been here many times and always our journeys are amazing. Nice ocean room with club lounge access, staff are lovely like the pool, spa and beach. Just change and improve the security check point before to get in. The dog is skinny and seems not good enough to check the new customers and car when are coming in. Apart of that nothing to complain.

"Thoroughly enjoyed the stay at Family Room at main wing with 2 queen beds. Room facing pool and ocean. A little noisy when breakfast crowd came as Tides restaurant was right below us although we stayed on the 8th floor. It was a peak period so the resort was crowded but service by staff was superb. Security top notch with K9 team at resort entrance. Kids friendly resort with indoor playground and full day of activities. Adults may join yoga, tennis, circuit training and other activities daily too. City shuttle provided by resort at a nominal fee to local shopping malls but remember to book in advance with concierge. Our family loved the private beach as water was clean and fishes swam right to the shore. Weather was sunny for a few days and rained for a full day and beach was off limit with red flag when we were there. As there were many Korean tourists in Cebu, there were many Korean restaurants and spas. A great place to have holiday indeed!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
Wonderful place that I've been coming to as a visitor for 5 years. More recently have been a resort member and must say that you won't find a better place guest services wise from a western perspective.,Staff
"This property is “ideal” for family vacations or leisure travelers because :

1. Buffet breakfast is elaborate and there is a specific kids section. They have Korean , Filipino , noodle bar , international , Asian , Chinese ...list can go on ...the service team at tides is splendid ...in my opinion they have mastered how to handle a extremely busy operation with a smile ...each day the manager would come and meet each guest at table be it Ellyn or restaurant manager .

2. The marine canter is a stunner ...loved the jet ski rides and snorkeling safari ( it is free )

Water is unbelievably clear and talcum powder sand

3. Pool - we were upgraded to ocean view rooms - and we had a separate pool from rest of the hotel guests ...this was a beautiful infinity pool ...especially during sunset !

4. The sea food restaurant here is a must try especially the sea food platters ! 6 pm is the best time to go there

5 . Indian chef was great too ..:)

4. Above all the staff is very friendly , experienced and their answer is always yes to any of your requests . This level of efficiency and service is second to none , especially a large / busy hotel such as this .

Top notch Work , Shangri-la team Mactan !",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We were lucky to have met April who helped us with our check-in. The process was a breeze and we were lucky to be given a free upgrade from. Bay Wing suite to the Ocean Wing Suite. The room has a separate living and bedroom. 2 twin beds in the bedroom and a sofa bed that can open up to a noisy double bed in the living room. Can tell that the hotel may not be very new. TV had to be changed as the technician could not resolve getting rid of the noisy background sound. The staff here are very friendly and helpful.

We enquired about the free shuttle to SM mall a few times a day. However we were not told we need to reserve seats so when we were out to wait for the shuttle, we were told it was fully booked. Luckily April and another male staff came to our rescue and we were able to hitch a ride out to the city.

The Ocean Club Lounge is by far the best deal here. From 4.30-6.30pm daily, it is family cocktail and 6.30-8.30pm is adult cocktail time where kids are not allowed. There are free finger food, dessert and drinks (alcoholic and non alcoholic) served daily. We actually had our dinner here for a few nights as they served tomato sauce penne, fried chicken, black pepper beef etc. This lounge is only open to Ocean Club occupants and Diamond members.

There is E zone (Time Zone), Adventure zone where kids and teenagers must be in long sleeved b4 they can play here.
There is free snorkelling safari daily at 1pm where the instructors will take you to tour around the marine sanctuary and feed the fish. The coral reefs are healthy and there are many fishes swimming just at the edge of the beach. Wonderful sight!
Breakfast is the usual Shangri-la standard and the korean spread is superb as this place is a mini korean town. Too many koreans here.

There are 2 pools, one main pool with water slide and kids activity area and the pool is meant for Ocean Club occupants only.

Overall, we are satisfied with our stay here. Beautiful!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"There’s a lot of things to make kids happy here - the beach, the pool, the aquaplay area, adventure zone (even one for toddlers), minigolf, and a small arcade. We also did the glass bottom boat which included fish feeding that my kids really enjoyed. We are happy with our stay and would be open to return the next time we have a long weekend to spare.

The only drawback was really that their restaurants only open at 12, which is too late for my kids who eat at around 11. Most disappointing was Acqua restaurant which had poor service, specific details of which are in my restaurant review.

Other than that, the stay would have been a really good one for us to remember. I hope they make improvements in their restaurant service and opening times.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I would like to deeply congratulate Shangri-la staff, including interns (Lorea, Michelle, etc) as their attitude was amazingly right, willing to help, positive, a true blessing to be here for 2 days of decompression.

"This is my spouse’s first visit to the Philippines but in large part due to our experience at this resort, it won’t be our last. One of my cousins posted a picture on Facebook of their stay at this resort. After I read the TripAdvisor reviews, I decided to book a room in the Ocean Wing. Despite the intermittent rain, we enjoyed our stay immensely. We especially enjoyed eating at Acqua and at Cowrie Cove because the food is delicious, especially the Suman, Puto Mayo, and the native chocolate drink. The chef in Acqua should be commended because the pasta with Truffle oil & porcini mushrooms is as good as any in Italy. Joya & Edred in Acqua & Christine & Jenny in Cowrie Cove were genuinely warm & embody Cebuano hospitality. The hotel staff is exemplary, hardworking, & efficient. I’m so thankful that we didn’t have to eat in the Tides restaurant with the hordes of undisciplined children who are allowed to cry, scream, & run around freely. I speak as a parent of now adult children who were never allowed to behave in a way that would disturb adults around them. The only negative things I saw was that there is only 1 sink in the bathroom and no exhaust fan. Despite that, I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay at this resort.",Food:Staff
"The whole resort will amaze every guest, as always choosing Shangrila hotels will satisfy the value of your money.

But for this particular stay, we have some expirience that makes us unsatisfied; First, we reserve 2 upper floor panorama rooms but upon arrival we are settled at ground floor. Secondly,
we ordered in-room dinning on our last night last Oct. 29, 2017, and it was served afer 1 hour and 30 minutes. Lastly, we occupied rooms 1004 & 1005 both rooms were dirturb by the noise (foots step, door closing and furniture being drag on the room above us), we don’t know why such noise was not address the room sound proofing.

"It has been 3 years to date since I wrote our last review of Shagri-La .
Since then we were blessed with another child and we though that Mum deserved a holiday in one of the best island's resort of Cebu Mactan.
After 3 years there were a few surprises of new accommodations and services.
It's fine to have beautiful building and costly decorations, but what really makes a holiday resort to stand out are his employees.
The staff attitude and professionalism is just outstanding, building upgrades are just icing on the cake.
Mum had a marvellous 5 days stay which she described as fabulous.
We would like to thank the staff individually as they made our life so safe and comfortable for the brief period we were there.

"Amazing place with amazing people. Everything was perfect from our arrival to our departure. My husband and I stayed for 3 nights and we wish we could have stayed for another week at least.

What really made the stay fantastic for us besides the superb hotel amenities was the staff. Everyone (and I mean everyone - the receptionists, the servers, the security and maintenance people) were so warm and friendly. We'd be walking around the property, lounging by the pool or the beach and every time an attendant would walk by, we'd receive a warm smile and a greeting.

I'd especially like to commend Clyde, Sigmund, and James for being excellent receptionists.

We can't wait to come back.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Instead of booking a suite, we instead booked a regular room located at the Ocean Wing with access to the Ocean Wing Club floor located on the 8th floor.
Private Check in was at the 8th floor club floor. Coffee and pastries available while checking in! Plenty of comfortable seats and tables. What a convenience!
One of our two rooms was ready so we were able to proceed to lunch signing our bill to the room. Another convenience.
As usual the room was very clean with fresh sheets that smelled and felt clean. This allows for a restful nap! After this we checked out the beach front. Very nice swim. Plenty of towels. Excellent service.
Tried out the gym on the same level as the 3rd floor Lobby access. The attendant was very good making sure I had all that I needed. The jacuzzi was working with good air jets and nicely warmed water. The attendant Allan should be commended for doing excellent work. The next shift handled by Jojo was equally good.

Anyways, our group very much enjoyed our stay.",Staff:Food
"CONS

1.) encountered a few Shangrila Mactan employees who discriminated me, a local guest, among other incidents here are 2 examples:
- One was the guy who was serving the welcome drinks who bypassed me w/ the offer. He offered welcome drinks to the guest infront and behind me while we were all queing to check-in (check-in wasnt a breeze lol). I would have dismissed it but I was sooo looking forward for my turn to be offered as I was sooo freakin thirsty! (To the mngmnt, if you want to identify and re-train specific employee, I have his photo, as my family took photos of me while lining up).
- another incident was when we were walking in the garden pathway and we wanted to ask for directions. Saw a guy employee, called him,headed towards his direction, chased him but he just kept on walking...... ok we would have dismissed it as maybe he was in a hurry (obviously he heard and saw us) but he acted different towards a Japanese guest (). Japanese tourist was out of his way but going towards his direction but surprise surprise employee went on a full stop and greeted japanese guest with a big smile!

2) the edge of your swimming pool ( the one near the beach) is gross. Pls take time to clean it.

PROS

1.) breakfast buffet at Tides was delicious.",Staff:Food
"Just stayed at the Shangrila and it felt like I just spent a weekend at the Holiday Inn. Very mediocre all around and I don't understand how people could rave about it. Room was dated (about 30 years ago) although comfortable and clean. The hotel was uncomfortably packed with hordes of young Korean couples with their noisy kids. It was like a daycare center and certainly not a place to relax. Noise in the hallway until 3 am with babies screaming and mothers scolding. We tried the Tides, Chinese restaurant, and the Italian restaurant. The Chinese restaurant was mediocre at best and pricey. Tiny portions which made it the most expensive Chinese food we've eaten. The same for the Aquoa Italian restaurant. All I can say it was not refined Italian cuisine but a step up from ordinary Chef Boy R Dee stuff. The design of the restaurant you could have mistaken for a cafeteria. Very mediocre. The crowd at breakfast was something to behold: screaming kids and and wall-to-wall people. I just chose to skip breakfast rather than go through that ordeal. The artificial beach was not bad and we were able to take a few dips in the warm sea water however the swimming pool is a disaster, a huge bathtub again full of screaming kids. We expected a quiet relaxing few days but as I have related above, everything was mediocre, crowded and noisy. This was the worst stay in a Shangrila we have experienced and we've been to many!",Comfort & Facilities:Food

They’ve got friendly and accommodating staff, especially the lifeguard at the pool area and Mr. Albino they helped us with our wet phones when it suddenly rained. They assisted us with a bowl of rice to help dry up our phones. But our stay would not be possible and hassle free, without the help of Mr. Homer from the guest service center. He assisted us from booking the room and airport pick up and give us a warm welcome. Looking forward to stay again soon.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"This place is simply beyond belief good. The employees are just fantastic making your stay amazing.

It started with making the reservation where Ms Ann really was very helpful to find the best package that suited my family needs having 3 small kids.

The main wing is newly renovated and the rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable.

The hotel is amazing with several restaurants to choose from, a small par 3 golf course which is free to use and excellent to practice your P / S clubs as well as your putting skills.

It has a beautiful beach with very clear water and you can swim amongst the fish, in addition there are 2 pools, suitable for adults and kids. There are loads of amenities for kids, like play rooms, slides, etc.

This place is the perfect family vacation.

The best thing about the hotel is the staff. So on the ball, and so attentive and friendly. We stayed there for a week and pretty much knew everyone. Special thanks to Ann, Darren, Joel, Charisse, lovejoy, Niña, Ann(acwa), Khael, Paula, Vanesa, Minerva, Korean front desk lady with a name too difficult for a westerner to get right :-), Zenaida, Rosalyn, Nova, Lisa and the Front desk staff, and also the duty managers. Apologies if I have omitted someone by accident. Long story short: I have never stayed at a hotel where at the end of my stay I knew more than 5 people by name, hopefully this list provides the evidence how great this team is!

"Fortunate to stay here on a business trip to Cebu; unfortunate that I was working nights and trying to sleep during the day so didn't get to enjoy the true beauty of this very open air resort! Checked in after a hard days night of work around 6am. First impression of the open air lobby was peaceful and the orchid arrangements beyond belief.

Joined my colleagues for a very nice buffet breakfast on the lower floor - selections tremoundous and delicious! Walked out and saw a beautiful pool so decided to stroll down and see it. Once at the pool could see the beach so walked a little further and arrived at Shangri-La on the sea. The beach is massive and the water so clear and the fish swimming in schools around the early swimmers/snorkelers. There is a wonderful viewing point that is raised and very peaceful that early in the morning!

Off to my room 6062 - very spacious and a large bathroom. Soaked in the tub and off to bed. This is where there were issues - very noisy with the small children running past the room and the maids constantly rolling cleaning carts past my room. It is all tile and open air outside the rooms so all the noise in intensified. Put a towel under my door but didn't help much! Drifted off to sleep and BAM, they started cleaning the room above me and it sounded like a bomb going off. Slept maybe 2 hours and then had to check out to go to dinner and work and then to the airport - back to Manila.

Perhaps a future return trip would allow a few days here for R&R before the strange hours of work would disturb the peacefulness of Shangri-La.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"This is the second time this year that we stayed at the Shangrila Mactan Resort. We have an option to travel to different destinations around the world but keep coming back to the Shangrila. There's something special here that keeps having us come back. The facilities are incredible but most importantly the service is what sets this place apart. We stayed for 6 days 5 nights. There was something for everyone. We took the shuttle to the city one day and just enjoyed shopping and having the convenient shuttle service was a plus. I enjoyed the gym while my kids were at the adventure zone either playing or doing an activity. My kids loved the pools, beach and the adventure zone. My five year old went back looking for Kris from the adventure zone. I had no idea who that was but she insisted that was her name and she was going to prove it to me during this trip. While they went back they remembered Jessa who greeted them. They asked Jessa about Kris and that was when they found out that Kris had left. For Kris and Jessa to make that kind of impact in a little kid is pretty special and incredible. On our last night there my daughter told Kris we will be back and asked her not to leave the Shangrila. I don't usually write reviews but I felt that this resort definitely deserved an excellent review, especially coming from someone that travels all the time and visited this place twice this year already. The general manager Rene does an incredible job leading his staff. In my opinion, in order to have such a successful business it always starts on top. Thank you Rene, and the whole staff at Shangrila for this memorable experience my whole family will forever remember and appreciate.",Staff
"The beach at the Shangri-la Mactan is rocky. All of us who went for a swim ended up with scratches and wounds from the rocks in the water.

To make up for the artificial beach, the other facilities in the resort were excellent, including a huge play ground and pool water slides for the kids. Service at the resort was also excellent. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay a pleasant and memorable one. Special mention to Kang at the reception for being so accommodating.

Breakfast at Tides was crowded on the weekend we were there. There was a wait to get a table. But, you can't fault a hotel for being full and popular.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"The resort was everything we wanted for our week in Cebu... a short drive from the airport, pretty much all the services & facilities you would expect, and nice friendly & helpful staff! Loved the access to the open water, especially the private marine sanctuary which had a surprisingly high volume of sea-life in it (for something that was so heavily used every day).

Access to and from the resort could be facilitated better by the resort... 30-45 minute waits for taxis were advised by the staff, it ended up being easier and cheaper to book our own cars via Grab. The resort could arrange a steady flow of taxis in so supply would meet the demand.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Our family was greeted with a hotel representative at the arrival of Mactan airport. We were then ushered to the shuttle bus, that would take us to the hotel. Just a short ten-minute ride from the airport, the staff were really helpful with our luggage. The lobby was astounding. It can easily rival any other world-class hotel. The resort seemed to be a popular choice of foreign visitors. A lot of tourists were checking in, during our time. We were given the same quality welcome service, nevertheless. We had the family fun package, and stayed at the Main Wing deluxe family room. It was clean & spacious, the high level of comfort that you expect to get with that pricey room. We had free buffet breakfast at the Tides restaurant, and the food was really awesome. I like the fact that they have a separate area, dedicated specifically for kiddie meals, be it breakfast, lunch or dinner. The Cebu-lechon parade show at dinner time was a delightful treat. Kids will not run out of activities, the kiddie pool seemed to be well-planned, with children's safety in mind. The white sand beach property was gorgeous. One of the clearest water I've ever seen. Overall, yes the stay in this five-star hotel maybe pricey, but the memories you will have with your family, simply because you choose the right place that meets all of your family's needs, are priceless.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

From the moment I arrived at the airport I was able to find the get onto the shuttle with the assistance of one of the hotel staff stationed at the airport. I arrived at the hotel and was welcomed not by my friend and her family, but by welcoming team members that run this hotel. Check in and check out were great! The staff at the lounge in the lobby are AWESOME!!!! Views are amazing! The pork belly burger at the pool is like nothing I've experienced before! I also have to say that my friend had her wedding on the property and I cannot say enough about the level of entertainment available for the guests! I truly thought I was at a celebrity event!!! Fire dancers, traditional dancing, interactive events, ""onolicious"" food/beverages, everything out extraordinary!! I've also never seen so many wait staff attending each wing!!!

"Our family's go to resort in Cebu is definitely Shangri-La. I can't even count how many times we've been here!

Excellent and professional customer service by the staff. Every time we would pass a staff member in the halls or around the resort, they would always greet us with a smile and greeting.

Our Deluxe Seaview Room was very comfortable. Room amenities were good - free wifi throughout the hotel too! One thing I noticed however, was their bath tubs were designed in a way where water would spill out despite the shower curtain due to water gathering on the surrounding bathtub sill. Not a major problem, a little inconvenient, but can easily be solved by requesting for a new bath mat from housekeeping.

Shangri-La's pricing may fair more compared to others, however, the price is definitely worth it with all the facilities available. Swimming pool was very spacious, beach was excellent - we really enjoyed fish feeding (which is only offered on MWF, I believe). The resort also offers free use of life vests so you can swim to the marine sanctuary - however snorkelling equipment will need to be rented at a fee. Don't forget to order a mango shake by the beach!

Towels are offered for use at the beach and pool, however they tend to be laid out on the beach/pool chairs even after guests have vacated so many chairs are unable to be used. The resort could possibly have staff regularly clear out the towels?

The staff at the resort were also very helpful in helping us get around - providing us with different transport options to get to the city, airport and nearby dining outlets. Buffet breakfast at Tides is definitely a must! Great selection - Western, Filipino, Korean etc. Great start to my day!

"Our holidays began very well in the Shangri La on the first day. But the next morning, after our first night, we went to the breakfast while Room Service was cleaning the room.
When we came back, my pijama was impossible to find, we searched the whole room upside down and still not found.
We came to the reception later on that day to notice that it was missing and they said they were calling a number and giving us their feedback the next morning.
The next morning, same, we had to wait for the third day, and on and on.
On our departure, noting was found, and receptionist didn't seem to care that much about it, and did not even tried to propose an economic compensation. Very disappointed for a 5 hotel!",Staff
This was my first visit to Cebu and stayed at this hotel I've stayed a few times at Shangri-La Makati so I pretty much know I will have an outstanding stay and I didn't get disappointed. I upgraded to an Ocean view room and it was wonderful. The place is starting to get dated but it's still a very nice place. Can't say anything bad about the staff. They're all warm and courteous. The only thing I was not too happy about was the food selections. I was there for 3 nights 4 days and the food was all the same day in and day out from breakfast to dinner. The taste of the food is kinda bland and it looks like that's how it is pretty much all over. I have some friends in Bohol at the same time and they told me about the food there also. In any case it was a pleasant stay and I would stay at this hotel again if we ever get back to Cebu.,Food:Staff
"Wonderful hotel. I had a great time staying here. The facilities were wonderful, great restaurants, pools, kids areas, rooms, grounds, private beach...everything you could hope for in a hotel. Our stay was made particularly smooth by a chap called Terence who seemed to just pop up out of nowhere when we needed anything. I would 100% recommend the Shangri-La Mactan, and if I have the opportunity I will definitely look forward to spending more time there in the future.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I stayed at this property for 4 nights and thoroughly enjoyed myself. There was plenty to do. I did not leave the resort for the entire time of my stay. This property offers Pools, beaches, Restaurants,kids activities, gymnasium, entertainment and comfort. I highly recommend this property when visiting Cebu.",Location
"The Shangri-La Mactan resort is a fantastic place to visit while in the Cebu metro area and is relatively close to the Cebu-Mactan International airport. The room, service, and overall resort was fantastic during my stay. I found the breakfast buffet to offer both great Western and Asian options. This resort has a few restaurants and a nice lobby bar. The beach area has plenty of umbrellas and chairs that are free to use. The pool area (which I did not use) was very nice as well. If you are wanting to visit Cebu -- I found that many taxi drivers were not too excited to go in to the city as traffic can be horrific. Overall a great resort with great amenities..",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Just like other Shangri La Hotels in the Philippines (except Shangri La Makati), this too, gives a really cozy family resort vibe. Clean rooms, excellent customer service, amazing spa services and fun activities around the resort, however, the location and food are just my worry.

Location, it is located in Mactan Island, it's an hour ride away from Cebu City. Not most ubers and taxi will cater to that travel and it will cost about 500 Php one way. Hotel shuttle is about 300 Php one way per person so if you want something else, just grab a taxi and just look for restaurants around Mactan area.

When it comes to the restaurants, they are only open for a certain time, the only restaurants available day and night are the Buco Bar and the Lobby Lounge, the rest they close by 2:30 PM. Most of the restaurants are fully booked when in peak season and most will not accommodate you if you come 40 minutes before the closing time. The Buco Bar and Lobby Lounge only provide snacks and drinks. The Tides, very limited selection and the food was really not that great.

I would still book this hotel as it was really relaxing and has excellent customer service. We had no issues checking in early and checking out late, it was fantastic. If you want to have a more relaxing and quiet stay, book an ocean wing room so you have more privacy as they have their own pool.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This is the best resort I have been with my family, the pools and the gardens are amazing. The room has everything you need and is spacious. The food is amazing we enjoy our breakfast in Tide every single day. The Asian restaurant is very good to. We are coming back next year for our vacation. The staff are great. Thank you to make our stay memorable.",Food:Staff:Location
"Quite simply the best resort in the Philippines. One of the most affordable Shangri La Experiences anyone could ever find. I highly recommend this place. The food is fabulous, the service is a 10 out of 10 and setting is marvelous. Scotty dive shop is a must visit too. Xx",Food:Location
"Large hotel surrounding a private beach, a few swimming pools, tennis courts, a few restaurants. The hotel is near by the Cebu Airport, 20 minutes by car. If you don't have to go out, don't! Everything is there and available. But do not be afraid to walk, though! Reception efficient and friendly, rooms were very well appointed (need a mouse pad however), good sound insulation. Good bedding.
Marvellous and well maintained grounds, the garden are manicured!
The hotel is very safe.
Breakfasts at Blue are pleasant but a bit boring. Fair choice but the same selection every morning. Had a superb dinner on the outside deck at Cowrie Cove Restaurant. Nice bar attached to the restaurant.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I would have given this resort 6 stars before... until recently when I found out management ejects guests from some areas of the resort even if these areas are walkable and open to the public because it is beside a breakfast area. They militaristically ask guests what room they are staying in which is a turn off in itself because this resort isn't cheap and people who are relaxing don't want to be grilled. They even go through the effort of making kids who are swimming already to get out of the pool. Their staff go around asking everyone relaxing around the pool what room they are and tell them to go away.

The appeal of this pricey resort is the multiple pool areas and the diminished places to lounge and relax in order to earn more money by closing off an entire area has greatly diminished its value and appeal as a resort.

Staff are obviously uncomfortable implementing policy because they are used to providing guests with the best experience but management's unfortunate decision to prioritize profits is disappointing to say the least.

I think they also decreased their staffing number because food service in the beach was extremely slow (my son fell asleep before the food came out) and the woman serving us told us that there were only a few of them and they were OJT's. They looked harassed and overwhelmed.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
Stayed here in early June for a wedding and have to say the stay was excellent. The air condition in the rooms was fantastic. Views were great. Breakfast buffet was superb. Service was impeccable. You are really treated well here. Everything was fantastic.,Food:Staff:Location
Everything was fantastic --all or most water sports go with the price but the POOLS need to be separated for kids and adults for it is no fun with splashing screaming kids at times when there is a blocked out pool on the other side. Now there r 2 hotels and I switched to the other for the pool was closer and had more shade on it at times. Like I wrote I don't like liquid creamer in my coffee and to this day I don't know what they used as coffee for it perked with NO COFFEE SMELL AND did not taste like coffee and I have no idea what it was so I drank water or milk..Now for you drinkers at 6:30 to 8:30 pm --all seven days and I mean all types but Crown Royal or even Mexican beers ! All in all I could skip the water sports and the Happy Hour for after awhile I gave up the booze. Maybe if they had a bigger discount I would be back but in any case I would try another high class hotel for I liked the pool a lot ! And the staff is really great and very nice ! Wi=fi was good and I was able to keep in contact with my office very easily !,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"This Hotel ticks ALL the boxes. From the moment you reach the reception desk, you're treated as someone special. All the staff are so well tuned into the customers needs. The rooms are spacious and very well looked after. I would definitely recommend the rooms with a sea view. You pull back the curtains and then stare out at the sea, wonderful.
Can I put a special shout out to two members of staff in Tides Restaurant, Guai & Zeni( Sous Chef), as these two superb individuals took time out to cater personally for my sons eating requirements. This attention to detail makes this five star Hotel stand out.
The grounds are immaculate, the facilities are immaculate and I will say without hesitation, we will be back.

"If you really think about it, this resort hotel is not at all pricey. With the ultra clean rooms, hallways and surroundings, excellent international buffets, and accessibility (20 mins away from Mactan International) you are actually getting VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY. Their beach area is pristine (it is also a marine sanctuary), they have an airport shuttle every 30 minutes. Staff courtesy is superb, cleaning and turndown service is as often as twice a day!

"I have stayed in other shangri-la locations and this resort is really nice. As expected of the brand, service is warm and friendly and the rooms are very comfortable. but we are not there for the rooms, the beach is the star attraction. I was informed that the soft white sand was brought in from outside making in a very nice beach front to relax and swim in. The ocean is cordoned off for swimmers whilst further out is for water sports. Plenty of fish to see when you are snorkelling in the sea. Only thing is outside the resort is not as developed and you will need to take a taxi out for other food options. We were very content staying inside and the food options were more than adequate, all be it at resort prices.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"This is a beautiful property that offers a lot of open space and beautiful greenery. The hotel also has a small beach area but it isn't great. The current has too many swells for kids to play in. The resort shines though with its pools that are perfect for families with young children. There are several pools of varying depth in the general pool area. Deep one for adults and also very shallow pools with slides for very young children. It does get quite noisy there so if you are a honeymooning couple I'd suggest you book in the ocean wing which has a separate pool that doesn't get as loud. Aside from the pools, there's also a very nice play gym with staff to keep the kids entertained. The rooms are spacious and tastefully appointed. Service of the staff is really great and made our stay even more pleasurable.

The negatives to me was the buffet breakfast at Tides. Given the number of rooms, the breakfast venue is simply too small. It gets crowded as early as 7am with people having to wait to get a table. The buffet breakfast is also underwhelming in terms of variety and quality of food offered. It is not a 5-star level that you would expect from a hotel charging that much for their room. It should also be noted that the resort is far from the city and there are no nearby food options outside of the resort so you probably will be eating in the different hotel restaurants throughout your stay. There the food prices are a bit on the high side by Philippine standards but still acceptable. We were happy with all out ordered meals. We also used room-service on several occasions and the food was very good as well. However, the price charged for fruit juices is excessively high! Php350 for a watermelon shake is just too much. This is probably 3x as much as it would cost in a regular restaurant.

A must try is the Chi-Spa and it will surely be one of the best massages you'll ever have. You probably won't find another Spa in the Philippines that can match it's ambiance as well as the expertise of the therapists. It is pricey but really worth it!!!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

"My family and I stayed for 3 days and 2 nights at Shangri-La Mactan for the first time to celebrate my husband's birthday. We were booked in a different resort but due our friends' insistence, we had to cancel that booking. This is the premise of my family's high expectation on high quality service for a Shang because they even paid for our hotel stays to convince us to try it and promises that Shang will never fail us.

Arrival

Being first-timers in Mactan, more so, The Shangri-La Resorts, good that they greeted us a warm welcome and directed us to the front desk. The FO was not so accommodating to our questions specially when we're asking for the resort map or whereabouts, what-to-do's, etc.; she did not even directed us to where the elevator was (to go our designated room). I've been to resorts and hotels here and abroad, I think it's proper to show your guests the way towards their rooms or endorse them to the bell man. All she was telling us is download and refer to the resort map! Do not assume that all your guests are a regular to this hotel.

Room

The room is great with living area and 2 queen-sized bed. We booked this because we have 2 teenagers sharing bed with us. Shang insisted for us to get 2 extra-beds (with breakfasts and payment for amenities). I was thinking, that's why I booked this room so we can fit in and just pay extras for the breakfasts. How can you fit 2 extra beds with 2 queen beds??? Well, I knew of a family of five (all adults) stayed there in a standard room and never paid the extras ($100/pax for 3d2n), not even the breakfasts!!! How they'd do that?

The first thing I did was to place all our water bottles in the fridge, lo and behold, there's an opened can of soda! I immediately called their attention because I don't want to be charged by the things we never consumed. By this time, I'm not a happy-stayer anymore. My husband just ask the room attendants about where-to-go, what-to-do, etc. Good thing the room service guys are so accommodating and even brought us extra water and slippers.

Beds are comfortable and so are the pillows. Bathroom amenities are great, they are abundant in towels, bath mat and tissues. The turn down service is just normal - free bookmark, more water bottles but no sweets or so, not even a personal note form the manager.

Resort

The resort is great, every part of it is picture perfect - lovely landscape, white sand, nice beach shore, clean pools and people greeted us everywhere. They have free snorkeling activity where you can feed the fishes, which our kids really enjoyed.

Cowrie Cove

We reserved early (as soon as they opened) for us to grab a nice area near the waters. At 8pm we're there and no seats available near the open area? That's what reservations are for, right?! I don't want to spoil the lovely night, we just settled near the entrance and ordered a seafood platter good for 4pax. While we were eating, I noticed that we are lacking the lobster in the platter, instead my husband was eating little squid HEADS!!! We called the server and told her our disappointment, she asked us if we were informed that lobster is not available that night. First, NO we were not informed, because if we were, we could have opted to order a different dish. Second, so you will give us squid heads in exchange for the pricey lobster?!?! Third, we asked if they will charge us a lesser price for it and the answer was no. Good thing my hubby was still in the middle of finishing the squid heads since me and my kids don't want to eat them, the server saw the remnants of it in our platter.

Well, they felt sorry about it and gave us more prawns and scallops. They also gave us free mini desserts for my husband's birthday.

Breakfast

Shangri-La breakfast is an extra ordinary experience. Lot of food/cuisine varieties from Japanese, Korean, Chinese, American, European and of course our very own. Small kids would really enjoy the kids' corner, their own buffet selection. We enjoyed the fruits, bread, egg station and most of all - ice cream for breakfast! How's that? We enjoyed it very much.

Concierge

How can a prestigious hotel cannot offer a free shuttle to a very near airport of Mactan? We booked for a shuttle for Php200/pax the night before but the attendant said we can also flag down a taxi or Grab/Uber.

Check Out

We settled our bill on our last night which I find very convenient. Check out was a breeze! Well, I'm ready to go home anyway.

Each morning crowds lined up for a table and we were actually turned away one Sunday morning as they would be closing before we'd even been seated! It's full, noisy and unpleasant.

"After a bit of a bad start, this hotel was really enjoyable. A lot of the problems I am sure were one off's and to a certain extent not in the control of the hotel itself, although perhaps a little more effort or attention to detail could have avoided these things. The bed linen had blood stains on the duvet cover and pillow case - not the greatest of starts. Housekeeping tried to get into the room at 6am even tho we were staying for another night (this was due to booking the nights separately and the system threw up we were an early departure to rebook the room - understandable, one of those things but avoidable). Unfortunately, all this was compounded by our neighbours who's children sounded like they were being ritually sacrificed given the screaming and the running up and down the halls at 3am. So yeah, first night not great.

After coming to reception to see what could be done, and being greeted with two ladies screaming at each other because one's 5 year old had pulled the hair of the other's 5 year old and they wanted the police involved........ really........ anyway - following this, the manager couldn't be more helpful. Moved to another room away from the slaughter of children and upgraded too. Beautiful room looking over the pool and beach (I would highly recommend it if the option is there).

The beach is lovely but, at least at the time we went (March), nearly impossible to get a bed on after 8am (there are lots of families with young children, so they are up EARLY - not my lie in bed till 11ish, another 30 mins snooze and wander down for breakfast / lunch).

I do tell a bit of a lie - we did make it down for breakfast and, understandably, they are very punctual about times. But wasn't a problem. We sneaked in just before last orders and while the huge, HUGE brunch style food was being cleared away we were happy to pick over the best of the rest - much local dishes and incredibly incredibly tasty!

There's not much in the way of bars and social areas in my opinion. There's a nice bar at the entrance to the hotel but it feels like a reception and there was a band on which sort of inhibited chatting and just felt weird. There are a couple of areas towards the beach area but they were open at odd times and again, not really for me. There is plenty to choose from in terms of restaurants but again, felt quite formal - which seemed strange when there are so many families with young children. But they seemed to love it! So we managed to get a cab down the road to some of the great restaurants / street food places outside. Tho the hotel cab service is a bit slow, so either make sure you download Grab - Uber like app - or nip to the front of the hotel as there is usually a cab waiting.

Anyway - back to the resort - the swimming pools are excellent, there is a marine activities place and you can just rock up and jump on a jet ski if you like. There's a cracking little pitch and putt golf course and it is exquisitely set out.

Let's not beat around the bush - it's like paradise! The blue skies, the greenery, and even if you can't get on the beach, there's room around the pool and in the gardens to sit out and just relax..

So, my view would be, great place for families. Might not be the quiet secluded chill place for couples but it's a Shangri-La - the staff are amazing, the facilities are great, the choice of restaurant is, on paper, very good but maybe a little plastic, but the food - at least what I tasted - was fantastic. But it's not cheap.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

This is not to say that our stay was perfect. Sometimes the food served was not up to par. But then the positive way that our feedback was received and their promise to look into the problem and ensure that it does not happen again gave us confidence that our opinion counted and we are in good hands.

I hope the front desk could be a little more accommodating. We arrived at the hotel earlier than the check in time to avoid the air traffic at NAIA.

"Booked myself and my partner a last minute beach break from our 2 week long Hong Kong holiday and decided to chose Mactan Island. Unfortunately as it was so last minute the Shangri La was fully booked and so we reluctantly opted for another resort.

We decided to pop down to Shangri La anyway to enquire if any cancellations had come up for any of the days we were in the Philippines. Upon arrival we were greeted by friendly faces and a beautiful lobby. To no avail nothing was available. We asked concierge if we could take a look down to their beach which was absolutely fine.

Once we arrived to the beach, must have been around 3 seconds later, we were asked by security if we were guests, I said no, to which security said 'they will be waiting for you at the lobby'. I explained that we asked if we could come down to see and the security told me that the beach area is reserved for in-house guests only. Hot and bothered, Basking in 35 degree heat, we make ourselves back up to the lobby again. Once we got there we were cornered by a few security men from all angles, all whispering on their earpiece, ushering us out of the hotel like common thieves.

We felt absolutely humiliated! Disgusting behaviour towards anyone, whether they were in house guests or not. Are guests from outside the hotel not allowed to use the hotels facilities, restaurants, beach/pool???? No excuse.

If you want to chill and relax this is not the place to be since this resort has too many weddings and conventions going on at the same time,worst everyone has the same access to amenities which makes everything crowded.

Easy access to the beach area if you're staying in the ocean wing. Renovated rooms are in the main wing.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"Visited this resort almost a decade ago before we had kids and we came back with two kids in tow for the Easter long weekend. Was definitely a different experience and the kids had an amazing time.

Check-in: booked an Ocean Wing Club Room which came with complimentary airport shuttle transfer. Arrived a bit earlier than check-in time, however our room was not ready until after 4pm. Marie, the manager on duty gladly gave us a complimentary dinner buffet at Tides to compensate.

Rooms: very ordinary in size and quality. We had a King bed with sofa bed which was ok for our family of four but a little bit tight. Would not recommend the Ocean Wing Club Room unless you expect to make use of the Club Lounge on the eight floor. I think there may be bigger room options in the Main Wing. We were on the 6th floor facing the beach/pool. Nice view but note that there is a dinner performance at Buko Bar everynight, so avoid if the kids sleep early and are light sleepers.

Club Lounge: Lounge was not very large in size so during family hour (4:30-6:30) and adult hour (6:30-8:30) it was pretty packed. Outside of those hours, not much in the lounge other than some non-alcoholic drinks and cakes. Not a huge perk unless you are a big drinker and plan to go during happy hour to load up on alcohol. Our kids did have dinner there for free several times as they eat earlier so I think all in all, we made good use of the lounge.

Pools: main pool was definitely very kid friendly with a small water playground and big slide for the kids. Not enough lounge chairs by the main pool. Ocean Wing pool is supposed to be for Ocean Wing guests only but didn't see anyone checking (maybe when you check out towels, they ask for your room number). This pool is definitely nicer although not as fun for kids.

Beach: well maintained and the best part were all the fish that swam up close to shore (which is what people refer to as the marine sanctuary). Kids had fun snorkeling and seeing the fish. There were a lot of shaded beach chairs but given number of guests, also had to go early to ""reserve"" one. Another Ocean Club benefit was complimentary rental of snorkeling and kayaking equipment. Also tried out jet skiing for the first time which was fun.

Food: Tides - The breakfast buffet at Tides had a tremendous spread with a lot of variety. You can also have breakfast at Acqua but it had a much more limited selection (less than half of what is at Tides). We didn't have problem getting a table as we usually went at 7am, but by 7:30, there would already be a line. We also enjoyed their dinner buffet there which was very heavy on the meat but yummy. Food quality at Tides was very good.

Acqua - had lunch twice and breakfast once here. Pasta was generally good. Pizzas were ok. Nice view by the pool.

Buko Bar - had lunch here twice. Salads were not very good (soggy) but the other items, including the barbecue chicken was excellent.

Cowrie Cove - had dinner here once. Just ok although did not splurge on seafood platter.

Nice perk to allow kids below 12 to have a free buffet when accompanied by adults. Price was very reasonable. A la carte lunches came out to around PHP1250-1500 for a family of four. Buffet dinner was PHP2500.

Facilities/Activities: Adventure Zone was popular with the kids. I like that you could pay by the hour and split up the hours you bought over several days (PHP200/hour, PHP350 for 2 hours or PHP1000 for the day). The E-Zone was also popular for older kids. They had a lot of Easter themed activities including a breakfast and show at the Rosal Ballroom (which they let us join after our breakfast at Acqua next door). The Easter egg hunt was also a lot of fun. Expect a lot of candy to be handed out though",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Celebrated my birthday at Shangrila Mactan. First time to visit with my husband and two kids ages 4 and an 8month old. Was greeted by the staff who put a flower bracelet on our wrist. While waiting at the lobby to check in, refreshments were offered. Got a room with twin beds and they were able to join them together with something that they put in the middle to make it look like a big bed. There were activities for all ages. From babies to adults. Great beach, clear calm waters. You get to feed and swim with the fishes. However i found a plastic bag floating away. Lot's of pools to choose from. Not crowded at all. Friendly staff. Everyone is smiling and accomodating. Entertainment while having dinner was a very nice experience most especially for my boy. It was his first time to watch fire dancers. Complimentary rubber slippers and hair tie was a nice touch. By the way, i got a surprise birthday cake when we got back to the room after dinner. Overall, great experience. While still there i was already looking at the calendar for dates when we can come back. My son was saying he misses cebu already even before we checkout.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
Just came back from Cebu. Been in this resort many times since years ago. Never write comments before but I feel I want to this time. We travel a lot with our two daugthers as long as they have long holidays. There are two staffs I would like to thank specailly. The young gentlemen Rhenzo who serves by the ocean wing pool and Renz who serves by the beach. They are so friendly and attentive. Even small things they did but had big impression on us.Everyone of the staffs are great too and I am grateful. Please keep up with this and I will see you soon.,Staff:Food
"We were able to book a premier room by the Ocean wing for half the price thanks to an ongoing promo for local tourists. Our overnight stay came with a free breakfast buffet, 2 rounds of complimentary bottled water and a tray of fruit.

The place was stunning! You can do much more than swimming since there were plenty of amenities such as karaoke rooms, gym, gaming room and kids play area.

I was a bit turned off though when we were not entertained right away (nobody ushered us to a table, waiter took time to give the menu, it took quite an effort to catch their attention) at their Aqua resto. I think we went there after the lunch buffet and they were very busy cleaning up. Somehow they redeemed themselves when a kind waiter provided my 1 yr old daughter with a baby plate and spoon to play with.

The food was superb but unsurprisingly expensive so you might want to eat outside of the resort to save on costs. You can take the shuttle service going to SM City and Ayala Center for a minimal fee. You can not bring your luggage btw.

The resort is a favorite venue for special events particularly for those with bigger budget. There were two weddings happening simultaneously by the time we were eating dinner at the Cowrie Cove resto. It was lovely to watch fireworks display for free. Haha. When we came back to our room after dinner, a complimentary bottle of wine and cake was laid out at the minibar for me! My husband mentioned to the reservation staff that we were staying there for my birthday when he booked. I really appreciated this gesture!

Overall, it was a good experience and it was worth it.",Value for money:Food:Staff

Of the Front Desk, Ms. Guia of Aqua, Jomari of Tea of Springs and Big Mike of Tides all went out of there way with their exceptional guest service skills to make our family vacation a memorable one that we would never forget!

We had dinner & cocktails at Cowrie Cove Restaurant, which is right on the water. They have a happy hour every day there too. Next to it, there is a small beach, & we went jet-skiing there.
The breakfast buffet is very good, as is the Italian restaurant.
The resort caters to many Korean guests, and they all seemed to be having a good time! I felt welcomed as well.
Our room was a Main Wing Seaview room. We had an uninterrupted view of the resort grounds & the ocean. The room was clean, & staff dropped us off extras (such as water) quickly.
I used the gym, & the equipment is good. Jacuzzis are in the changerooms, which my wife used.
I would recommend this resort to anyone!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I was in Shangrila Mactan on April 10 to 13 with my family and we had an enjoyable time.

Hotel management showed their experience in dealing with the peak season. Upon arrival we were directly ushered to our room bypassing the formal check-in process.

Management already alerted guests of breakfast traffic to influence guests to come in earlier or later and avoid the breakfast backlog.

In order to entertain my 3 year old, the hotel had activities throughout the day and amenities to keep her busy (pool playground, indoor playground). When we left they even had an Easter buffet for children with shows.

Shangri-la Mactan truly knows how to take care of their guests. Shang Mactan is truly a sanctuary in the midst of a busy and traffic Cebu Province. One can stay here the whole day and enjoy without leaving the confines of the hotel.",Food

Theres so many things to do at the resort whether it's for kids, family or for couples. Everyday there are different activities to do and there are so many different restaurants you can choose form. Will come back here again for sure, and this time i'll make sure to stay even longer.",Staff:Food

Everything was top of the line, the kids zone was awesome for those rainy moments, water park, beach area, restaurants. We didn't stay too long, but this is our resort for all future trips. We will return. I don't have her name, but one staff member was especially gracious to us. The best I can do to thank her is posting the picture of her with our son.

"I was booked for 11 nights in this hotel. As a long staying guest, the hotel presented additional amenities that they can provide to me for free. I decline most of it except that I requested that I be provided a shaver regularly. It didn't came except when I called the attention of the housekeeper. The hotel gave me 1 shaver for my entire stay. Likewise, as a standard procedure, the hotel used my credit card for the incidentals deposit. However, their system charged more than the required amount which resulted to the blocking of my card. They admitted the error on their part but it took them more than a week to cancel the amount. In addition, their breakfast area is overcrowded, its a long wait to have breakfast. Lastly, I requested for late checkout for at least a couple of hours to match it with my flight out. Unfortunately, the front desk told me that they cannot accommodate my request because they are ""fully booked"". However, when I checked online, the room bookings for the next day is still open...too much to asked for a long staying guest....",Staff:Value for money
"Here you have several excellent restaurants, a huge and quiet property, a private and clean beach, and top service.

I'm often in Cebu. I come a long way from beyond center city to eat at their Chinese and Italian restaurants, and the buffet is also a favorite. Every single employee is attentive, respectful, helpful and polite--and there are plenty of these employees here. The beauty of the landscaping is unique.

A disadvantage: if you need to park your car, it may not be near your room. But that's only a small criticism. Shangri-La is mainly patronized by Koreans and other Asians, with kids. It a very nice group, very child-friendly. They have great play facilities.

"Very much a family resort...it's not really suitable for couples, friends who are looking for a quiet getaway.

The rooms are nice, with very comfortable beds but our room in the main wing looked onto a rooftop not exactly what we were expecting for almost $400 (SGD) a night.

The lobby and grounds/gardens are very beautiful with a lovely private beach. The staff at the beach and beach bar are great and help to get chairs/shade/drinks sorted for you.

In other parts of the resort service needs to be improved considering the standard at other Shangri-la hotels and the high price point of this particular resort.

Overall the food options are pretty good but not cheap; water is very expensive to buy and only one option, Evian available in the hotel shop. Staff are not very informative of options outside of the hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"We booked a deluxe family room, which provides more space as it is located on a corner of the main wing. We were two adults and two children, and the room was very spacious, with two large beds, a huge bathroom, sitting area and ample storage space. So if you're travelling with children make sure you book this.

If you are offered a special package to include evening buffet dinner, I'd highly recommend it, particularly as there are very limited dining options outside of the hotel. The buffet is extensive and covers many different national cuisines. Free-flowing wine also is much appreciated! In the restaurant they even have a wandering band, which can sing pretty much any song you can think of. The package also includes free snorkelling and access to the indoor adventure zone play area.

The facilities are great for children with large swimming pool, water slides and a water play area. The grounds themselves are extensive, so lots of room to run around. There are also two nice beaches and a water sports centre offering lots of activities.

A couple of tips:
> The breakfast was super, but plan your breakfast time carefully, as it can get very busy with a queue to get in. Before 8.30 am is better.
> If you want to do a tour on the day after you arrive, I'd suggest booking it before you get there. The tour desk closes quite early and there may be limited availability.

Overall, I can wholeheartedly recommend the hotel to families. Upon leaving, my son didn't want to go, and said we wanted to live there!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Stayed in the ocean wing - must say that the hotel should continue to extend its renovation project to the wing as well as some of the common area facilities. The room was a bit aged and the A/C was a bit too strong for someone return from the ocean / pool.

One can tell that a lot of thought went behind designing the hotel originally to cater to families or couples looking for a short weekend away. The kids play area looks impressive, and there two pools, of which one has water slide and other stuff to keep children entertained. There's a ping pong and pool table in premises, though age and the sheer amount of travelers have taken a toll on some of the facilities and maintenance is a challenge.

The food at all restaurants are good in general! My favorite place there is the western seafood grill. Also had the best mango daiquiri at the bar.

The best feature of the resort is the marine sanctuary- diverse species and lot of effort went into keeping guests informed of healthy ocean life and how to be environmentally friendly. The crew there are committed conservationists.

A perfect place for a three-day excursion. Would feel a bit trapped if I stayed longer.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"We travel a lot and have stayed in numerous resorts and I would say that nothing would beat the service we received during our stay in this resort. Everyone we encounter went the extra mile to make our stay a memorable one. We were greeted with friendly smiles the second we got off the shuttle bus from the airport. Since we checked-in early (early flight) and no room was available we were still able to use the amenities while waiting for a room. Joan was such a great person to deal with during check-in. John and Michael from the Buko bar allowed us to eat there while waiting and even prepared food for us early. This resort has the nicest beach in the area with so many free activities for the entire family. We went snorkeling with Moses as our tour guide and the entire team made us feel safe as my wife is not a strong swimmer. The breakfast buffet was great - so many selections, not only local but international as well. The gym was clean, jacuzzi is located inside the locker area and you can also utilize a fitness instructor if you like. There is also free entertainment in the lobby at 8pm every night. We enjoyed the cover songs played by the band. The band took song request and even took the time to chat with us during their breaks. Alexine and Amelie were so polite when taking and delivering orders and were very friendly. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back again.",Staff:Food
Shangri-la still lives up to its reputation of being a luxury resort. The family room in the main wing is newly refurbished and was even better than some of the ocean view rooms. Breakfast can be chaotic during peak times but staff somehow manage to cater to everyone. Food in the restaurants are also reasonably priced. There's no real need to go out of the resort. Staff were warm and accommodating especially at Tides. Will definitely go back again.,Food:Staff

I am a regular guest at this resort, I go there almost every month, I purchase bulk whenever I can, and let my family stay there booking 4-5 rooms for a couple of nights whenever they are in the Philippines. I have even made friends with some lovely employees. This resort is so beautiful and tranquil that is why I keep coming back, but it is disappointing in my part to experience that one employee or some employees of a certain department of this resort don't value low profile regular guests.

Ambience is really superb as well as the food. What's disappointing is that pools are renovating and the only one that's in good swimming condition is at the Ocean Wing which is only exclusive to it's occupants. I find it really discriminating - why just because they are paying a hefty amount that's why they have certain entitlement? Then may i suggest that since occupants of that wing wouldn't like to mingle with those that of other room category they have they breakfast too at acqua and not at Tides (where everyone's accommodated).

Location is fantastic with a private beach, big gardens and a private coral reef (do the snorkel safari to get the best out of it). Staff super friendly and helpful as usual at SL. But sometimes communication with staff, and between them, doesn't always work out. My wife found this a bit stressful as she had meals twice which were not as ordered. Restaurant choice OK but not the best, and food can be a bit hit and miss. We stayed in Ocean Club, which gives all day grazing and long free cocktail/food period.

"Having returned to this resort hotel after 17 years, we were literally shocked by the immense presence of guests from nearby Asiatic countries, above all South Corea. Since the owner of the hotel had enlarged the hotel which now offers some 650 rooms, the only way to fill it seems to offer cheap package tours, whith the result that service suffered. This was painfully clear at the buffet breakfast, where one has to queue to get seated and where one has to be extremely careful not to run into some not so educated co-guests.
On the positive side we loved the friendliness of the staff who did everything possible to make our stay a pleasant one, in spite of the bad weather. I would like to mention here Berle and Ann at the Italian restaurant, and above all Rhenzo, Julie and Edgar at the beach, offering a top service.
The only negative encounter we had was with a supervisor of F&B who set up dinner parties at the beach, on one occasion literally chasing us away and loosing one of our slippers, in spite of the fact that he had not sealed off that beach area on that occasion.",Food:Staff

"I liked my stay in Shangri-la Cebu I must say. But I may just be expecting more perhaps in a Shangri-la signature hotel, aside from the price I am paying. Let me share some of my thoughts.

The room, I must say is nice. I liked how they gave me even a complimentary wine and a cake when I told them, We were celebrating our anniversary. The toiletries they used were only regular in-house. Unlike other 5 star premium hotels which may even use premium branded toiletries such as l'ocitane to give a premium feel to the customer.

For the food, I felt it is overpriced compared to the menu they are offering, even the buffet is overpriced. A 2000++ buffet, from a food menu such as the regular ones (adobe, pansit) is not worth it. I can eat a better meal in Shang here in Manila for the same price but better food assortment.

Regular orders they have wouldn't go below 500 pesos ++, even for a simple menu such as bistek tagalog.

The breakfast is just also Ok. Not that outstanding. Not too varied, and food served is just a typical ones. I was expecting more for a 5 star hotel.

The facilities on the other end, seems OK. You can have something to do and be busy with while in the resort. I liked the idea of certain scheduled activities within the day where guests can participate. The only problem is, if there are only few guests. Joining, they may cancel the activity without notice to the guest joining.

Some of the facilities I have used such as billiards area are worn out, despite them charging significantly a certain amount when you use them. The billiards area with pay, their cue sticks somehow have damages already. Not maintained well. Some Tables have partly tattered areas. The free billiards area are even worse, tables And sticks are all tattered.

The pool area should be nice. But the beach area may be a challenge especially if the sea is uncooperative. You may end up not swimming if the beach is at a certain alert level where they will prevent guests to swim.

They have a lot of Japanese and Korean guest I should say, and these will be a challenge to you if you will take ur breakfast in the morning since there is a pile of cue waiting.

Overall, I enjoyed the trip, but the price I paid, I should say is too steep for the service I got.",Food:Value for money
"A very very well equipped resort with plentiful activities for friends and family. The restaurants are very good but slightly expensive and can be overcrowded especially during breakfast hours. If you are interested in diving/snorkeling, they have a dive shop on the resort grounds (there is staff available in the main lobby for booking inquiries). The main building ocean view rooms give you a good glimpse of the ocean and are cheaper than ocean wing rooms. However since the resort has been around for awhile, the rooms are slightly run down. If you are unafraid of a short walk (5-10 minutes) there are good restaurants just outside the resort (Spanish and Italian).",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Excellent stay with the family at Shangri-La Mactan Island! The food was really good at all restaurants at the resort. A bit over priced but still worth it. We personally recommend buying a family package, if available, that includes one load of laundry service, unlimited kayak/snorkel use, and dinner with unlimited beer/wine, juices and sodas. There are numerous activities for children, teens, and adults that will keep you super entertained! There is something for everyone here. The beach area, which is a fish sanctuary, was gorgeous. Beds were large and comfortable. The place was a little outdated but one could barely tell with the overall opulence that Shangri-La is known for. The resort spa was very relaxing; we took advantage of the spa package when we first booked the room to take advantage of added credit.

Accompanied my Husband for a 5 day conference he had to attend. Lovely spacious rooms ..right next to the ocean. It was all for what one expects out of a Shangrilla but what stood out the most was their concern and care when I fell sick. Without asking they sent a nurse after very few hours to check on me knowing my Husband was away all day. Sent special soups and some local concoctions to help ease out my throat. Went back fully recovered and really happy.,Staff

"We are Shangri-La Golden Circle members and usually enjoy the brand. We booked a ""Couple's Retreat"" package at Mactan, and looked forward to a romantic and peaceful 4-night getaway. But we did NOT find it. This resort is completely overrun with children.

Children and families have a very large Main Wing pool with slides, fountains, etc. , so we upgraded to the Ocean Wing to use that ""exclusive"" pool. But by 10am, there were literally more children than adults at the ""exclusive"" pool - including infants in diapers!

Worse, we had also upgraded to the ""Club"" level, but even that wonderful private lounge had children running around or crying at all times we were there. Why allow children in the private Club Lounge, when families can also go everywhere else? There are only two places where adults can enjoy solitude: the Chi Water Gardens (lovely!) and the 2-hour adults-only happy hour in the Club Lounge. But we literally did not eat any meal in any restaurant without children crying or running around unattended. It was a complete disappointment for a resort offering a ""couple's retreat.""

Rooms are very spacious and comfortable, but will need to be updated soon. (Scuff marks, stains, etc.) Beach is small, crowded, and not very pretty. Lifeguards seemed to have a bad attitude - probably because the children are so poorly behaved.

VERY GOOD: The house reef is small but something they obviously care for and take pride in. I do give very high praise to the staff, and to the quality of food and service. Those things are very much up to our previous experience with Shangri-La standards.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Most people are kind and friendly, and the sea is fantastic.
The food of Tides is good. I liked the song and dance time in Tides.
The performance of Bukobar is excellent. My kids really enjoyed it.

I recommend not to use the Lobby shop.",Food:Staff:Location

"Not what I expected for a 5 star hotel. If you like the look of a golf course, you'll like it. Manicured lawns. Long walk to the beach. Uphill coming back. View was great from the beach. Hotel lobby too hot. Ceiling too high for fans to move the air. Food was excellent and plentiful. Looked like there was a lot of indoor activities for kids and and fitness room good for workouts. Too exhausting for just relaxing as it required a lot of walking to pools and beach area. Arrived late in the evening, tired from traveling all day and had to call to have the room cleaned.Overpriced most likely because of marketing strategies. There are better hotels on Cebu to check out.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"We visited the hotel to see Lapu Lapu's offering, after staying at the fantastic Radisson Blu in Cebu City.

I have to say, it was very disappointing indeed. The staff take themselves - and the hotel far too seriously, at the expense of the guests, who seem to be way down the pecking order of importance and care.
Reception staff are especially cold, to the point of indifference and rudeness, and it was only when we spoke to one of the manager's, that things improved.

On one positive note, the beach team were very different - friendly and helpful, and operate on an entirely different level to the rest of this resort.

This didn't last however, when we went up at the pool. We were told by another rude member of staff to vacate our loungers as we were not staying overnight at the hotel! Unbelievable.

I've stayed in 5 star hotels and resorts all over the world ,and never received treatment like this .The management here need a serious wake up call as to how guests are being treated.

So, beware, if you stay - even at $500 a night, judging by our treatment, you will be just another number at the Shangri La.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"This place is like the typical Shangri-La resort - it is family-oriented and is almost too massive. Stayed in a room in the Main Wing which has been renovated already and the amenities within the room are what you would expect. They are supposedly upgrading the TV reception in each room and until then, you would find 2/3 of the TV channels with ""snowflakes"" or no image at all (not that you should be watching TV here anyway, but for those you like to keep up with what's going on in the rest of the world.) You can easily feel trapped in this resort since there are so many things to do, one of which would be just going to the beach and swim in the ocean to see the fish and corals in the crystal clear water (without having to go out in the sea or to other islands). The stretch of Punta Engano where the resorts are is not as built up as other resort towns in Southeast Asia, so most people tend to stay in the resort without stepping outside at all and get ""boxed in"". There is a wide selection for buffet breakfast, but I find the fruit offering underwhelming (only watermelon, pineapple, and mango or papaya for cut fruit and whole apples, oranges and bananas). I would have liked to see pomelo, chico fruit and the likes. Because there are so many guests and it gets crowded in the morning, they open up the seating in the Chinese restaurant and also allow guests in the Main Wing to go to the Italian restaurant for breakfast. The buffet lunches and dinners are pricey; but dinner at Cowrie Cove is quite romantic and reasonably affordable given the setting. For those who want to walk outside for food, try Fiesta Bay which is right opposite Movenpick (turn right and walk about 6 to 8 minutes on Punta Engano). The place is full at dinner time (mostly with Tagalog speaking patrons which is a good sign). Appreciate the shuttle to/from SM Mall and Ayala Center (costs PHP 150 one way between resort and city and can easily take 50 minutes just between resort and SM Mall). To return to the resort, instead of taking the shuttle, one can just line up for taxis outside the malls and get a metered taxi. Because of the traffic jam involved in crossing the bridge and going to Mactan, most drivers would not go by the meter but would negotiate a surcharge. If you have three or four people, you are still better off taking the taxi (in terms of price) compared to the shuttle. The shuttle charge of PHP 200 per person one way to/from airport is too pricey given the actual distance. (Taxis are much cheaper but the problem is.... there are not a lot of taxis around on Mactan in general). Well, they are the most renowned resort on Mactan so I guess they can get away with whatever pricing they want on a lot of things.",Food:Location:Value for money

"This is the 5th hotel we have stayed in so far during our stay in the Phillipines. Despite the price being 2-3 times that of the competitors we have stayed with we have been very disappointed.

To begin with our check-in was slow and chaotic. We were given a map with print so pale it was illegible. We were not informed of any services or activities relevant to our party. It wasn't until we asked for another map the next day that we were told of an app with all this information.

Second - poorly maintained room... broken safe, blocked toilet and only 300mLs of drinking water available (presumably to encourage purchase from expensive mini bar items)... AND no room servicing (one of my favourite parts of staying away is walking back into a tidy room in the afternoon!!)

Thirdly - Zumba class, teacher arrived 20 mins late spent 15 mins getting his equipment set up, which continually dropped out throughout the class.

Overall staff warmth is low and the place is too big to have the intimacy and relaxed feel our other hotels have afforded us. I just felt like this was a money making machine that wants to charge extra for everything!

On the plus side the grounds are beautiful, with magnificent view from our room.",Value for money:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"OH MY GOD, where do I start!!! Just driving up to the hotel the grounds are immaculate and you feel as tho you've been transported to a whole new world. Check in was very quick and very easy thanks to the AMAZING Charisse, Please ask for her when you arrive she is hands down amazing. She made sure I was always taken care of and was always very warm and personable. just walking down the beautifully decorated hall the scent of jasmine wakes up your senses. Upon entering the room, there was a piece of the most rich amazing chocolate birthday cake waiting for me, I don't even like cake or sweets but literally none of it was left!! The beds out of a 10 if give a 7 night quite like cloud heaven but I def did the movie jump fall into the bed. The rooms are very spacious I had the king ocean view. I would recommend getting a pool view as the ocean view is more of a view of the front of the hotel looking out on the bay and city. The bathrooms area amazing and you feel like your in a movie. The bathtub very large and will make you feel like your in bed. The hotel has about 5 restaurants I think they're all buffet style with different world cuisine. I went to two of the restaurants the first was the outdoor buffet that also including a show. The food was sooooo amazing and the show was very entertaining. I can't remember the name of the main buffet but the cuisine changed everyday. The first day was Mexican themed along with all types of other food from other places and the next night it was Italian themed. The food is amazing and Ms. Pam and Syril ARE THE BEST IN THERE!!!! Literally if you don't have them taking care of your table you're missing out!!! Everytime I walked in I they made me feel like family greeted with big smiles and such warm hugs with laughs and conversations about how my day was. Another thing these resort knows how to do are drinks! the happy hour is very happy and the 2 for one special and half off drinks are made too perfection and not watered down like a lot of places. The hotel has about 4 pools one with a mini waterpark for kids. The resort has a GREAT fitness center than includes a nice steam room. Theres also a Huge indoor play zone for kids with climbing structures and tubes def. an awesome place for kids to have the time of their lives. NOW. FOR. THE. BEACH!!!!!!! FLAWLESS, I'm not a big beach person b/c I'm not really a fan of sand but this beach will convert even the strongest detractors. the sand feels like clay there are cabanas and lounges on a first come first serve basis you can relax on. For me the most amazing part their is an amazing reef when you swim out into the water. Not only does the staff and hotel welcome you, when you get into the water the fish do too my god its like this place runs on magic. Theres snorkel equipment you can rent I'd suggest bring your own, scuba diving, jet skis and all types of other fun things to do. I see why people stay at resorts now. I have never been so relaxed in my life. It was literally worth EVERY. SINGLE. DIME!!!!!!

"I was not sure what to expect on my first trip to the Philippines, but I wanted to be sure to avoid any preconceived judgements. Needless to say the drive from the airport in Cebu city was just as one would have imagined if you have any acquaintance with traffic in the cities of the Philippines. On this given day, the streets were hopping with people, cars, motorcycles, and of course Cebu's version of the jeepney. It took about 45 minutes to an hour to arrive at the resort. The driver of the shuttle was friendly and told us a little bit about the resort and area. The resort is well guarded; complete with a K9. We were in the ocean wing of the resort and we were greeted by Terrence the front desk supervisor for the ocean wing (I assumed). Regardless, he was polite and welcomed us. Later in the week we're heading to Bohol and he helped us tremendously by acquiring tickets for the ferry from Cebu to Bohol. Thanks Terrence! It was just one less thing to concern ourselves with. The rooms were very nice and comfortable with all the amenities you could want. There was a large pool area, I'm thinking three. One that was more geared toward adults and one for adults and children and one that was reserved for those who stayed in the ocean wing. And, of course there were the usual pool side servers to make your stay at the pool that much more enjoyable. Admittedly, my stay was quite predictable considering the weather wasn't the best. On rainy days we visited the SM Cebu Seaside mall and even took in the Cebu Historic Tour with Tanya and Ritchie (both were great and Tanya was very informative). I definitely encourage one to hire professional drivers to navigate the city. Before all of this of course; whether the touring or the beach and pool there was breakfast. We made sure we took advantage of the fabulous breakfast buffet at the Tides restaurant. So many different stations, from multiple omelette and egg stations to international foods, Filipino items, and even Korean. I have to ""shout out"" to Roslyn at one of the omelette stations. She remembered me each day and knew how I liked my omelette each time. That's saying a lot considering the number of guests she must see daily. We had dinners there as well. Again great selection of courses and even sushi. We tried the Acqua restaurant for dinner one night and for their breakfast buffet but as nice as it was we preferred Tides. To round out the evening, we had a nightcap or few at the Lobby Lounge and made great acquaintance with some lovely and friendly young ladies. Namely, Eloisa,Kim, Amelyn and Alexine. They too happened to remember what we had ordered prior and were willing to have our drinks of choice already on deck. The great thing about the Lobby Lounge also was that if you were not in the mood for the large buffet, you could order food from the the Tides a la carte menu. I have to admit those were nice evening just the four of us not overindulging in the clamorous busy buffet, but took our time, patiently waited for the items to come out of the kitchen and just talk about the day over some beverages and a light meal/snack. My favorite was the KFC (Korean chicken wings). It's difficult to say whether one will take the 13 hour flight from North America to the Philippines again, but if I did, and Shangri-La's Mactan Resort and Spa was on the itinerary I would not hesitate in the slightest. It was a great intro for me to the Philippines.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"It has been many years since I gave a review in Tripadvisor as it takes time and trouble. However, the eventful stay in Shangri-la calls for my attention to do so again.

Reception:
1. Check-In was a 20 min wait before our turn. The wait was in a standing queue with some live music players at the background. Later, there was a welcome drink. Finally, it was our turn and we were asked if we were willing to go for a combined single bed to make up a double bed. This was a bad approach after a 20 min standing wait. As I had wrote-in my request prior to this, my answer was a firm no. Service was nice and the reception quickly said a queen size bed will be given as requested BUT a wait is required, I asked cordially IF check-in wasn't at 2pm??? I looked at my watch and the time was 2.30pm. This is my first time staying in a Shangri-la hotel so the late ""welcome"" reception was a shock. We paid for a 5-star stay but was given a late check-in instead!

Beach:
However, the initial bad impression received at the reception was quickly blown away by the breezy service at the main wing beach. I was extremely delighted with my luck of getting hold of the cabana the next morning. In order to shield myself from the sun, I was deeply touched when a coffee table was inserted by a staff from the back of the cabana, while I was shaking and adjusting the huge cabana cover. This has helped me get the perfect shade. Till now, I do not know which staff discreetly helped me but it definitely re-oriented my mood for a better start. The sea was rough but we saw many fish while snorkeling although visibility was very low. There was always a guard in a speedboat on standby and the area was barricaded with floats so felt safe.

Swimming Pool:
The pool at the main pool looks enormous from the website picture. It is divided into 4 or 5 sections with only one section suitable for adults and the rest for kids. The depth for adult is at an amazing deep depth of 2.3 m. I love to explore the hotel swimming pools around the world and this is is the only one where the water is really unclear and dirty. Also, even with lights on, the water is too dark for a swim after 5 pm. From observation, the water at the Ocean Wing has more lights so it may be a better choice for night swimmers if you stay in the Ocean Wing.

Food
We tried all restaurants, from Tides( buffet, ala carte, breakfast), Cove (Seaview Seafood), Tea Spring ( Chinese food) and Breeze ( burgers and finger food). The food and services were all good but we especially like the food in Chinese restaurants. We went back twice. In all the restaurants, they went out to make you feel at home, e.g. giving us cut chili with vinegar when we requested. At the Chinese restaurant, we saw a Korean family given Kimchi when they asked for it. This kind gesture struck me that to help tourists feel at home in a foreign land, the host has to be prepared to meet the guests' dietary request to show its high standard of service and, Shangri-la has done it. Also, although there are some who say the food price is pricey but I personally feel it is reasonable, for the standard and services it gives. The average ala carte cost for a couple is usd 50 per meal, include all tax.

Incident
All went well till the last night. After a swim, we went back to our Sea View Main Wing room. Upon opening our door, we were greeted by a turpentine smell from the bedroom. We thought it was the detergent that was used by the housekeeping so we left the balcony door open. However, after shower, the smell became so bad I started feel a shortness of breath. I called the guest service and asked for someone to check our room, thinking there was a gas leak. After the call, we waited for 15 min and there was still no one coming to check the room. I was getting angry as this was an emergency and the front office is not treating it seriously. As I was really feeling breathless, we decided to get out of the room. Upon stepping out, we met the housekeeper Arlyn. She was indeed God-sent. Immediately she took a step forward near our door and from her look, she looked shocked when greeted with the pungent turpentine smell. Immediately, she was decisive. She called the front office and changed our room to another similar room. A technician came and verified that the pungent smell came from the air con ventilation caused by renovation paint above our room. This explains why my allergy was nearly triggered off.

After moving to our new room, we were puzzled when we returned from dinner, to find a bottle of red wine with two glasses without any note on it. We suspected it was a complimentary gesture from housekeeper Arlyn but we weren't sure. We checked the mini bar for the price but it was not listed. We decided to call the reception and was sent into a journey of confusion. Reception asked if it was white or red wine and said we have to pay for it. I presented my confusion and told her that it was not listed in the menu bar. Only when I further present to her my puzzle that the bottle of Anakana red wine appeared only after I came back from dinner, did she say that she will check it and call me back. The verdict: it was complimentary and I guessed it was from housekeeper Arlyn, who wanted us to erase the bad memory of having a pungent turpentine room that triggered my allergy.

Conclusion:
When we travel, no one wish to experience unexpected unwanted events. Staying at Shangri-la Mactan is like buying an insurance. The cuts are soothed by the healing balm of experienced housekeeper like Arlyn and the invisible beach staff. The cuts can be prevented if receptions are more knowledgeable and well-trained.",Staff:Food

You wouldn't even want to go out of your room because the mattress is so comfortable, lots of pillows. The toiletries are top quality, The room interior is very Filipino, reflective of our culture. Their breakfast buffet is the only eat all you can I keep coming back to. They serve good food, with a lot of variety and i mean a lot without jeopardizing the taste. The interior of the whole hotel itself is luxurious and the staff are really nice. Everyone I see says hello or good morning or whatever they can greet me with. I was here on my birthday and when I came back to my room from swimming, I had a happy birthday cake. Yay! Also, their cafe near the lobby, has good cakes too.

But why stay at the pool, when you have a beautiful beach with colorful fish to swim in!? We had breakfast at Acqua, and they had a good selection of both western and asian food.

Our room was nice and clean. The bed was not bad, and they did use duvet cover for the blanket. The elevators are not locked though. One could freely go to any floor.

We totally enjoyed the buffet breakfast served at the Tides, though it was rather busy and crowded. We also tried the buffet breakfast at Acqua, which was a smaller buffet with limited choices if you compare it with the one served at the Tides, but it was still good and much less crowded.

Our 5 year old daughter had lots of fun she didn't want to leave! We enjoyed our stay here immensely, although one gripe is that during the busy period getting a table at breakfast was hard and breakfast buffet would run out if you went too late.

"It was my first visit to the famous Shangri-La and my expectations were very high, living in the Caribbean and being used to be a monthly guest to resort as Sandals, Hyatt, Secrets and Riu Palace.
The atmosphere of the Shangri-La is unique: the lobby and main area is simply amazing, I really loved the style and made me feel really good and comfortable, and also the staff - probably helped by being in The Philippines - was great, very careful and welcoming.
The room was quite nice but my first day has been ruined by an unpleasant episode: while showering, I have noticed that there was a giant tarantula on the ceiling and I got crazy....you can't have nasty insects in a 5 star hotel costing over 300 usd per night.
The quality of restaurants and food is really high: I have tried the Acqua having Fettuccelle with Mushroom and Truffle and I found it excellent and very tasty.
The beach is small but really nice, while the pool is amazing and it has a nice water park with slides.
I would come back for sure to Shangri-La, even if I think the price is a bit high considering that it includes only breakfast (no drinks, no all-inclusive).

"One thing that really stands out about this hotel is the service. Everyone greets you with a smile and requests are handled with a sense of urgency and care. From the check-in desk to the restaurants to the room service, I always enjoyed interacting with the staff.

The views are another thing that stand out. We stayed in the ocean wing and the view from the balcony was so nice. Then there's the view from the infinity pool which had me posting quite a bit on Instagram. As you walk around the meticulously manicured grounds you find yourself constantly saying 'wow' (ie. Pebble arrangements).

One thing they can improve upon is perhaps updating the washroom. Don't get me wrong , they're very clean, but they are showing their age. In my washroom it looked like the soap holder was broken and repaired when really it should have been replaced entirely. Another thing was the toilet which had an issue with the tank and never stop filling. So I'd have to jiggle the handle to get it to stop.

"Booked 2 rooms for my husband and me and for my parents in July. As there are not enough 5-star beachfront hotels in the area to choose from, we opted for Shangri-La.

The breakfast buffet is incredible, delicious with plenty to choose from. I liked the variety of fruits and the local dishes. Thumbs up to the staff at the restaurants who were all accommodating, professional and sought to please their clients. Having said that, dining options are quite pricey, nothing extremely special about the food but not too bad either. Shangri-La in Mactan is very exclusive and gated in a Filipino fashion. It is opulent and insulated from the relatively poor and unkempt town it’s in with no bars and reputable restaurants to walk to so there's no real competition when it comes to dining.

Now if you came for a conference or for business with a little bit of pleasure on the side like a wellness experience of some sort, Shangri-La Mactan is probably the best place to be. But if you fly in for a nice tropical beach, you will be terribly disappointed. It has a tiny beach. I had expected a stretch of white sand and seawater typical from 5-star beachfront hotels but theirs was an extremely short walk between the 2 ends of the hotel grounds, designed more for pictorials than for actual live enjoyment such as a relaxing stroll by the beach. The marine sanctuary is right by the beach and not a huge deal. Go snorkel elsewhere to see the real thing.

Other than that, the expenses just keep piling up from day 1. A lot is charged as extra such as snorkelling gears (we brought our own thankfully) and activities are way too expensive. One time, I had to purchase mobile credits from the hotel guest office. They have a fixed service charge even for selling a $2 mobile card which was ridiculous that the personnel transacting with me was apologetic. I decided to buy a lot more mobile credits than necessary to bring down the service charge to an acceptable proportion relative to the purchase.

Having stayed in 5-star beachfront hotels in the Mediterranean and vacation apartments by the beaches in Hawaii within the same price range or even less, they all had really long stretch of white sand and warm waters shared of course by a line of good hotels. As for service, those 5-star staff would hand out free small snacks by the beach daily and social cocktails in the hotel grounds weekly, daily complementary in-room desserts, daily instructor-led water aerobics and other exercises for free, and some with nightly activities like shows and live band.

That’s 5-star service and treatment, not to mention how they have to be cost efficient because they only earn in the summer months. So factoring in the relatively low labor cost in the Philippines and all-year long summer weather, Shangri-La Mactan’s €300 deal room rate should be half-pension and should do away with extra charges.

We had a friend with a one-day pass who came to spend the day with us. I thought the staff who registered her in was being needlessly strict to insist on keeping her passport throughout her stay, probably suspecting that our friend would stay overnight with us. Leaving a passport sounds overkill but thankfully, we talked the staff into keeping our friend’s ID instead. It’s a minor blip but it's really the little things that matter more than the eye-candy extravagance.

This is a mixed review, more bad points than good. But my last word for a discerning traveler is, Shangri-La Mactan does not have a good price-value relationship. Spend your money in a real 5-star service.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"Such a beautiful hotel! The beach is lovely and the water is crystal clear. There is plenty of well-kept green areas too. The breakfast buffet is also very hard to beat, and so is the service. The perfect place for a relaxing retreat. The only downside is that the hotel is a bit far away from everything, but the staff if very helpful in getting you a taxi, should you need it.",Food:Location:Staff
"Stayed 3 nights at Shangri-La Mactan (Cebu) as part of the Ironman 70.3 Cebu Triathlon accommodation package. Had to stay 1 more night here to enjoy what Cebu can offer after the triathlon sports event.

Room and customer service were excellent, and staff were very courteous and prompt.This is the 3rd year in a row that I am staying here for the Ironman triathlon but all the time, the room assigned to us has got only the view of lobby driveway (bit noisy). But they gave us very early check-in (11am) so it was fair compromise considering that I came here for a sporting event.

Buffet breakfast was good with some local cuisine on offer. Abundant choices of international cuisine too, and servers were friendly and accommodating.

Excellent clear-water beach at the doorstep with lots of activities to do. Yoga, massage are optional services. If you find the resident restaurants too pricey, there are many cheaper options with good food just along the road leading to the resort which are not too far away (walking distance).

Had to book 1 more night. We went to Oslob, Cebu some 3-4 hours away from the resort for whale shark watching/swimming and exotic island hopping experience. We booked this Oslob tour with an agent. Wish that Shangri-La can engage accredited agents for such tours, given that Cebu is known destination for Oslob Whale Shark watching. This way, transportation arrangement, food and tour payment can just be integrated.

Overall, my experience is excellent. Whenever I will be in Cebu for a holiday, Shangri-La will be among the top of my list for holiday destination.",Food:Location:Staff
This hotel is THE most beautiful hotel I've ever been to.. The setting is just perfect to sit and enjoy a perfect vacation. I would recommend the island hopping! Breakfast is to die for and the Chinese restaurant serves a delicious pork pineapple :) Go for it!,Food:Location
"So, another Christmas holiday was spent here at the Shangri-la Mactan. As has always been in the past, the service that we got from the staff was superb! After having tried the Ocean Wing last year, we again had ourselves booked here. My wife and I love the privilege of being able to have access to the Ocean Club Lounge. It's such a nice feeling to dine in the more private lounge.

This is our 4th consecutive year to spend the Christmas holidays at the Shangri-la Mactan and it has not failed to amaze us again. Our stay was as comfortable as always. Everyhing is just so ""perfect"" all the time!
It would be an injustice if I continue this review w/out mentioning some people that made sure our stay would be this ""perfect"".

It was nice to see again the smiling faces of the same people who made our stay at the Ocean Wing so beautiful last year.
Mr. Terence Perez was still there to greet us and to make sure that all the guests get the 5-star service all the time.
The charming lady, Marie, is still there...promoted just last June as Service Manager of the Ocean Wing.
Novie, an OJT, was as attentive as the others at the lounge in giving service to the guests.
It was nice to know that Rico from the housekeeping was still assigned at the Ocean Wing, and just like last year, made sure that our room was tidied up as soon as we returned.
I also have to make mention to the lady assigned to answer calls for the In-Room-Dining for making sure that our order arrived as swiftly as it can be.
Two ladies from the reservations, Ms. Bing Briggoli and Ms. Ria Mainque, communicated well with us in advance regarding our preferences as far as the types of room available for our Ocean Wing booking.

Thank you very much to all of you (including the many whose names I regretfully failed to take note of) for making our stay as perfect and comfortable as it can ever be.

Looking forward to our 5th Christmas there next year.

Happy New Year!",Staff:Food
"I stayed in Shangri-la for a week while attending a conference. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Room in Ocean wing was clean and comfortable.

"Probably the best hotel in Cebu, thou its on Mactan island. The only annoying part is getting there and exploring the rest of Cebu while staying there. I think if you were to stay at this hotel - don't leave. Really you don't have to, they have amazing food! The buffets are incredible and offer a wide variety of foods. See the Phillipines through the eyes of the Shang. The snorkeling is amazing, the beach is beautiful at night - the executive lounge is comfortable and superb. The customer experience is above excellence. However I left every day to explore the island of Cebu, a part of me wished I could have had more time to just stay and relax at the hotel. Oh the hot tub, steam room and sauna were a delight!",Food:Location
My family had a great holiday at this property. Staff were always hospitable and helpful especially to the kids.

The experience I had is awesome and I'll try to head back to this place.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I booked 3 nights in a Panorama suite in the Ocean Wing and was ""upgraded"" to a Veranda Suite in the main wing. Unfortunately the main wing felt older and was less convenient. It was a bit of a walk to get to the Ocean Club lounge and Ocean Wing pool. The suite itself was quite large and had 3 balconies and a deck with lounge chairs. The view was not the greatest, just partial ocean view and of some buildings and trees. I suspect the Ocean Wing suite would have had a much better view. Room amenities included lot of complimentary bottled water, a Nespresso machine, L'Occitane toiletries and flip-flops. WiFi was free, fast, and reliable. The included breakfast buffet offered a huge selection of western and Asian cuisine. The Ocean Club lounge was also great for snacks and beverages. The beach was small and crowded. Not too many lounge chairs available. Definitely a family friendly property and there were lots of kids around. Transfers from the airport were included although they forgot to book the departure transfer despite emailing them the details several weeks prior. The hotel is conveniently close to the airport. Overall, not as refined as your typical Shangri-La hotel but probably as good as it gets in Cebu.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This property is such a great place for a weekend getaway. You have every thing you need right there on the beautiful property. Room are great, facilities are top notch and the staff are very friendly.

"We went with my son, daughter in law and two granddaughters a few weeks ago for four days. Someone must have had special status, because someone met the van and just took us to our room - no standing in line in lobby. Great service.

The room itself is good - we had adjoining rooms, which was great. Beds were very comfortable and the noise level was very quiet.

We enjoyed the beach tremendously while we were there. Did a lot of snorkeling. The sand/water quality is very good. You can see fish if you are just standing on the edge of the shore.

The food was good. Ate at Tides a few times and enjoyed the energy there. Had fish and fries at the beach restaurant - tremendous. The drinks at the beach were not particularly good, but that is not that important to me.

This resort is large with lots to do - water slides, tennis, walking, spa, beach. The customer service is excellent. It really caters to families and there were LOTS of kids around. It was great for us since our granddaughters are 3 and 5. Blended right in.

My only complaint was the tennis center - we had to use the phone to get someone to come over and help us with rackets, etc. The first person we had didn't bother giving us a towel, water, etc., which we understood later was customary.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Stayed here several times in the past, but this time I stayed with my family. We got the deluxe sea view family room and the view was amazing!

"This hotel was perfect for a long weekend break where we wanted to relax and do very little. We were there three nights and didn’t feel the need to leave the hotel. There are a good choice of restaurants and bars, which are not cheap, but we were happy to pay for the short amount of time we were there.

We don’t have kids and while there were many children in the resort, the grounds are big enough that we managed to find spots that were a little quieter. I think it also helped that we weren’t there over school holidays.

We stayed in an Ocean Wing room which was large but maybe a little dated although this didn’t bother us. We used the complimentary shuttle bus to and from the airport which was only 15 minutes away and made the journey stress-free. The staff at the hotel were exceptional and really went above and beyond in any way they could.

I was slightly surprised by the fact that you had to pay extra for things like snorkeling sets (which you can rent by the hour, half day or full day) and for the use of the mini golf and pitch and putt course. The other water sports like jet skiing and canoeing seemed expensive to me but as a five star hotel you expect this.

Overall it was great for what we were after.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

"From the moment we checked in to the moment we left we experienced nothing but top notch service. The guest services teams were on top of our every need and i cannot speak more highly of Myles.

We had a lovely Ocean View room with a King size bed. It was perfect for my husband, 3 and 5 year old and myself. There was a sofa bed which comfortably fit both children, leaving the king size bed for us. Housekeeping matched our schedule perfectly and were able to do turn down and clean up service on demand. Which is something that is great when you have two kids.

We stayed in the resort for 6 days and i can confidently say that we didn't need to leave the resort as we actually didn't and we didn't see all of it. Adventure Zone kept the kids fully entertained, which allowed my husband and I some time to go diving and have some R & R.

If you're travelling with young children, this is a must to stay whether is for a long weekend or a week long stay.

Myles and April from Guest Services were superb and i highly recommend you seeking them out should you have any requests.

Alvin the head chef from Tides is wonderful. I am gluten intolerant and he went out of his way to ensure that he personally handled my food and when he wasn't on duty, he ensured that someone on his team was well aware of my needs.

For those wanting more quiet breakfast, I would avoid the main restaurant and opt for the smaller restaurant by the seaside. The atmosphere in the main restaurant in the mornings is quite loud and hectic, but the food is lovely, once you find it all.

In general, knowing the area, there are better spots to enjoy Philippines and the beaches, but you can never truly go wrong with Shangri-La.",Food:Location
"I stayed in a standard room (very good) for seven nights rather than an Ocean view room, which are more expensive (and since Oct 15 have their own dedicated pool). The resort has its own scheduled airport shuttle, which costs 200 pesos (about $6) each way and I recommend you pre-book it for convenience. Transit is about 20mins depending on the traffic. The resort is well-established with beautiful grounds and excellent facilities including several restaurants, gym, pitch & putt golf course, diving and snorkelling, own beach and pools (including one for children with a lifeguard). Check-in was quite swift (watch out for the credit card commitment of several 000 pesos though - it can take a while to be lifted after you leave) and there's plenty of help finding your room and carrying your luggage. The rooms are well-appointed with all the conveniences expected in a hotel of this class. WIFI is included and is very fast. The resort offers a good range of activities so you can be quite self-contained, especially for a shorter visit, which is where a resort shows its great advantages. Kids seem to love the place. Quite a few conferences/conventions were there too. Breakfast has a very wide range of fare: American, Filipino, Asian and Continental, and stocks are frequently renewed as the main restaurant (Tides) can get busy. I recommend you have a hearty breakfast because the disadvantages of resorts are they tend to be located away from other entertainment/catering sources so you pay their prices for beverages and food, which can be high especially when you realise that menu prices are pre-tax so the actual bill can be up to to 30% higher than you expected. Local beers at the main bar were about $7 after tax - imported beers about $10. Meals in the Italian restaurant were not too bad (spaghetti about $17 after tax) but the buffet in Tides was an eye-watering $80 (after tax) not including drinks so families were up for big bucks. There are restaurants across the road from the resort and we used these extensively where prices and taxes were lower. Transit to Lapu-Lapu City (30 mins) or Cebu City (up to 60 mins) requires a taxi (the shuttle has a city run) and we had a taxi to ourselves for an entire evening of wining and dining in Lapu-Lapu and transit to/from the resort for less than 400 pesos. A highlight is happy hour (2 hours) at the Aqua Bar on the beach which offers two for one cocktails, Check-out can be slow so take plenty of time before your shuttle. Please don't misunderstand me: the resort is very good and, as always, the Filipino staff are the politest and most helpful people you can ever hope to meet. But take care of the food and beverage costs and remember taxes are not on the menu but are charged on the bill.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
