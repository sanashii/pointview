"we had a wonderful and relaxing time (once work was finished) Salvador was our best friend at the pool , we didn't have to move and he sorted everything out for us. From Island transfers, to beautiful food and ease of getting around, Boracay and the Shangri-la are a great destination. People are terrific.",Staff:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We checked in today and felt this resort would be two stars at best. Our deluxe room garden view was run down and our shower wasn't working properly. There was no hair dryer to be found. We called guest service and they kept insisting there was a drawer in the bathroom. The elevator was out of order and we had to make many trips via the stairs, not an issue if we were placed at one of the higher levels.",Comfort & Facilities
"The lobby, swimming pool and private beach of the resort lives up to its expectations: very nice
Our room (301) however was a bit disappointing: damp smelling, dark and not as clean as could be expected for such a resort.
The breakfast buffet and food on the contrary were excellent, as was the view on the beach and the sunset in the evening.
Very friendly and helpfull staff.
Navette service to town.
We didn't have a room with a view but should consider to pay for the supplement when visiting this resort.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We came here for a friends wedding and everything was utterly fantastic. The staff couldn't do enough for you, the food was divine and the backdrop was awesome. We came back to visit separately to dine in the seafood restaurant and had another brilliant experience. We paid a visit to the bride & groom in their villa and the view was magnificent. The villa was stunning. I couldn't get over how amazing this hotel was. Faultless.",Staff:Food
"The resort is beautiful, it shows you a different and a special side of Boracay. Everything was excellent during our stay in the sea view delux room. One problem was the elevator that was put to preventive maintenance the next day of our visit, I had a 9 month old baby, a stroller, and a pregnant wife so it was very hard for us to manage. I complained to the hotel and when the manager approached me he offered a free upgrade to one of their pool villas which was a good response from him.

The resort has everything available for you so you wont really need to leave. A huge kids club, a medical center, salon, entertainment center, and their amazing huge pool is just out of this world.

Its highly recommended",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Great escape from the crowd in D'mall area or station 1, 2, 3. You can really enjoy your vacation on the private beach with the sound of wind and wave.
And the Solana bar is my favorite sunset bar in Boracay. Reservation are not available, first-come first-served, so it's better to be there at 5PM, then you can have the perfect seat.

比起觀光客氾濫的D'mall或Station 1,2,3, 香格里拉位置隱密，少了吵雜聲和擁擠感。飯店還獨佔兩座沙灘，ㄧ座與隔壁飯店共享，一座是私人的，不用擔心被打擾，能伴隨著海風海浪聲，慵懶地度過真正的「假期」！

還有Solana bar，是我在長灘島最愛的Sunset bar! 看夕陽，或躺或坐都行。但是不接受預位，是先到先坐制，所以建議最好在傍晚五點時就去，能優先選擇你想要的「最佳角度」。",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"From arrival at the lounge, in the boat ride, to the hotel- that is just the beginning of a real shangrila experience. The hotel and its surroundings majestic. What thought was put behind it. Every facility is relaxing, the restaurants had good cuisine, service was always warm. That is a filipino trait no other country can match. All the staff had a smile and helpful attitude. The views are like a painting. I could stay there every weekend!",Food:Staff
"My wife and I booked a suite under the ‘romantic getaway’ package. We waited till the Chinese New year is over to avoid the crowds (Chinese New year changes every year, make sure to avoid the dates. Also, avoid October 1-7 and May 1-7, the other Chinese holidays when any holiday destination is crowded, noisy and expensive).
Unfortunately, the hotel was crowded with very loud adults and noisy kids running loose without parents’ supervision, even your kids will be looking at you saying can we do the same and get away with it!
There was no escaping the noise, I had to call security two times because the kids upstairs start running from early morning till late at night, so you cannot escape to your room.
Suites are strangely located on the lower floors instead of the top floors so avoid the suites, better go for the villas, check the map so you chose the best location for the villa when making the reservation, there are one and two bedroom villas and the price is not much higher than suites.
It is not advisable booking any package except the one that includes breakfast, the dinner under the package means you get a fixed menu and you wind up with two choices you do not like and it is not in any way cheaper than if you order from the menu.
Again you cannot enjoy any romantic moment at any restaurant even Rima where the kids keep shouting as if there is a prize for being the loudest.
The package includes one treatment at the spa, you do not get to choose and you are treated as if you got a free coupon while in actual fact you paid for it in advance.
We had another treatment of our choice and it was much better choosing what suites you.
Overall the spa is ‘skin rubbing’, there is no real massage, Thai or Swedish massage. There are two spas at D- mall where you can get real good massage at a fraction of the price but the environment is nowhere close to the Shangri-La’s
Sirena, the seafood restaurant, is below expectations, best you stick with the main dining hall, Vintana, for a wide variety and safe choices. If you want seafood go to D’Talipapa downtown.

In all, the hotel is very nicely decorated, comfortable with a private beach and another shared beach, excellent service but all this is shattered by the noisy atmosphere where you cannot have a quiet moment anywhere, near the pool, at the restaurants or even in your own room.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Villa 6, it will hurt but dont think about that as your swimming in your own pool having just got your butler to run an errand for you.
Excellent service, always happy and saying hello always make you feel a little bit more welcome.
Food choice is almost too large, the room service menu could be expanded but these are tiny issues when considering a place to stay on Boracay.
Dont waste your time looking anywhere else, nowhere can compete with the beach or the location.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money
"We are extensive world travelers and I have travel advised for years. We went from the San Francisco Bay Area to the Shangri-La Boracay in February 2016 to celebrate a major birthday. Stayed 5 nights.

ROOM: The Shangri-La was kind to provide a complimentary upgrade from Deluxe Ocean View to Premier Ocean View. Michelle Mendoza in Reservations was amazing and so patient and polite to work with. We were in Room 646. To me it is all about the view and the magic. The Shangri-La delivered exactly what I had requested in a “top 6th floor corner unobstructed sweeping ocean view” room. Stunning and perfect. Though 646 was at the furthest point from the lobby of the main buildings, it was an easy walk to the lobby and we never called a buggy.
MAGIC SPOTS: Travel is often about magic spots and magic memories. The Shangri-La has a few of them which should not be missed. 1) Solana at sunset or after sunset. This is the bar side of the seafood restaurant Sirena. Solana is open at 5:30 pm – is first come, first served – has 4 booths with colorful pillows cascading down the hillside over the beach. Solana has drinks/snacks or you can also order the same full dinner menu right there as served up the stairs in Sirena. These 4 booths fill up quickly so even sitting there after sunset is magic (when those who came just for a sunset drink have left these precious four booths). 2) Rima at sunset and stay for dinner. Chic Italian. This is your “dress up night”. The pictures do not do this restaurant justice. The lighting and décor is as magical and romantic as any restaurant interior we have ever seen. Whether you get a sea facing table in the one row outdoors or one of the inside tables, I don’t think there is a bad seat in the house. Take a buggy up as it is high in the resort at the level of the rustling treetops. There is a monkey family we saw near the restaurant and the bats and birds swoop by with the sun going down. Though the restaurant opens officially at 6 pm, if you call you can go up at 5:30 pm for a pre-dinner drink and watch sunset from high above the trees then dine. Gorgeous. 3) Sitting on the beach in front of the beach bar Alon/sister restaurant Cielo. Have a happy hour drink or draft beer on tap or a bottle of something with toes in the sand and enjoy.
OTHER RESTAURANTS: 1) The breakfast buffet at Vintana is one of the best 4 resort/hotel breakfast buffets in our years of extensive travels. Maybe 20 stations – maybe 300 items. All the typical offerings in such abundance and variety plus sushi, Indian, a little Thai, Philippino. A pastry chef trained in Paris works magic with his breads. They also have for a nominal fee a bloody mary station and sparking (asti spumonti or Perrier Jouet) station. A Philippine specialty, do not miss trying the “bibingka” which is a small - hot - rich - crisp pancake like item. 2) Lunch at pool and beach side restaurant Cielo is very good. Very casual. We ate here most lunches. They also have a chef doing a daily barbeque special lunch at reasonable prices. 3) Dinner at pool and beach side Cielo/Alon. Very casual. Restaurant Cielo officially closes at 5 pm but right there beside it is bar Alon which serves dinner at the very same tables as Cielo serves lunch. The Alon bar is beautifully lite, there are baby white lights on the palm trees, and torches. We had one dinner there at Alon.
MANAGEMENT: Management is truly delightful and very interactive. 1) Shangri-La veteran Ester Marcaida is the General Manager. We were lucky to meet her immediately as she was on our incoming launch from the Caticlan airport to the resort. Her grace and joy and kindness and elegance permeates through the property. She also saw us off in our frantic unexpected departure due to a flight cancellation. 2) Resort manager Russell Dray was great to talk to and also saw us off. 3) We had many conversations with Food and Beverage Manager Keith Rajan. He is exceedingly nice and we learned so much about Boracay from him. He was also very open to any suggestions or comments we had.
STAFF: The training of the Boracay staff is exceptional on top of the lovely inherent spirit of the people. Manners, etiquette, eye contact, joy, conversation, so well done. “The people” of the Shangri-La Boracay was a clear highlight of the trip for us.
SPECIAL TOUCHES: 1) The two nights there were fireworks at the hotel for weddings, management sent a letter to let us know. The first occasion they also sent a 10+ item snack tray to enjoy while the fireworks were on. A delivery like this was a “first ever”. 2) When you leave your plate at breakfast to retrieve other breakfast buffet items, if sitting outdoors, staff comes with a mesh cover to keep it protected in your short absence. 3) If you order something at the breakfast buffet that needs to be cooked (like at the egg station), staff brings it to your table so you don’t have to wait. 4) We were there for Valentine’s Day and every lady was handed a long stem red rose. 5) We were there for my 60th birthday and we were treated to a lovely bottle of champagne by the GM and to after dinner drinks by the head of F&B (with such thanks).
SUGGESTION: We spent most of our time at the Banyugan Beach and pool – right in front of the Alon Bar/Cielo Restaurant. The main pool there is largely families and children and noisy so we went for the 2 palapas bunglows (seating for 2 each) right there – but just to the side which was a little haven and quiet. The small infinity pool at those palapas bungalows is in fact highlighted as you open Tripadvisor on this property. On the beach we just got too much sun so wanted the protection of the bungalow. These 2 bungalows could not be reserved – and were so sought after some guests were coming out and putting their items out at 5 am or 6 am we were told. The idea of setting an alarm to go put things out in the dark did not seem like a proper thing to be doing on vacation. My suggestion is to build a whole row of these palapas huts - with 2 chairs under each - lining the back side half circle shape of the beach. The other beach the Punta Bunga did not have the extensive services of the other beach, but did have service. Interesting travel note, there were extensive lifeguards at the pools/beaches.
A TRAVEL CRISIS AND THE SHANGRI-LA WAS SPECTACULAR IN HELP: Flying from California, 2 of our 4 flights on Philippine Air were cancelled with little to no notice – one on the arrival end – one on the departure end. As a team, the concierge and one of the directors of transport - Toby Allan John - helped us with nothing short of magnificence when we went unexpectedly from beachfront to checkout in only 20 minutes to frantically catch an outbound plane because of the cancellation. It was truly chaos and so upsetting to leave in 20 minutes …. but Toby took charge and made it all work. When he said with such calm and confidence “he will walk us through”, he meant it. He took us right to the airline counter – checked us in with our passports – got our boarding passes with minutes to spare – and led us as close to the gate as he could. I will never forget that kindness and service. A very difficult way to leave a long planned special week.
I always said about my trip …………..”I am going to the Shangri-La – which happens to be in Boracay, the Philippines”. Indeed, the Shangri-La Boracay made the trip for us. Deservedly, now I know why people rave about going to a Shangri-La
and we are excited for our next Shangri-La experience.",Food:Location:Staff
"If you are planning to come here to relax, don't bother. There are no adults only section in the hotel, beach, restaurant, or pools. The place was inundated with loud asian families that included grandparents and little children. Shangri-La tries to project a zen like atmosphere to get you to come here, but that is where it ends. The location, facilities were great and the staff were very helpful. The Shangri-La just needs to decide what kind of hotel they want to be and what kind of clients they want to cater to. I was the first person on their beach one morning under the shaded tent, and within one hour I was surrounded by 4 or 5 asian families, and kids were yelling, and the parents were yelling at their kids, and even grandparents would stand right in direct view in front of me yelling back and forth at the children. The life guard was oblivious and must have thought this was normal behavior in a resort of this magnitude. I finally had to get up and leave. I was told I could not have a drink in the pool, but meanwhile it was OK to have children running around unattended at the pool yelling, splashing and disturbing the peace and quiet. They even allowed blow up pool toys in the pool and found myself swimming with large alligators and whales floating in the pool. I could do this in Myrtle Beach if I wanted this experience. The buffet breakfast was excellent but again, unattended children and no adult section. One morning I observed a child sticking their finger in every cupcake and moving on with no one watching. Just trying to have a quiet breakfast was impossible as the staff was inattentive to who they sat around you and again even though you may be the first one there, you could find yourself surrounded by families of asian descent being loud all around you yelling at each other and their children. The only time you could escape and find tranquility was in your hotel room. this could truly be a great hotel, but misses on its delivery because of the clientele they have decided to cater to. Some day when I am old and gray and have grandchildren I want to pamper and let run amok, I know I could come to the Shang and have a great time, and let the other patrons worry about my party.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"My fiancee and I loved this resort. As a matter of fact, we became engaged at the very romantic Rima Restaurant on Valentine's Day. The weather was perfect. The white sand beaches are clean and uncrowded. The sea is multi-colored with emerald and turquoise hues. The dive shop offers scuba, jet skis, water skiing, snorkeling, kayaking, banana boat rides, and parasailing. The swimming pools are spectacular. I don't think it would be possible to find friendlier staff anywhere else in the world.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This is the best resort I have stayed at thus far! I felt really lucky to have such a wonderful experience.

We were on a 3 week vacation throughout Philippines and Hong Kong to visit family. I really wanted to relax and did not want to leave after our stay.

We stayed three nights and everything exceeded our expectations. We felt spoiled from the private boat transfer, breakfast buffet, even a staff member accompanied us to the Caticlan airport.

We booked a garden deluxe room and it was beautiful and the layout was well thought out.

The pool and beach was amazing. My son preferred the pool. Very family friendly. We left the resort only once; white beach was too crowded so we just stayed at the resort the rest of the time.

We only booked two nights and asked to extend the stay to another night. It was an awkward conversation with the front desk; they had to check and it took awhile for them to get back to us. I tried not to read too much with their tone with us, but this was the only negative experience with them. Otherwise the rest of the staff were rock stars and hope they get compensated well!

This was my first Shangri-La experience and it won't be my last! Our next destination was Cebu and kicked myself for not staying at the Shangri- La property.",Staff:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"This property is beautifully located with fine sandy beaches. The Hotel blended in with the local vegetation, trees and surround hills although the Architecture is not stunning
but amicable. Rooms are spacious and well equipped and although only 7 years old the furniture shows its condition! The staff are really magnificent, polite, welcoming and eager to please the guest. But the kitchen should take some cooking lessons, if they are selling International food then I expect to have that and not something else. Bother the Fish and Italian restaurant were both very good! I encounterd 1 major problem of which i advised the management but seems they prefer not to take any notice. Based on that I would say....never again ShangriLa Boracay for me it was not Paradise found but Paradise lost.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"My husband and I booked a couple of nights stay here in this amazing property. We stayed at the partial sea view room. We were also with friends who booked the loft villa. For us, it was one of the most unforgettable vacation that we ever had, albeit one of the most expensive too. But all the money was worth it. We had a butler as the other room was a villa so we had our personal assistant our entire stay who catered to all our needs. Julius was our butler and he delivered excellent service to us. Rooms are modern Filipino theme, the entire resort looks really high end. Our partial sea view room is very spacious, the bathroom was enormous! Comfortable beddings. It also has a balcony and even with the partial sea view you still have breathtaking views. The entire resort feels like a spa with the sound of flowing water when you walk around and it was not crowded at all when we were there. At some point we had the entire pool to ourselves. The beach is nice too although the sand is coarser than the one on white beach but it is empty and private unlike in white beach which is so disappointing as it looks like a mall in Manila with all the people everywhere. The loft villa was really amazing. The view up there is really awesome, overlooking the resort. The loft villa's infinity pool with that gorgeous view is our favorite spot, we were so depressed when we left. Breakfast buffet is also very good. There is a buggy ride that can take you anywhere in the resort. Transfers to and from the resort to the main island and airport are also hassle free because they have their own. Lastly, I really commend the staff for delivering exemplary first class service. Kudos to all of you. We only go home to the Philippines one a year and we are thinking of going back to shangri la again next year.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"The Shangri-la at Boracay may be the most beautiful resort I've ever stayed at in my life, and I've visited more than a dozen countries, and I've stayed at 5 star resorts in the U.S. that are frequented by Congressmen, celebrities, and the occasional President. Yes, the Shangri-la at Boracay really is as nice as any of these places!
The rooms are awesome! The beach is beautiful! My son can't spend enough time in the pool, and when I joined him I saw why. It's perfect!
The landscaping is gorgeous and well kept. Every time you pass an employ they great you with a ""Good afternoon (morning, evening, etc.) Sir,"" with a smile on their face. They have been excellently trained and are very respectful.
However, the front desk girls probably shouldn't be there.
When we checked in, and I gave the front desk girl my paypal debit/credit card, she asked me if it was debit or credit. I told her it was both, but to please run it as credit, because I'm in the 1% cash back rewards program for when the card is run as a credit card, and I ALWAYS take advantage of that option. She very flippantly said to me, ""Sir, if this is a debit card, I need to run it as a debit card so the cash comes out of your account."" I explained to her it would come out of the account whichever way she ran it, but to run it as a credit card so I'd get my 1% cash back. She went on that ""Here in the Philippines,"" diatribe, that basically means, ""we do things the way we want, whether it's how it really works or not, and whether you like it or not."" Since I was staying for several days, and was paying quite a pretty penny to do so, I insisted she run it as a credit card so I'd get my 1% cash back. She still refused, and I had to demand she run it as a credit card. She then said, ""You know what? I have all afternoon. I'll call my manager."" She then wasted another ten minutes of my time to call her manager, only to find out she could run it as a credit card, which she did, so I got my 1% cash back, and then she proceeded to tell me that I needed to check my account online to see that the cash came out of the account and that I was wrong in my understanding of how my account worked. SERIOUSLY!
Five nights later, we decided to extend for another night. I mean, this place really is that good. We dealt with a different front desk girl. She told me the price, I handed her my card, and she said, ""Sir, just sit for a while,"" and pointed at the chair. We'd just eaten dinner and I was full as could be, and I said, ""No, I'm okay, I'll just stand."" She stopped what she was doing, glared at me, and very flippantly said, ""Are you in a hurry?!?"" I said no. I just don't want to sit down. This isn't going to take six months is it? She then saw that my domestic partner doesn't share my last name (we've been together 6 years and have a five year old son, who happened to be with us), and she started referring to my partner as Miss (insert her last name here), in an obvious attempt to point out to my partner that we were not married. Neither of us care about this, but the thing is, we don't feel anyone else really has any right to do so either.
This resort is premier. It is really worthy of a 5 star recommendation. I would give it one if they got rid of a few ""Miss Thangs"" at the front desk or simply retrained them. I understand much of this is cultural, as I've lived in this country for six years as an exp-pat. I am NOT a tourist. But when I pay in excess of ph 30,000 a day (lodging plus food and expenses) for a place this nice, I expect universal professionalism to trump cultural pettiness. I've been in the Philippines long enough to know you simply have to ignore much of the culture, but when I pay this price at a 5 star resort, there should be nothing like this to have to ignore.
Again, the rest of the Shangri-la is perfect. I could not ask for better. But ph 30,000 a day is a hell of a lot of money to pay to receive flippant attitude front desk staff.",Staff:Value for money
"Shangri-La was a stunning property, one of the nicest I have ever seen. Two semi-private beaches with crystal blue waters filled with tropical fish and coral. The treehouse villa was spectacular with an amazing ocean/sunset view.

CONs:
The worst part of the stay...
Our first butler told us that all water sports were included with the villa. We quickly signed up to Try Scuba Dive and after our training and open water dive, they asked us to pay ~$400. We explained that we were in a villa and our butler said scuba, parasailing, snorkeling, etc were all included. They did nothing to rectify the situation and made us pay them. Major complaint.

Aside from the beautiful breakfast buffet, the alcoholic drinks, and one Indian dish at Ventana, the food was far below average and costs A LOT compared to the food anywhere in town. EAT ELSEWHERE, anywhere else. Try Smoke or Cyma or anything not at this resort.

Hygiene concerns with the young girls at Scotty's Watersports center on the resort. On more than one occasion, I was in a stall or at a sick when one of the employees would be using the restroom. Not once did they bother to wash their hands or even use hand sanitizer. Wipe-n-go is gross...and I think that goes beyond my personal cultural upbringing.

HIGHLIGHTS:
Meryem aka Mem, our scuba instructor made learning scuba diving one of the best things we ever did and she took great care of me when I became incredibly seasick, and then some. Her talent in diving and teaching puts her way ahead of the rest.

Rome, our kayak guide, explained a lot to us about the island and tailored the experience to our skill levels and interests.

Erwin, our replacement butler when ours was sick, enhanced our stay greatly with courtesy and extra consideration.

Reynold (we think that was his name), the buggy driver, was fabulous. He had us laughing all the time and really made each ride a good experience.

I would stay again, but would not buy the food at the resort and I would also question ""free"" or ""included"" things.

The doctor, Dr. Palacay, is nice enough but needs more medical training. She botched my IV twice and the second was excruciating. She also didn't know that my ovaries are in the lower abdomen, not the middle.

I hope management works on improving these weaknesses quickly.",Staff:Food
I was there with a group of friends and we enjoyed the resort a lot. The two beaches are great with the addition of a pool and they all have amazing views of the sunset.

"We've stayed at hundreds of lodging facilities from hostels to vacation rentals to several 5-star resorts the world over and the Shangri-la Boracay is one of our top five ever.

It's everything you'd expect and much more from a 5-star resort - a more secluded, private location on the other end of Boracay Island far away from the busy tourist bustle; exquisitely appointed rooms with plenty of eco-friendly amenities; a large fitness facility with plenty of current equipment; an extensive daily breakfast buffet with a changing menu (it would take a few days to sample everything from just the mainstay dishes); several daily activities available for guests; beautiful infinity pools throughout the property; two clean, private white sand beaches just steps from every room/villa (with plenty of available lounge chairs even in high season); the wonderfully relaxing Chi spa; a large kids club with many fun options and affordable babysitting; etc.

*I could go on on all the positives, but the thing that sets the Shangri-la Boracay apart from all the rest worldwide is it's outstanding service and personnel. After six trips to the Philippines I'll have to attribute this to the world renown genuine Filipino hospitality with a touch of great customer service training. But the staff here is so genuinely friendly, nice, and can anticipate your every need.

Every day my wife and I talk about how great this place is, but already on our third day here, because of the wonderful staff, it just keeps getting better! Examples: Mark being so kindly welcoming at the front reception area at check-in (and remembering us throughout our stay- our kids even ask for him!); a staff member from the kids club remembering our little boys from earlier in the morning and finding them in the afternoon while we were on the beach then offering and taking them down the way to with her to build sand castles so that my wife and I could relax; the manager, nurses and security immediately rushing over and helping our young son after he had a minor accident here the other night and then following up with us the following day when they saw us walking in person; and EVERY staff member genuinely greeting us in passing or asking us about our day and offering their assistance. It's seriously the best GENUINE customer service ever without being even mildly overbearing or pressed/questionable (as we've encountered in some other 5-star resorts).

The only potential drawbacks I've encountered is the signature fish dish at one of their three main restaurants, the seafood-themed Sirena, was way too salty and cooked on a bed of chunks of salt that appear to look just like French bread (don't make the mistake that I did and accidentally take a bite of it!). The fish and prawns there were also a bit overcooked (we mentioned it to our server). Overpriced in my opinion. Also, if you're looking for complete privacy on the property, then you'll probably only get it in your room because it looks like every inch of common area space here is covered by a surveillance camera. It's great for security and assistance (about 6 personnel including a nurse came within 30-60 seconds of my son's accident; also, when it looked like no attendant was nearby, a gym staff member immediately rushed in while I was searching for one for about 20 seconds to help program a treadmill), but just keep this in mind.

Overall, the Shangri-la Boracay is one of the BEST 5-star resorts we have ever stayed at and we give it our HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. We look forward to returning here again hopefully sometime soon!",Staff:Food
"In total we spend 10 nights at this hotel end of December 2015. This scenic hotel resort is located at the Northern tranquil and secluded part of Boracay Island. Arriving with the private boat shuttle was a fun and unique experience. The hotel offers 2 beautiful sandy beaches with direct access to the stunning and crystal blue sea. Despite the pristine location, we had to struggle to get sunbeds as the beach as the hotels does not seem to have enough sunbeds and umbrellas in stock. It was a daily hassle which we did not enjoy very much. The gorgeous sunsets and the genuine smiles of the staff made up for it. We did not use any of the pools, so I cannot comment on those areas. Also organise a private beach dinner as this was a truly memorable experience for us.

The restaurants offer different types of food; especially Rima on the tree tops is a great place. We celebrated our NYE's dinner here and enjoyed it very much. The texture of our menu was divine and we really enjoyed all courses.

The SPA blew us away; the location and their treatments in private villas are worth every penny. I also used the gym frequently which is really great.

In general service was ok, not great, even though we felt that all staff members were committed to doing their best - it seems to be more the inefficient organisation surrounding them that is impacting the staff's ability to deliver.

On the whole a very good stay; would have given excellent rating if service levels would be up to par with hotel star rating and the beach offering enough sunbeds for all their guests.",Food:Staff:Location

The Shangri-la is well sited in a stunning, secluded corner of the island away from the busy main stretch. The resort is well designed, beautifully landscaped, and well kept. There are gorgeous views all over the resort. There is some wear and tear, but that is inevitable in this climate. The service throughout the resort was very good and consistent. Boracay in general is a stunning beach destination but the private beach at the Shang was like my personal beach paradise. They also have a larger beach that is technically not private but it seemed empty most of the time.

Traveling to Boracay is an adventure in itself. If you fly into Kalibo, you will need to drive for a scenic but windy 90 minutes and then take a boat to reach Boracay. We arranged private transport with the Shangri-la. It was absolutely worth it to pay the premium for this seamless service. We were met at the airport, driven in a private van with water and wifi provided in the car, and then dropped off at the resort's private boat launch so we could take the Shang's speedboat directly to the resort. While waiting for the boat, we were provided cool drinks in a well appointed lobby like area with nice bathrooms.

Our deluxe room was well decorated in a tasteful, tropical luxury style. I really like how the Shangri-la always seem to have a large bench where you can easily put your suitcases. The bathroom was large with double sinks, a standalone tub, and separate toilet and shower. We were a bit annoyed that the door to the toilet room within the bathroom was transparent glass, but it is a minor quibble. We appreciated that the Shangri-la provided purified drinking water in glass bottles that were automatically replaced every day since the water from the tap is not safe for drinking or teeth brushing.

This resort has the best kid's club we have ever experienced. There is a giant slide that goes into a ball bit, a climbing area, a toy area, TV, and tables and chairs. There are also scheduled activities throughout the day. My son asked to spend hours there, which we happily obliged. He found playmates that he also played with at the pool. It was truly a vacation for the parents! Next to the kid's club is an entertainment center with pool tables, a bar, computers, and TVs for older kids. We also spent a lot of time in the pool area, which is very attractive and nicely designed. There were many lifeguards, which is important if you have kids.

The breakfast buffet is quite good. There is a wide variety of both Asian and Western food and several on demand cooking stations. We loved the Filipino food offered, especially the Lechon and babimkas. We also loved Kiki, the fruit bat mascot. Try to get a table at the Solana (next to Sirena) for drinks at sunset - it has the best view on the resort. Sirena, the seafood restaurant, was quite good but the Vintana Cafe was just ok and empty for many nights. I would suggest eating in town for dinners apart from Sirena. We did not eat at Rima so cannot assess it. We thought the dinner choices at the Shangri-la Rasa Ria in Borneo was much better in terms of variety and taste.

Overall, we had a fantastic family vacation at the Shangri-la Boracay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Shangri-la Boracay is truly a tropical paradise! It might have rained when we visited, but it certainly did not diminish the fun and luxury that we had for 3 days! They gave us a bottle of wine to celebrate our anniversary and gave us the the best signature Shang service!

They have international crew members and personnel who are really friendly and attentive to your every single need. The pools are amazing very well-maintained.

Not one part of this resort did not shout 'paradise'.",Staff:Food
"This is a very good hotel. But it is the little things that make a hotel great and this property fell just short for me. That said although I travelled alone this time I would consider going back with my family (2 young kids) as it is a great family hotel. The positives of this hotel have been laid out in depth in other reviews so what needs improvement?

1) I stayed in a garden view deluxe room and to be frank the wing I was in was looking very tired. To the hotels credit it was doing some renovations (so there were workmen wandering around), thankfully it was not noisy or intrusive. Some of the marks on the walls and floors in the public areas however where not up to Shangri-la standards. The room was nice and big but again was starting to show a bit of wear and tear. Believe it or not I am not that fussy but I know some of my friends I usually travel with would not have been impressed! I didn't see in one of the villas, they may be much better.

2) Maybe it was because I was travelling alone so I wasn't a ""priority"" (I was there 4 days and think i saw 2-3 weddings on the property in that time) but service did seem a little slow sometimes. Not a big complaint but there were one or two times when I though ""okay I will just do it myself"" rather than trouble the staff.

I would agree this is a very good hotel. The Dive centre was fantastic for example, beach and pool area really good. It could be outstanding with just a little bit more attention to detail and I would go back again. But for someone like me who is not too fussy to notice these things you would expect better if you are paying US$400-500 a night for a room.

Oh one last thing, not sure if this is normal (and not really a Shangri-la issue) but beware booking the late afternoon flights out of Caticlan airport which is the main gateway to the hotel. A number of the later flights were cancelled (ours included), they said the runway does not have lights so if flights delayed out of Manila they can't land post sunset! This happened to us and sleeping on a airport floor because of a missed connection is one way to lose you holiday vibe very quickly! Note the transfers from airport to Shangri-la are first class, big thumbs up to the resort logistically for that.",Comfort & Facilities
"At the beginning of May we stayed in a Tree House Villa on the hillside overlooking the sea, the beach and surrounding trees and not overlooked by neighbours. With a balcony complete with spa, a kitchenette and huge dining / living room and downstairs a master bedroom and en-suite to die for - this was indeed not only luxurious but paradise. We had our own dedicated attendant on call. The food and the facilities at the resort including a wonderful spa massage were top quality - far better than I ever imagined for the Philippines. A ten minute drive away from the night life of Boracay centre - it was a truly memorable stay and I fully intend to return. Everything - the grounds, rooms facilities are so well maintained and all the staff are friendly and knowledgeable and obviously well trained by the Shangri-La Group. This is one of their jewels and is highly recommended.",Food:Staff:Location
"Spent New Year in a Pool Villa. Spacious ,well furnished villa and fairly private with great view. Unheated private pool.great staff and willing to serve
Expensive but worth it - breakfast buffet about the best I have seen for a long time. Logistics from Manilla bit complicated but handled well by Shangri-La staff with the bonus of an in villa check in and out- super break but Boracay very small and crowded and not really of great interest except the beautiful beach. Resort is something special and worth the long trip from Europe.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"My wife and I stayed at the Shangri-la Boracay from Dec 9 through Dec 12. This resort is located in the north-western part of the island and is fairly secluded from the hub-bub of the island. We had a room facing the ocean that gave us breathtaking views from our room. The beach was pristine with crystal clear water. The pool area was a bit crowded. The staff was extremely friendly and always willing to help.

Our best experience was with Keith Rajan, the Food and Beverage Manager and Chef Hamid. The Chef Hamid prepared a private meal that was not on the menu for us by the beach. My wife was able to watch him prepare her entrée, it was one of the best meals my wife and I have enjoyed. The personal attention was unprecedented. It was really a great treat.",Location:Food
"We stayed for for five nights over the busy new year period as part of our honeymoon. This was definitely a highlight for us (see reasons why below!) but firstly, a few tips/ words of warning...

The place is very kid friendly (I imagine a total treat for kids, even I was jealous of the adventure/kids zone), but that meant it was packed with kids. This actually wasn't as much of an issue as I first thought it might be, but worth bearing in mind. Note we came during school holidays too...

The check-in/out process is a bit painful although if you know the deal then I suspect it's less frustrating. It requires a separate flight to Caticlan, then a shuttle, then a boat which all feels a little like you are on an average tour and not going to a five star resort. The airport itself is a crazy mess and there is a sign for a Shangri-la departure lounge but then we were told it doesn't exist and it was basically standing room only. Not fun.

Also the beaches at the hotel itself are quite pebbly (ok nothing the hotel can really do) but it did take away from the enjoyment. And there were often not enough loungers with people placing their belongings and leaving for half a day so other people can't use them. The Shangri-la supplied additional loungers on some days and not others - they should really ensure there is enough on all days.

Also a few of the activities (tennis, kayaks) incur additional charges which was a bit annoying (and unnecessary with the total cost being paid).

Ok now the good stuff...

Rooms
We had one of the more basic rooms rather than splurge for the villa as we thought we wouldn't spend much time in the room. We were right and the room was spacious enough and in the main building so quite convenient too.!

Food
The food overall was good but not great. It wasn't cheap but I didn't think it was ridiculously expensive either (by UK standards, expensive by Philippines standards). The breakfast had an OK selection, points for fresh juice! Highly recommend the private beach dinner (ended up around £250 for two with drinks, so not cheap) but it was beautiful and the service was spot on. Order drinks before if you can as these are a little slow otherwise (they have to go back to the bar to get them each time). The private beach dinner was a highlight for us!

Spa
Not cheap, but very good, probably one of the best massages I've ever had. There is also a private pool here so if you want to get away from the kids, make use of the spa pool before or after your treatment. It was always very quiet. We also did the complimentary couples massage class which was fun, here's hoping my husband remembers his new skills when we get back home.

Complimentary classes
Surprised more people don't do these. I did the cardio circuit and pilates and was the only person in the class - but both were really, and Jason the instructor was great. We also did the kayak adventure and couples massage also. There's quite a number of good things on offer that are free.

Service
Hands down this has to be the most friendly, helpful service we've ever had and what pushed this to a five-rating. You really get the sense that the Shangri-la treats their staff well and people are happy to work here. I can see some ""western"" frustrations as when things don't quite work out reactions aren't perhaps what we would expect (or do). However my experience was that the staff would always try their best to do what you asked and were very friendly about it. For example, when I turned up at 8am for my Pilates class only to find out the schedule i'd been given was wrong the response was (what I felt) a slightly indifferent ""sorry"". Being a bit annoyed having got up extra early and eaten breakfast to attend the class, I asked if they could organise a separate class given the mix up and being unable to make the actual time later that day. They had this sorted within an hour (free of charge). Lesson - if you ask they will bend over backwards to help, but you may need to ask.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"A group of us - around 40 people - visited Boracay for a week to celebrate New Year.

With the exception of me the group is essentially one big family, and they treat and regard me as family, and we all live in Manila.

Head of the family are our beloved seniors, both in their 70's, and we're so close that I call them mum & dad, and they refer to me as their adopted son!

They have visited Boracay many times over the years and it's always been their dream to visit the Shangri La. Therefore, instead of buying them a Christmas gift that they don't need, I gifted them lunch as this wonderful resort during our stay on the island.

I called the day before, spoke to the duty manager and booked a table. I so explained that dad isn't walking so well and a wheel chair was arranged amd waiting with the concierge upon our arrival.

From the greeting to the service throughout lunch, the staff were as you would expect, outstanding; full attention to detail but without being overbearing.

The food was perfect; dad had the Bulalo, said it was wonderful and that's no easy acheivement!

After lunch we looked around and every time I was taking a photo of mum & dad a member of staff would come over and offer to take another with me in the picture too.

I was a professional pianist for many years, and I would like to pay particular thanks to the Director of F&B for arranging and allowing me to play the piano in the lobby bar before we left. That gave mum amd dad the perfect ending to what was a perfect couple of hours.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at this property over the first week in december, and what a truly exceptional property it is. We are not able to express our gratitude fully to the hotel and staff who made it a truly memorable stay for us.

We were very fortunate to stay in loft villa number 25 for three nights which sits at the top of the hill in the forest the property occupies. The villas are spectacular - a huge upstairs with massive bed, huge bathroom, walk in wardrobe and balcony, and a downstairs with a kitchen, spacious living room and wonderful terrace with private pool and daybeds, plus an outside rainfall shower.

The villas are also isolated, so you have total privacy, and can spend the day in and around your villa only to be roused by a member of the villa team bringing you fresh fruit/pastries/water etc etc. You have an on call butler, should you require, and even if you don't call them, they are so attentive they will go out of their way to do things for you. Eric, Julius and Lee were responsible for the villas, and on mentioning that of course we didn't have any monkeys swinging through trees in London when told there were monkeys in the forest, Eric called us out of the blue one afternoon at 5 o clock to tell us that the monkeys were outside and for us to come out and see them...Small, attentive details which define this property!!!

We then stayed in a sea view room for the last two nights of our stay. Whilst smaller, the same attention to detail we saw in the villa was evident in this room. Lovely furnishings, warm decor and well planned use of space ensure you will be exceptionally comfortable and with a view to match!

To understand the scale and performance of the breakfast and the team that make it so wonderful no words can do it proper justice. We have been fortunate to stay in some wonderful properties around the world, but you will have to go a long way to find something that rivals this. There are around 10 chefs at different stations, preparing everything you can possibly imagine for every different tastebud. Western, Arabic, Pan-Asian, Filipino, Sushi, it is incredible. The chefs are so attentive they even remember what you like or ordered the day before they will prepare it for you the next morning and make it seem like you are the only guest there. For a big property it never seems busy, particularly at breakfast because logistically, it has been so well organised and the space so well managed.

The pool(s) are beautifully clean, spacious, and the beaches sandy and private, and the spa is also hugely impressive...a wonderful building on the edge of the resort, in lush gardens and buildings, absolutely no expense spared. The gym is superb, the restaurants also, and the whole property exudes calm and tranquility.

The stand out point though is the quality, kindness, efficiency and willingness to go out of their way to please you attitudes of the staff...you get a hello from EVERY member of staff from the manager to the gardeners, and what stood out for us was the Shangri-La commitment to employing, training and giving the opportunities to local people. Many staff had been there since opening, and you can see the resonance of the Shangri-La's investment in their people from the warm atmosphere the staff create all over. An example of this is Salvador, who works on the beach, who is deaf. If you watch him, you can see his desire/work rate/positive attitude and warm heart towards making sure the guests are looked after and at the drop of a hat...A wonderful epitome of what we experienced throughout our stay.

No words can do justice what we experienced and I can only say you must go there to experience it for yourself. I only hope you will experience all this and more!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"This is the BEST resort in the island! I've been to a lot of resorts, hotels, and all sorts of accommodation in Boracay and this is the BEST!

Shangri-La are good for couples on honeymoon and families who wants peace, quiet and relaxation in Boracay. The resort is very far from the nightlife and happy beach life of Boracay; and it's situated in the northern part of the island. The hotel has its own bars and restaurants which offers good food and good booze.

Shangri-La also provides top-notch service and excellent accommodation. Each room has a veranda and a day bed where you can lounge and rest. Shangri-La in Boracay is one of the BEST resorts I've been. World-class.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Compared to other 5 star resorts this one is good, but not really as they call it themselves ""welcome to paradise"". Pick up and transfer from and to the airport and the hotel was perfect and also the check in was fine. Rooms were good en the lay out and atmosphere of the resort is very nice. The resort is a bit in the middle of nowhere, but they offer a free shuttle to station 2 (D'Mall) and if you prefer to stay in the resort they have different options to wine and dine. All in all it was good, but.......

When you go for breakfast you have to wait in line for a table. Esp. when you have a family of 6 you need to wait. Staff and management are unwilling to put two free tables to each other (no clue why, but seems they are instructed not to do so....). Same for a beach chair. Seems they offer less chairs than number of guests. But if you don't mind to be spread out over the pool and beach it might be OK. Lunch at the beach bar is also a challenge. Staff is friendly and they do their best but it is all not well organised; not able to serve 6 dishes at the same time or even 6 drinks...... Unfortunately we were also confronted with clothes stolen from our room. We reported this, were told they would investigate, but they didn't report back. After we asked again they asked us to whom we reported this. We didn't know the persons name at reception, so no clue. And due to this they couldn't do anything......?!

All in all not what we expected and hoped for. So this one is off the list. We have had better Shangri La experiences.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"We had a romantic escapade for two days at the Shangri-la Resort. It was marvelous! Our over all rating for this resort is 8/5. 20th heaven on earth.

From the time we contacted them by email, the staffs had been very professional, prompt and accommodating in responding to all our queries, they made sure that no emails had been left unanswered. And to the very moment we arrived at the Caticlan Airport, it already exceeded our expectations, there were a valet who welcomed us warmly, and personally took care of our luggage and brought us to a Shangri-la's minivan right outside the airport to bring us to the Shangri-la seaport lounge where we waited for the speedboat to take us by the sea along with their few other clients directly to the resort in few minutes, around 10 to 20 minutes or so. The staffs in the seaport lounge welcomed us with some glasses of water and wet towels to refresh ourselves and of course with their genuine smiles and friendliness. And the waiting was not long, we would say 5 minutes and we were already advised that we were set to go. And all the staffs were very attentive to us and really made sure that we were safe of getting into the speedboat and the speedboat crews were as nice as the others. Then arriving in the resort, we were welcomed again warmly and this time even more overwhelming as we got a personalized welcome by a beautiful & charming receptionist Lourdes and friendly and jolly buggy driver Arnel who brought us to the reception hall where we got to be checked-in by Lourdes on a comfortable couch with 2 glasses of fresh pineapple juice. The most relaxing hotel check-in we ever experienced. Lourdes went extra miles to make our arrival the most overwhelming and unforgettable one. Having learned also that in next couple of years we are planning some event in their resort, Lourdes introduced to us right away to another beautiful lady Holly, the nicest and best event organizer. Both Lourdes & Holly eagerly listened to us, planned with us and laughed with us, these ladies are meant to be part of this 5 star resort. The pleasant moment didn't stop there...

We had a chance to see the Villas in relation to our future plan, and we will surely book one of the villas next time because they are really great, superb and clean. Although, we really don't have any regret of taking this time the deluxe room, because it's already marvelous, the room was spacious, the setting is cozy and fully equipped with functional amenities. The bed is wide and comfortable. We found everything perfect.

We had booked the offer “Romantic Getaway”, inclusive of daily breakfast at Vintana, round-trip land and speedboat transfer from Caticlan Airport, a private romantic dinner at Rima and a 30 min Philippine “Hilot” Massage for two at CHI, The Spa. The rate for this offer was more than worth. We had wonderful moments on our breakfasts in Vintana, the whole team of “Rogie” were very attentive, friendly and accommodating to us, they even surprised us during our breakfast on the our last day with a tray filled with Philippine delicacies. Our romantic dinner at Rima, was simply amazing and staffs also surprised us with a unique Filipino dessert :), thank you. The 30 min massage was excellent.

The resort is a pretty huge property, with its beautiful design and settings. What is amazing, is the fact that Shangri-la, without compromising the comfort of the clients, managed to integrate and blend nature and wildlife into the resort thus making it even more beautiful, modern and classy.

We congratulate the resort's management for having chosen wonderful staffs, because, they are really of quality, efficient at the same time relax, smiling and friendly. It's not only the beauty of your resort that makes it paradise, it's also your staffs. Thank you much, our experience still and will always makes us smile.

We will take our huge and long share of paradise again.",Staff:Food
"Overall we had a great experience in the Shangrila Boracay. The location is stunning, with two beautiful beaches, , stunning gardens and pool area. Largely the food was very good and the spa definitely 5 star. To my delight the wifi was free, automatic and extended to all of the open areas including the beaches.
All things are relative and the thing to remember is that this without a doubt is the best in Boracay ( that said we only went to white beach station 1,2,3 once) but if you measured it against resorts in the Maldives, Mauritius or any of the 4 seasons properties, it does fall a bit short. Service could be improved, particularly with the guest services staff and in parts with food & beverage staff. We had a beautiful villa but on closer inspection it was a bit ""tired"" and generally needed a bit of a refresh.
There were however many highlights not least 3 or 4 specific staff who really went out of their way to go the extra mile. In particular was one of the pool staff Salvatore who really was a gem. The property is stunning and the views and sunsets are amazing. The transfer from airport to resort was also good and definitely necessary.
I would definitely recommend this if you are within the Far East area or travelling around that part of the globe",Location:Food:Staff
"Stayed there from November 28-30, 2015.
From the airport, we were picked up by their to the port which is just few minutes (not more than 5 minutes i think) drive. At the port, their lounge was already impressive. We waited for few minutes and was offered refreshments and a white hand towel for cleaning up. It wasn't long before their speed boat came to transport us to the island.

Shangri-la's location is far from the main Boracay with stations 1,2, and 3.

Our room which was the Deluxe Seaview has this awesome view of the sea and I had the chance to watch one of the most amazing sunsets I ever experienced.

They have this variety of food for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. They have better choices compared to the Shangri-la hotels here in Manila. I love their fruit buffet during breakfast. The fruit carvings were so nice. :) Unfortunately, the mango I tasted was not that sweet.

Went parasailing and that experience was just as awesome as our stay!

The amenities, the restaurants, as well as the service of the staff were just the best.

One thing I noticed though, the sand there is not as fine as that on the other side of Boracay. :)",Food:Location

"Shangri-La Boracay is one of the best hotels the Philippines has to offer and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with them. It is not searingly 5 stars like Ritz Carlton hotels in other countries, but I believe it's indicative of the country itself. This hotel is the closest to that level as you're ever going to get and the best hotel that Boracay offers, so I'm not going to knit-pick like some others love to do. I arrived at the small airport and right away a Shangri-La Rep is easily spotted to welcome you. Once all Shangri-La guests are collected, you're whisked in a private airconditioned van to the hotel's private dock area in Caticlan, called their Mabuhay Lounge. While all other saps are sweating on outside lines waiting in confusion for random boats they rent, Shangri-La hotel is one out of only 2 hotels that has a private indoor dock lounge in Caticlan. You're given refreshments in the indoor lounge with flatscreen tv and magazines while you wait for the hotel's private speedboat,then you're whisked away directly to the hotel's private dock in Boracay (at other hotels, you have to find your own way on the island to your hotel once the boat you rent lands in some random area). Even at the dock, Shangri-La doesn't want you to have any worries so there are long golf buggies to drive you from the boat directly to the front desk area of the hotel! Once at the hotel, I was given delicious cold lemonade in a mini glass carafe with a flower on its basket base, while the front desk girl logged me in and gave me keys. It was a very seemless welcoming experience compared to what I would have experienced at another Boracay hotel. The hotel staff seems to be handpicked for their natural warmth and friendliness. The room was large (not Euro cramped) and had a luxe feel with seperated marble tub, shower, and toilet.. locks to the sliding bathroom doors if you need them, really good (free) internet speed compared to the rest of the Philippines, really good complimentary buffet breakfast, eggs how u like it, full American breakfast offerings, as well as philippine dishes like adobo, kare kare, pancit, etc every morning. There is even a cute little fire dancing show on their private beach every night at 6pm. The pool is large and snakes across a big area towards a bar, but you never need to go in that area if you have kids, where they have a separate pool too if u prefer. The private beach is only a few steps beyond the end of the pool, if you prefer a grassy area, they have that too with several comfy bed lounges, while on the beach, there are several umbrella loungers for everyone, with drinks service optional. Snorkel gear and towels are readily available, kayaks and everything else needs to be requested by the onsight beach rep. The free shuttle to D'Mall in Station 2 leaves the hotel every hour on the hour and picks up at Station 2 every :20 minutes after the hour, it was extremely convenient. Station 2 is a zoo. It's loud and 10 people deep right before the water. Technically, I feel Station 2 water and sand is prettier than anywhere else on the island, but you would have to endure such chaos on their non-boardwalk storefront areas that I just wouldn't want to actually stay/sleep anywhere near there. Everytime you com back to Shangri-La after going to Station 2, you breathe a sigh of relief at the peace and luxury in comparison. Their CHI spa is pretty amazing too. I don't think I've ever felt more relaxed. I'm pretty picky regarding basic comforts and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Boracay other than Shangri-La hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

We even got to know the buggy drivers and by the end they all knew what villa we were going to, a special thanks to Rodel who was a gem.

"This has been the best hotel resort experience I've had in the entire world. Everything was perfect from the airport pick-up, check-in, activities, rooms, food, etc.

Spent many hours just swimming in the pools taking in the view of the ocean and soaking up the sun. Alon Bar has great cocktails (I recommend the Manila Sunshine) and becomes a watering hole for all the guests come Happy Hour (5-7pm). They also serve great pizza by the pool.

Lounging by the beach is a perfect way to spend an afternoon. There are complimentary snorkel masks available so you can see the small coral beds just off the beach.

When you're tired of the pool and beach (though I can't imagine anyone would be), you can relax in the entertainment center. There are pool tables, tables tennis, video games, computers, air hockey, foosball, karaoke, basketball shooting games, a screen projector and a small library.

"My husband and I stayed at the hotel for a week in March. We came here for a relaxing seaside escape after a hectic week in India. And we were quite disappointed with the whole experience. The location is beautiful but unfortunately the serenity was completely disturbed by the revolving door of weddings, conferences and birthday parties that the hotel hosted on every night our stay. Blaring music and loud speeches until very late at night was not something we had expected to deal with. The events usually start in the afternoon near the beach, so you're disturbed there. One afternoon we tried to find some peace by spending an afternoon sitting on our balcony. If we weren't paying so much for the room in the first place the loud clash of wedding music on one side and different music from a conference on the other side would have been funny. It wasn't though. The management acknowledged it was a problem but there was nothing actually done about it. The restaurants were overpriced given the quality of the food. Definitely recommend getting the hotel shuttle into town to have lunch and dinner. The staff were very friendly and the beach is nice but think you can do a lot better for your money elsewhere.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"This is perhaps one of my favorite trip of all time, come on is the Shangri-la. My husband surprise me by getting a suite at the Tree-Villa. To get to the resort, a boat is waited for you at their pick up spot. Once you arrived you are then brought to your rooms by the golf carts. The resort basically sit on its own island. Once we arrived to our villa, our butter greeted us kindly with personal cell phone which we can call anytime, we even have our own private jacuzzi on the balcony! The bedroom is located on the bottom floor with a view of the ocean and the jungle. They even provide a small beach bag which I can carry with me onto the beach ( the little details matter). My husband even surprise me with a private dinner on the beach with our very own chef cooking for us. It is the most amazing experience ever. It is on the expensive side but hey, you get what you paid for.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"First time in Boracay and I am happy I had the opportunity to stay in Shangri-la.
Everything was a breeze, from the airport to the Shangri-la lounge (wifi, clean washroom, fresh towels and water) to the boat (approx 10 minute boat ride from the airport to the hotet) and check in. I stayed at the Treehouse Villa and was lucky that the room was ready as soon as I got in. The Treehouse villa had a perfect view of the beach. We felt that we did not have to leave the resort because everything you needed were there. The complementary breakfast is actually a breakfast buffet with many selections. Service was top notch, especially our butler Eric. Would come back here again.",Food:Location
"Luxury resort chains are not usually where I stay when travelling, but the Shangri-La Boracay Resort and Spa definitely provided a memorable taste of the upmarket all-inclusive pampering beach resort experience. From the minute I landed at the Caticlan jetty and was ushered into a private speedboat to transport me and other passengers to the hotel, I felt very well looked after. I stayed in a Deluxe Seaview room overlooking Punta Bunga Beach. The room was clean, well lit, spacious and furnished in a lovely eco-modern style, with a wonderful ocean view. The resort itself is well designed, with an array of modern SE Asian-style room, bungalow and villa accommodations arranged around the central complex of lobby, restaurants, swimming pools and boutique shops and salons. For the most part, the resort staff were friendly, courteous and very prompt in responding to my requests. In fact there is enough going on at the resort to accommodate the needs of most every kind of tourist, especially couples and families; for me, highlights of the resort included sumptuous breakfasts at the Vintana Cafe, a fantastic seafood dinner at the cliffside restaurant Sirena and especially spa treatments at the temple-like Chi Spa, whose team of masseuses are really top-notch - very warm and professional. The rooms at the Chi Spa itself are also beautiful and serene, and there is a small wading pool nearby if one wants to relax further afterwards. Would definitely recommend this resort for those wanting to relax and refresh in style.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Stayed here for our wedding in January 2015. From the second we stepped onto the resort, we were very well looked after! Staff very helpful and willing to go out of their way to help. I'm not sure if they all carried pictures of all their clients, but every single staff we walked pass would greet us personally with our names with a good morning/afternoon/evening! Rooms are very clean and looked after! We made use of the gym and their facilities was great! Their gym was staffed who was able to help with anything we required.
Food at breakfast/dinner was amazing! Everything cooked to perfection!
If you stay here I HIGHLY recommend the Chi Spa. I wanted to melt after our full body massage! I've never felt so relaxed! It was heaven!
Finally, our wedding. Could not have picked a better place to have our special day! They took care of everything! Our villa that we stayed in have the most amazing views!

"I've never encountered a hotel where fondness for ROOM NUMBER INQUIRY from guests except from this hotel. Sometimes the ROOM NUMBER QUESTION even comes first before the customary pleasantries which anybody would agree as rude. Its like you are there but you have to make the staff believe everytime you encounter or need something from them. Our family had to wait for almost an hour for their shuttle to arrive. Front desk staff doesn't know the billing process which is why you have to check your bill thoroughly. In fairness, the hotel is above average but I wouldn't say worth the premium price they are asking from their guests. It's better to stay in Shangrila Mactan",Staff:Value for money

"I thought I'd written a review of this hotel years ago, but I guess not. How I failed to shared my experience is a mystery. Our trip was not taken in Nov 2014, but in Sep 2013.
My trip to Boracay was essentially my honeymoon; the wedding having taken place nearly a year earlier. From the beginning to the end, the extent the hotel went to ensure anything my wife and I wanted/needed were fulfilled is unmatched. We stayed in one of the private villas, which are absolutely amazing; private pool and backyard/patio, beautiful bedroom and bathroom facilities. The hotel gave us a cell phone we were to use anytime we needed to call on our own attendant. Sonny was our ""butler"" and we couldn't have asked for a more attentive, courteous, and respectful member of their staff.
The grounds of the hotel are well secure and have private beaches and boat launches. While most everyone else who comes to Boracay has the inconvenience of riding the public ferry to/from the island, Shangri-La has a private precheck-in lounge and a private boat to take you to the resort. While the resort is not within walking distance to the main nightlife district, they do provide a free shuttle. Their staff can arrange for any of the myriad of activities Boracay has to offer; parasailing, helmet diving, jet skis, etc. While we were there, the wife took in a day at the resort's spa while I spent the time snorkeling off one of the private beaches taking underwater video. If we got bored of the beach or the pool, we took advantage of the game room in the main building of the resort. The beachside bar was a very nice place to sit on the beach and watch the sunset while you wish your trip would never end. The only unpleasant experience we had was at one of the resort's restaurants, Rima, where not only were the staff rude to my Filipina wife, their service was terrible. We passed on our displeasure to Sonny. The next day one of the manager's apologized for our experience and offered compensation, which we politely turned down.
It was a sad day to have to leave Shangri-La...but we've vowed to return for a longer stay the next time. Thanks Sonny!!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
The resort is insane. The service is unbelievably good. Since the time you land in the airport till the time they check you in it is all amazing. We were unlucky with the weather but the resort has enough facilities to make up. The food is top notch. They have amazing activities for kids. Overall a must stay place and a definite visit again for us.,Staff:Food

"Chiming in a little late here, I'll admit. Stayed here for a day late August 2015. Booked a family suite, but they offered a relatively low priced upgrade to a tree house villa, so I decided to go for it.

Amazing, to say the least! Impeccable service and helpful staff all around. Loved the pool and the private beach; definitely one of the best I've seen in and around Philippines as well as most of SEA.

Definitely staying here again when I come back to Boracay; this time, for more than just a day.",Staff
The quality of my family's experience was extremely high. Wife and 2 young boys sad to leave. On last day baby boy was sick. Hotel manager Keith Rajan accompanied us throughout and arranged pick up for hospital when we landed in Manila. All feedback we gave was graciously received and acted on. Shangrila's Global Head of Food and Beverages was there and took time to improve our stay. Every single staff member made an effort and was charming. We are very grateful.,Staff:Food
"Lets get to the important part first. Would we stay here again.....definitely not! The hotel is not horrible and the staff are generally friendly, but I'm afraid they neglected a very important feature of the stay....'the hotel room'. My review is based on the high price we paid to stay here.

We stayed in a very expensive villa that was musky, dusty and dirty. The villas are also extremely dark. Many things within the room were broken and the musky smell was a big issue. There are no fans within the villa or on the patio so there was no air movement. Wherever we walked outside our feet were black and grainy due to the poor maintenance of the outside areas. Cobwebs and dead plants were a common sight. Our Butler was bossy and didn't make us feel at home. We tried to avoid her as much as possible. Although you are staying in the Philippines, the prices within the hotel are comparable to that of the Maldives.

The hotel really needs to do a few urgent things to the villas:

Install fans in to the lounge, bedrooms and outdoor patio to help with the musky smell
Get rid of the old musky smelling furniture
Scrub the villas from top to bottom
Give all the cushions a good wash
Power hose the outdoor areas and get rid of all the cobwebs.
Invest in a decent gardener
Create some extra light in the living area
Touch up some paint work and replace the old rotting roof weed hanging in front of the windows
Fix all the broken fixtures and fittings

I can't understand why you would provide accommodation that people would not want return to. With the huge amount of staff around, you have the resources.

I don't want to drive away business, but the hotel needs a good kick up the behind.

Our stay was not unbearable but not good enough for us to recommend to others or ever return again.",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness:Staff
"I stayed at the Shangrila for 10 days as part of my honeymoon. We visited Hong Kong, Manila and Boracay and this was the pinnacle of the holiday. We had a standard room with a garden view and although this is the entry level room it was amazing. We were also made to feel so welcome and valued by the staff.

Before arriving we had to make some changes to our pick up and drop off and the staff were excellent, so we had a great impression already.

Breakfast was very good - difficult not to over indulge!

The pool and beaches were great, so relaxing and the service at both was really good! The staff always found a sunbed or chair at buys times and then once we had a base the waiter service was excellent, friendly and attentive!

We also took some classes and went to the gym. The morning exercise classes and yoga were excellent and the gym was really good. We also went out on the Kayaks which was really good fun and a nice way to explore.

In the evening we ate at the beach/pool bar which was very nice and (when eating the Asian dishes) was good value. the charge for the western food at the bar was a little excessive - if I recall correctly chips were about £8 for a small bowl and Strawberries even more, in comparison to chicken noodles for about £5.... still not a big deal!

The main restaurant in the evening was a slight negative as the buffet was fairly over priced especially as the food wasn't top quality. That said we ordered from the A La Carte menu and on the two occasion we ate there, had a really nice meal. Service was really good.

One other area for improvement would be the shuttle buses. It's a tough ask to keep everyone happy on this one as demand varies so much, so it's not so much the frequency of buses more the queuing system that needs attention at busy times. One evening it came under pressure when a large group of Germans arrive and strolled to the front as two buses pulled up.... fortunately a myself and a Russian guy in the queue manage to highly how everyone had been waiting but the driver still had to get a member of staff to sort the large group out! My suggestion would be to simply have a rope and post queuing system to make it clear that people are waiting and prevent people pushing in! All that said, this wasn't a massive problem as when staff arrived the correct order was restored and everyone who had been waiting was happy.

We also had a several great evenings at the pool bar, as there was often a band and happy hour at sunset which was great fun. Again the bar staff were great and the cocktails were really good.

We genuinely loved our stay at Shangri La Boracay, it was so relaxing and so much fun, I'd recommend this resort with out hesitation. The location and facilities are excellent and the staff are absolutely top level. I'm looking forward to my next stay at a Shangri La!",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed for 4 nights and after a long flight from London, arriving to paradise was well worth it! From the moment you disembark the speed boat, the service received was one of the best i have seen in a long time. Nothing was ever too much trouble. Rooms were enormous, with a great view, the private beach and pool have views to die for! Breakfast spread was pretty immense! The one downside was the restaurants are almost double the price of the main town.
Going to Boracay was well worth it, and staying at the Shangri-La made it all that better.",Food:Location:Value for money
"We stayed at the resort for a week at the end of a month long stay in Asia. It was pure bliss form start to finish.

The low density nature of the resort meant that at no point did you feel like you were anywhere but on a private resort where the main focus was your enjoyment and relaxation. We felt spoilt by staff who were attentive without being overbearing.

Fantastic service through the airports and transfer by boat. Pricing was reasonable throughout the resort and breakfast was out of this world!

Great quality throughout the resort, lovely beaches and pools and everything we needed for a relaxing stay.

Perfect relaxation spot.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We had a great vacation at this hotel, this has been by far our best experience at a Shangri-La. Since we arrived in Caticlan we started experiencing the first class customer service, we were taken to a private lounge to wait for the speedo boat to take us to the resort. Every single staff member provided a state of the art customer service, you can really fell that the standard is the same throughout the hotel. Check in was fast and easy, the room was clean and very spacious, overall the facilities are pristine and very well decorated. The hotel offers a shuttle service to the town and back to the hotel which is a great perk. Food quality is very good, although the menus are a bit limited.
We had only a couple of minor details at the Vintana restaurant, one our food took a lot of time to arrive and the other one I ordered a glass of wine which after 25 mins didn't arrive, I cancelled it and requested the check and the waitress that was serving us arrived with a bottle of wine as a courtesy for the inconvenience, every restaurant can make a mistake but how you handle it defines the service quality you are willing to provide and in this case it was excellent. When we departed it was really early in the morning and they even provided a packed breakfast for each one of us!
The only thing I think it should change (because it's important to me) is the coffee during breakfast, it is one of the worst coffees I have ever tasted!
I highly recommend this hotel if you are planning on traveling to Boracay! It's the best option!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Lets cut to the chase, The Shangri-La Boracay is superb. Arrival at the resort is by private speedboat. The resort itself is a beautiful Balinese inspired affair, with numerous sculptures and water features present throughout the marble floored, thatched roofed structures. The layout of the hotel is very good and easy to navigate around its many areas/floors. We stayed in a Premier Sea View room. Rooms are a good size and nicely presented inside. The bed was very comfy. Wi-fi was free and good signal throughout the resort. The hotel grounds and facilities were all great, the outdoor pool/beach/bar area was superb, fitness centre was good. The buffet breakfast was great with a huge selection of east and west cuisines. Dined at Alon (seafood restaurant) one evening, which was very nice and decent value for money. The hotel has a on-site dive/watersports centre who arranged a morning of parasailing & jetskiing, although i think we could have arranged the same a little cheaper had we gone direct to the activity provider. None the less, it was great fun. The hotel run regular free shuttle busses to D Mall (Station 2) so it is super easy and convenient to get down to the hussle and bustle of White Beach and all its bars, shops and restaurants. The star of the stay though, despite the resort's beauty and impressive and extensive facilities, were the Shangri-La staff. Always smiling, friendly, discreet when needed but happy to chat also, professional and personable, all of the staff are a credit to the hotel. Special mention to Mr. Rodney, the assistant manager, who addressed one issue we had regarding our arrival at the hotel (due to 2 cancelled flights and the knock on effect this had with non-hotel guests whom we ended up traveling with) in a sympathetic and professional manner, which was greatly appreciated by my partner and I. The Shangri-La is quite expensive, but it really is a first class resort destination and you get a lot of hotel for your money. Really didn't want to leave and wished that i had booked for longer. I will have very fond memories of the Shangri-La for many years to come, but i hope it is not that long until i get the chance to return again. Thank you Shangri-La Boracay for a fantastic stay and hope to be back again soon.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"This hotel exceeded our expectations from start to finish. Whilst the rooms are a little dated the service is second to none! Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.

The breakfast buffet was incredible! There is so much to choose from, and the staff would bring food to you so you didn't have to stand around waiting for eggs etc to be cooked. I would suggest getting there before 9.30 am as it gets very busy after and you do end up waiting for a table. Breakfast does go on until 11am for those who appreciate a late wake up on holiday.

They have shuttles that go into town every hour and then every half an hour in the evening which is fantastic as the resort is not walking distance from stations 1/2/3.

The bar at the seafood resort is a great place to kick back in the evenings with a drink and soak in the views...again the staff are super friendly and very attentive.

There's a games room with pool and table tennis for those short bursts of rain.

The hotel staff greeted us at Kalibo airport despite us using an Independent transfer company and made sure everything was looked after right until we checked in at kalibo for our departing flight.

Absolutely outstanding service!! In particular, thanks to Dave and Keith who were fantastic.

"The breakfast was excellent, other than that below is the following issues we had with Shangri-La Boracay -

- Our luggage only came after 45 mins we check in to the room. When the luggage arrived one piece was missing. It took another 15 mins for it to be delivered.
- There was supposed to be complimentary fruits to be delivered to the room but it never came.
- We had baby cot in the room but when we changed room the baby cot was not moved to the new room.
- The jacuzzi in the broke down twice and it wasted an hour for the technicians to fix it
- We were dining at Sirena and we waited an hour there was no food serve. In the end, the waitress misplaced our order and guest that came later was served first.

The staff are very forgetful and guest have to keeping remind them of their request which is stressful for holiday goers like us. Not advise to stay here unless you like to repeat yourself to the staff.",Staff:Food
"We've heard great things about Shangri-La Boracay before, and it has always been our dream to stay there.

From the time we arrived in Caticlan until our departure, we were taken care of. I appreciate the convenience of their exclusive lounges because I hate being made to wait. On the day of our flight back to Manila, it was raining pretty hard, but not a drop of rain fell on my head because the very solicitous staff was always ready with an umbrella even before you could start looking for one. Most hotels' service stops at the airport drop off, but Shang has their own staff inside the airport who assisted us with the check-in, to the payment of the terminal fee, and accompanied us until we're comfortably seated inside their own lounge at the pre-departure area. I never had to lift my (very small) bag the entire time.

Our room was great, although the walls in the bedroom and some of the tile grouts in the bathroom could be whiter. The toilet bidet has this insanely strong water pressure. I have a high pressure hose at home for cleaning my car and it's nothing compared to this bidet. :) Im sure the staff would have done something about it, had we brought it to their attentions, but honestly, my sisters and I were too busy gushing and marvelling at the place that we never got around to calling the staff about the bidet.

I was able to use the gym, and the gym facilities are awesome, and clean. We wanted to use the jacuzzi (they have a sauna and steam room as well), but were told that the pump for the jacuzzi wasn't working. The breakfast buffet is probably its best feature. We mostly hang out at the pool area, and when it got hot, the staff would pass around this tasty fruit sampler. During our stay at the beach, we saw dark clouds from a distance and a staff approached us to warn us that there is an impending rain (you know, just in case we misinterpret dark clouds for something else), and we should probably secure our things before they get wet. The two beaches in Shangri-La are kinda smallish, and doesn't have the fine white sand of Station 1, but we prefer Shang because of the peace and quiet of its beaches, its ever watchful lifeguards, and really, who doesn't like having your needs taken care of. The service was second to none.

When we got a bit bored, we played games at their entertainment zone. It's got everything we need for a three day vacation and we immensely enjoyed our stay that we didn't feel the need to take that hourly shuttle to D'Mall. It's got strong wifi, fast internet, and you get connected immediately without inconveniencing you the need to input passwords (and room numbers and other info that other hotels ask). As long as you're within its premises, even in the beach area, you're connected.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Being my first time at Shangri La Boracay, my expectations were high. And I was not disappointed. The property itself is a sprawling Eden of well manicured gardens, pools and paths that are a credit to the operators. Our ocean view room was larger, accommodating and clean although the TV picture was not so great and you could tell the furniture and fixtures were almost last there use by date - but acceptable. I was looking forward to dining at Rima and was not disappointed. Excellent quality, discreet service and great presentation of food; I just was hoping for more engagement from the staff about the food and concept.
Sirena on the other had is worth missing. My steak was under seasoned, tasteless and poorly presented. The staff tried hard but were just lost. We must have had 3 people serve us and the restaurant was not even half full and they were running around like maniacs.
The Chi Spa - excellent! Worth every penny.
Pool is fabulous but they definitely need more staff in that area to serve guests. I would have loved to have ordered more food and drinks but I could never find a waiter and when I did,; they weren't a waiter and they say they would go find one only to never return.

"1) Location (4/5) - Reachable by round-trip journey transfer arrangement directly from Caticlan Jetty Port to the resort. But , we only experienced shuttle pick up from another hotel to reach Shangri-La. Shuttle service to White Beach is inconvenience which the guest have to queue and wait for a certain period.

2) Staff Performance (3/5) - Check-in and Check-out are quick and smooth. Staffs are helpful and friendly with greets and smile. Please allocate more staff in the resort compound to assist the guest as few of the guests seeking my assistance for the direction to few areas in the resort , which I am actually a guest and I am not pretty sure the direction as well. Buggy service and Pool service is good.

3) Hotel Condition / Cleanliness (4/5) - Overall is good and the resort is huge with the rooms and villas are located at very strategic place. Pool and beaches are clean. However, the compound is a bit tired which definitely need some touch-up and refurbish. Found cigarette ash near pool area and restaurant area. Love to read under the excellent ambience and environment with the excellent design of the resort. Signage and direction are quite confusing as they should assigned more staff to guide since it is a 5-star resort. Wifi in the resort is stable and good.

4) Room Condition / Cleanliness (3/5) - Check-in the Deluxe Seaview with obstructed view. Some unripe banana and mango were prepared together with the fruit knife provided. Entered the room and found the bedsheet stained and some dead bugs or insects inside the room,near the bed, on the balcony and also the daybed. Bathroom is clean and the toiletries are almost complete expect the bubble bath foam. A funny 2014's Calendar was displayed in the room. Iron board and iron provided are the bonus.

5) Facilities / Activities (4/5) - Experienced the Entertainment Centre and Health Club. Gym was fully equipped while we managed to attend a Zumba Class even the Sauna was not in service during our stay. Staff from CHI Spa is not so friendly.

6) Food / Dining (3/5) - We only visited the Vintana Cafe for the buffet breakfast with variety options but the most highlighted is I found a curly hair in the anchovy, and the dining table were full with ants.However, the Solana Bar with excellent drinks and snack are the best accompany to catch the most beautiful sunset.

"We spent 5 nights at Shang Boracay for our honeymoon as recommended by friends who had been a few times and loved it. We knew it was 5 star and well we did expect a 5 star quality stay.

Let me start by saying that it is the staff that truly make this resort. They are brilliant. I want to especially mention Sonny and Michael the butlers, Salvadore the pool attendant and Jun one of the concierge.

I firstly recommend you have the Shang meet you at the airport and take you to the resort. If this is not included just pay for it, trust me it will alleviate time and hassle you do not need at the start of the holiday. You are met by the Shang, whisked away in their van to private ferry lounge where you are given drinks, cold towels etc. Then you are loaded into private boat and off you go to arrive at private jetty and buggy to reception, so hassle free, no taking of your own bags all super easy!

We stayed in a treetop villa which was one of 4 right at the top of the hill which I gather are mainly for 'honeymooners'. I certainly cannot fault the view and the ridiculous size of the place! However be aware you are very far up, so it's easy to walk down the hill to breakfast, beach etc about 7 mins, but you kinda need to be buggied back up as its steep, far and hot! A great bonus with the villa is a butler who you can contact 24 hours a day with the mobile phone you are given. I'll talk more about this later.

I kinda believe the small thoughtful things count - so I loved the fresh fruit and biscuits each day, the fact the room is cleaned at your chosen time, room turn down and blinds closed when the afternoon sun comes through and bookmarks with messages on your pillow. I was a little disappointed that the Shang no longer uses L'Occitane products (except soap bars), choosing to become very hotel mainstream and refillable shampoos, conditioner etc. (And not the nicest quality either).

However, although I understand the resort is only 6 years old, the villa was certainly getting 'tired'. It could definitely use a good renovation and update of decor. The electric curtains did not work on the main curtain and a couple other small things like fence posts needing repair.

Now we did have a false start on the first day we arrived. After we arrived we decided to go into the town to look around and get some lunch. We asked the butler to have a buggy collect us in time for the hourly shuttle. Buggy didn't show, shuttle went. We decided to wander down to the lobby and look around the pool and wait for next shuttle. However, as soon as the concierge saw us they profusely apologised that the buggy had run out of battery and quickly put us in a private shuttle to the town. Oh and another great thing about the shuttle is there is a concierge to meet you on the return leg and arrange your return, very organised in the chaos believe me!

So this was fine, but later in the day we returned from the pool to find we couldn't get into our villa and people inside.Turned out reception thought the room empty and were showing it to some travel agents. Well you can imagine I was NOT HAPPY, made that very clear. It got sorted out and the Manager was quick to turn up and apologise and comped us an evening meal (an expensive meal!)

It was well worth having a nicer room that comes with the butler. Michael and Sonny organised and suggested anything we needed. They arranged the Spa, Island hop snorkelling and private dinner. All were amazing. And actually I would recommend the private chef dinner that was a highlight. Food was amazing 5 course dinner. As the effects of the typhoon hit Boracay we could not have on the beach as hoped but it was still arranged in one of the beach villas and was still absolutely lovely on our last evening.

I want to mention that the pool service is the best at any hotel I have stayed. For a start there are 4 pools, it's huge! The attendants find you a seat, bring towels and water. We didn't order food but we did visit the bar for happy hour cocktails. We didn't know when happy hour was and we turned up about 20 mins early the first time. But the staff were so lovely they didn't put the charges through until after 5 when the computer changed to happy hour. Now, if you are on your honeymoon and hoping not to see children, this isn't the place for you. Kids are everywhere and the pool is their stomping ground! There is an adults only pool but quite frankly this is ignored and the staff are too polite to enforce this rule really.

The service continues at the beach, with attendants bringing towels and water and setting you up. And they have free snorkelling gear if you want and it is in very good condition. And of course there are lifeguards at the beach and pool.

Breakfast is one of the best buffets out there. The sheer variety of food is incredible including options for gluten free, paleo and vegetarians. And although the resort was apparently 95% full we never had trouble getting a table no matter the time we arrived. I would not recommend the restaurant for the dinner buffet. It was very bland and boring and not at all worth the money.

When we left due to the typhoon we had to travel by shuttle to the boat on the other side of the island, then take the boat to dock at another place and then another shuttle to the airport. So be warned when the weather is bad you will need to do this. It was very organised. At the airport we were met by the Shang airport concierge who told us our flight had been cancelled but he had arranged us to be on the earlier flight. He took our bags and passports, checked us in, took us to the departure fee and wah lah all sorted minimal fuss. Brilliant! This is was so much appreciated and ended our Shang experience on such a high note. As I said at the beginning, the staff really do make the resort. I hope the Shang recognises this and looks after them!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Any discerning traveler who appreciates pure luxury surroundings, fine food and service must stay at the tree house at the Shangri-la Boracay! Yes, the tree house is quite expensive, but worth every single cent!

Right from the airport pick up to the speed boat and to the pick up buggy to the tree house, meeting our butler to check in at our hotel and buggy transporting us around the resort....everything was flawless! Even from checking out back to the airport, through going through security, to its own lounge at the airport, you were taken care of until you boarded the plane back home. Congratulations Shangril-la Boracay, you have done well with this experience.

The food top notch and I was quite impressed with the fine dining restaurant called Rima, the food spectacular and delicious with matching service to rival any chefs hat or Michelin rated restaurant. Thank you for my cake to celebrate my birthday on this evening. The buffet breakfast- incredible, come with an empty stomach and be satisfied for the rest of the day, the variety is endless!

You do not need to leave the resort, but if you do a free shuttle to D' mall at station 2 is provided. As soon as we left the resort, we wanted to go back to avoid the craziness and crowds of white beach.

I have never seen such blue waters with coral and fish so close to the 2 private beaches that you can choose from. You could also use the sailing boat, go snorkeling or go kayaking which was all complementarity if you stayed at the tree house. Or if you wanted you could choose the pool and have a bite and enjoy the cocktails.

All staff go above and beyond- they are well trained, you are treated like royalty and they remember you each time. Special mention goes to our butler- Sonny. Please congratulate him on the amazing experience- above and beyond and the attention and care he provided us during this memorable trip. I am sure you are looking after him, if not, you need to. I hope he will still be around next year when we come back for my mothers 60th birthday.",Staff:Food
"I stayed here as a romantic beach weekend getaway and was happy with my choice.

We booked a seaview suite but was nicely upgraded to the treetop villa which has some serious design flaws. The two level villa is spacious but for some reason, the stairs connecting the 2 floors is located OUTSIDE the room. You have to leave the rooms to move between levels. It's very odd that I have to go outside to go up and down. There is a nice jacuzzi facing the sea which gives it amazing view and I used the balcony to tan. Thankfully we didnt have anyone in the adjacent villas as there is absolutely no privacy on the outdoor terrace. There isn't a separation between the villa so you could see what's going on next door in the outdoor terrace with the jacuzzi. The design of the room is so mind boggling.

The toiletries aren't L'Occitane branded as most of the other Shangrilas and I was mildly disappointed. No charging points near the bed.

However, the view from the room made up for the above as it was just spectacular. The white sand, clear blue waters. Heavenly!

Service was a mixed bag. We had our own private butler which made it easier for us to coordinate requests/arrangements etc. Michael was lovely. Every staff that we came into contact with was obliging and friendly. We left a shopping bag at the airport lounge but the hotel manage to get their staff to retrieve it for us. However, it took us 35 minutes to get checked in on what appeared to be a quiet day and our bags then took another 40 minutes to be delivered.

A big turn off was when the hotel reservation team, prior to our arrival, sent back and forth emails to get us to guarantee our airport transfer by credit card since we had paid for the room through a third party website. I was quite annoyed as we were forking out close to $1,000 a night and they were hassling us for credit card over email, which was a separate security concern as well. I've arranged for plenty of airport transfer but have never had to separately guarantee one before I've arrived.

We never left the resort during our 3D2N stay and we ate at the resort. Breakfast was a delight with such a wide array of food. Food at Rima and Sirena was delectable. The hotel's private beaches was very very nice. Clean and soft white sand and clear blue waters.

Would consider returning. Recommended.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"My husband and I were very satisfied with this resort. I would definitely recommend this resort to anyone.

"Lovely resort and must go if youre in Boracay, but over time staff are tired and not hospitable as in the past. I was here at resort beginning and service level has significantly changed. If this is getting worse when i come back in the future, will have to think again about staying.",Staff:Location
"Spent by birthday weekend here and I was truly pampered from the moment I stepped onto the Resort. We booked the Treetop Villa and it was worth every penny. From the awesome view to the luxury bedding and amenities offered in the room. Not forgetting the exemplary service by our Butler, Sonny who looked after our every need, especially the little surprise 'touches' that Sonny took to have a birthday cake together with balloons to decorate the room and set rose petals all over the bath tub for that romantic ambience. I was lucky to enjoy a very nice fireworks from my very own Villa with direct view! I loved the infinity pool with the private jacuzzi looking over the clear blue waters of the ocean. The private beach with comfortable sun-bed and attentive staff is a plus point. I am already looking to book another trip back next year.
Tip: Treetop Villa #21 has the best view of the whole resort.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"When we arrived at the hotel pier, we were welcomed by hotel staff that said ""Welcome to Paradise"", i laughed when i heard this but when we left, i think she was right. It truly is paradise. The reason for this review is to give a special thank you to 4 staff members that made our stay so special. Mr. Salvador - he worked on the private beach mainly but he was never standing still, always helping guests and working tirelessly to make sure everyone is comfortable. He cant speak but that didn't prevent him from communicating with the guest by providing exceptional service. Next is Mr. Ferry - he remembered us from the first day and he seemed to be at every hotel restaurant we ate at. He made sure my kids and wife were always well looked after, chocolate milk and fresh orange juice every breakfast. Such a nice and welcoming person. If we needed anything he would make sure we had it. Mr. Rome and Mr. Laudito - they worked mainly around pool and again, remembered us from our first arrival and welcomed us every day by name.
Everyone staff member we met was extremely pleasant and helpful but my wife and i wanted to give special recognition to these 4 persons. It was an amazing holiday.",Staff:Food

"This was our second time to stay here in Shangrila Boracay. We love it so we will keep coming back. Our first stay was much better as there were some problems this trip, plumbing, power, wifi, restaurants etc. But the staff handled everything graciously, speedily and attentively. My son got sick this trip and they took excellent care of him! They even sent a complimentary get well kit to our room! The amenities and resort are world class! The food is very good! Since its low season now though (July) they closed some restaurants which disappointed us. In particular our favorite, Cielo. The service is impeccable and the food and drink excellent! You will not regret staying here. Sirena restaurant is overrated and overpriced in terms of food but the view, service and ambiance is incredible. I feel like the resort is my home awAy from home. So peaceful, serene, tranquil... I wish I could live there! Of all the hotels and resorts I've stayed in, Shangrila (any of them), is by far the best I've gone to. They go above and beyond! Boracay in particular is excellent and the spa was amazing.",Food:Staff:Location
"Very private beach resort away from Bora's crowd! Private Speed boat is awesome. Less hassle, from Airport to Resort you just need to sit back and relax till you reach the hotel. We travelled as family with 2 kids and not much work for us as private van to jetty port is available as well so no worries might you ride crowded transpo. Babysitting is available too for free.

White fine sand is awesome! Beach is very clean and safe, very private, the semi private one is looks like private too, very quite place and it is so lovely to relax with. Pool are clean, very nice jacuzzi kids loves the bubbles too! Food are superb though very expensive but i think its worth it to be honest! Very nice view while dining in anywhere of their restaurants.

Loads of activities to do from, everyday there is activities ready for kids and adults and thats the best part too and all are free like kayaking, snorkelling. Kids activities like kite making, bracelet making, guitar designing etc will kids surely enjoy.

Huge resort but there is a buggy you can use to go anywhere you wanted but we usually walk as it nice to enjoy the view too.

Over all experience is great! Will definitely going back to this Paradise!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food

"This must be the best hotel at Boracay. Fresh style, perfect location, big rooms and very friendly and service minded staff. The only drawback is the price. If you compare Shang ri la prices in Makati, the price for average food is 10 times higher.

"I am very familiar with the Shangri-La brand ,having stayed numerous times in Mactan, Cebu and Makati, Manila. I have been Boracay before 5 times but this is first time Shangri-La.
They did not disappoint.
You get the feeling something is very special right from the airport when Shangri la representative greets you , grabs luggage, and puts you in aircon van to the special Shangri la lounge where you are greeted in beautiful surroundings with cool washcloth and cool drink. From here you are taken to Shangri La's private boat (a beauty)...no stopping to pay terminal fee, tipping porters, and waiting on line with others for the public boat from Caticlan to Boracay....No changing to separate vehicle with luggage when landing on Boracay...no sir...this is private boat taking you from Caticlan directly to the Shangri la dock...where a welcoming traditional drum beating band greeted us. Stayed in the fabulous treehouse villa where chck in was done and luggage arrived promptly.
There aren't words to describe Treehouse Villa...it is 2 level...bottom level being the master bedroom with the bed facing wall of glass and a million dollar view of the Ocean.
Curtains are controlled by remote. Also on bottom level was a comfortable living area...huge bathroom with big stall shower and separate tub with that million dollar view out the window...again privacy controlled by remote. Going upstairs to 2nd level is humungous living area with tv, tables, bathroom, small efficiency kitchen with microwave, refrigerator, and coffee maker. Sliding doors brings you outside to a huge balcony with 2 lounge chairs and a huge jacuzzi...and that million dollar view.
But wait...theres more.
You also have a butler assigned to you for any advice or about anything that needs attending to. You are given a separate cell phone with direct contact to him.
Our butler Vicente was outstanding in every way...when we wanted to have breakfast in..we just gave the order to Vicente and he proceeded it and had it delivered...needed any dinner ideas or reservations? Vicente took care of it. Being up high on the hill it was a decent walk down to the beach/pool or restaurant area...when Vicente knew we were going down he would have a golf cart buggy waiting at our room. But he outdid himself when he overheard me talking about how much i like kinilaw...(filipino version of ceviche)..before i knew it he had arranged with the chef to specially prepare it for next days lunch which he had setup in a private cabana poolside.
He added so much to an already great experience, and his professionalism should be recognized. Thank you again Vicente. I would also be remiss not to mention the entire staff as first rate...the surroundings are breathtaking, but without competent, smiling staff it means nothing.
Time we were there was bit windy which made ocean a little rough...but there is a generous sized infinity pool waiting for you...the beach is private and very inviting and sundown happy hour at the tiki hut beachside is a great way to wind down before dinner with traditional dancers and live music to celebrate the end of another day in paradise.
Everything here guarantees you a 5 star experience..but you know what they say...You get what you pay for. Luxury doesn't come cheap..which is fine except i wish more of that money was filtering down to the staff...they can make or break a resort,,, I hope management is listening.
Being very familiar with Boracays White Beach, we went several times there to dine and enjoy music and experience the usual excitement. Shangri la offers van shuttles to Dmall..or you can take tricycle back if you don't want wait for the van.
All in all an outstanding experience...
If there was any..ANY..downside here it was accessibility to White beach where all the nightlife is. Well done Shangri la.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"We stayed two nights at the Shangri-La whilst attending a wedding that was held at the resort. The room we had was lovely, but we thought that by paying extra for a sea view, would be more than just a snippet of blue between the trees. The resort itself is luxurious and the staff were very friendly, efficient and nothing was too much trouble. The main area and breakfast dining room was quite a long walk from our room, but the breakfast was well worth it once you got there. The resort provided a shuttle to a tuk tuk pick up area where you could pay the drivers to take you to other beaches or the local shopping centre. The boat ride to and from the Island was really enjoyable, and to be met and farewelled by a local musical group was lovely.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
Our second time at Shangrila and now with our kids. Very child friendly environment and the staffs are very courteous. You will never stay at other hotels after staying at Shangrila. They cannot simply match the value of your money with the service and environment you can enjoy. Definitely will be your new standard of hotel staycation.,Staff
"Had the time of my life here and would come back anytime! Great facilities with very nice staff who are absolutely polite but easy going and genuine! The breakfast buffet is another dream, and gets you full until dinner when you can take a shuttle to the island´s downtown where you find all kinds of restaurants and bars. A bit pricier than other places but you get even more than what you pay for, so no regrets at all! Thank you Shangri-la, until next time!",Food:Location:Staff
"We choose Shangri La based all their excellent review. we arrived around 2pm unfortunately our butler informed us that our 2 bedroom villa is not ready yet and we have to wait for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Not good first impression isn't it. Finally we got our villa at 4pm. The villa is beautiful, Shangri La is known as best amenities.
stayed for 3 days with most of the times raining is not stop us to enjoy pool ( I love the pool its beautiful).
My favorite bar is Solana bar with my favorite cocktail Rendezvous ( similiar like Lychee martini) with a nice view and friendly staff.
For breakfast they have huge selection of food and again friendly and helpful staff, hopefully they can consistence with their service because another day they never serve water and another day they serve water or another day the serve coffee with milk and another day we have to ask 2 times.
Sirena bar is one of our favorite restaurant in Shangri La, Christine and Charm really looked after us, the service is attentive enough.
To be honest my big impression about Shangri La is the staffs, they are so friendly, helpfull. A lot of property has good room,facilities and pool but staff the one who make it big different.
Highly recommend. Will coming back on Summer.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"This undoubtedly the best resort on the island of Boracay. There is almost none other international hotels/resorts on the island therefore if you are looking for someone really knowing how to please seasoned and discerning travellers, I believed you have to look no more, Shangri-La's Boracay is the place.

Having said that, there are things that they should improve on. I came during a wet season and due to the fiery wave, the exclusive Shangri-La's boat docking station was closed for good reason - safety. Because of that, when we arrive, we were transferred to the Shangri-La's lounge, after which, we were transferred by coach to another pier, then we took the speedboat, then another land transfer. One of the reason why we chose Shangri-La is because we want hassle free, but we were not 'warned' this could be the alternative route how you would reach the resort. Because of safety, we are very obliging and understanding. But we were amazed throughout the journey, there is no offering of drinking water, not even welcome drink when we arrive at the Shangri-La's lounge at the pier. We went to Maldives numerous time, when you are in the speedboat, cold refreshing towel and chilled bottled water are the norm for 5 star luxurious resort. We were kind of disappointed as this is very common in the hospitality industry. We fed back to hotel but there is no reply throughout the duration of our stay nor they try to do anything with our feedback.

The kettle in the room was leaking, I told the housekeeping to take it away as it is hazardous if someone were to use it, and ask for a replacement but it never came. Call again in the evening and a replacement set came but asking for the malfunction kettle, which shows their coordination needs some improvement.

The hotel sits in a very large compound, and the landscape is very well maintained.

The swimming pool is nice with many different area for you to find your own favourite spot. They have 2 beaches, one is very private and the other not so but it was quite hence you always have the beach by yourself. Unfortunately throughout my stay, it has the Red flag indicator all the time, and I do not have the opportunity to swim in the sea which is a pity.

Generally, the staff are attentive and quite pleasant to deal with, which I would expect it from Shangri-La anyway.

I read a lot of reviews before making the reservation and it seems that everyone raved about the buffet breakfast. I am kind of disappointing for the spread and taste. The spread is good (don't get me wrong) but those reviews raised my standard so high and I would say this is quite normal for a 5 star resort in South East Asia, and if I were to compare to Shangri-La's Singapore, Shangri-La's Kuala Lumpur, Shangri-La's Bangkok and Shangri-La's Rasa Sayang Penang, it is kind of pale in comparison, both in terms of taste and spread. For example, the Garlic Fried Rice was tasteless and the stew belly pork was hard ... until the fat was so chewy and not those kind that melt in your mouth!

The cable channels are there to spoil you, thank goodness that even though the weather has not been good but we still have something to do - watch movies! I wish the TV can be a little bit bigger, but it is a 42"" with quite a long distance from the bedhead (this shows that the room is pretty sizable not just in terms of length but in terms of width as well.

Overall, it is a Shangri-La's so you can be assured that what you would expect from Shangri-La, it will be there to meet your needs, and certainly ours are almost met.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

3. Check-in: quick and easy and the manager is there to greet you right when you dock
4. Rooms: Plenty of choices and every single one pretty much has a view. Our room was always clean, always stocked
5. Activities: they have a center for water activities and also a family event area with video games, ping pong tables, large TV viewing area with a bar, pool tables and a separate area for kids
6. Restaurants: breakfast buffet is really good and you wont get tired of it if you go everyday of your stay with so many different world wide cuisines. Dont forget to try the home made ice cream! They also have many dining choices if you dont want to leave the facilities and the solana bar is the best happy hour all the way to night cap
7. Spa: tranquil, relaxing but somewhat expensive
8. Lobby: The view and the decor is amazing!
9. Gym: surprisingly well equipped and only place in the island with a rowing machine! Concept II!
10. The people: Everyone knows you by name. 'nough said.

If you're looking for a secluded resort in the island and want to feel like a ""baller"" without having to leave the premises and not get bored, this is the place for you.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"nice private beach and friendly stuff~ everything is good except that when we checked out, we got a bit confused on the bill, so i was discussing with my mom in our own language, but then the lady who helped us actually showed a bit impatience but with smile. she was like are u okay with everything? i have to assist the next guest. my trip was a bit messed up at that point . but anyways the overall experience is good. hope to come back again.",Staff
"This will have to be in bullet form because there's way too many points to cover/remember.

1) As everyone has said, the level of service by the staff is unprecedented. They've made a real point on training their staff to make each individual to feel like a VIP. This is no exaggeration. They are so helpful I might even say it's almost over the top sometimes. I won't waste anymore time on this point. But i'll state some examples as evidence below.
2) So just to explain to you the extent of the service - when you use the bathroom say near the pool or at the restaurants, you'll notice that the bathroom is always spotless and even the toilet paper is folded in a triangle. Then when you leave the bathroom you may notice a service employee walk in to 'rectify' the damage you've done so that it's all perfect for the next guest. So embarrassing.
3) Of notable mention was housekeeping and the services manager Ms Maralyn. My wife was sick with a common cough but couldn't sleep at night. We went to the medical clinic (yeah they have one with a full time doctor at the hotel...only costed about $40AUD for a consultation) and then came back to our room to find towels in the shapes of swans and elephants. Rose petals in a warm bubble bath. Love noted bookmarks and hand written notes. They brought special ginger tea with honey (on the house) and extra citrus fruits too. You don't even get that at your own home.
4) This may or may not be common at other hotels but it was a first for me - they have an evening turn down service meaning that house keeping come around in the early evening and turn your quilt down, re stock the place and clean again if required. Awesome.
5) Pro Tip - Do not attempt to get a taxi tricycle back to the resort from downtown. Shangrila provide a shuttle back and forth. Just stick with that. This comes from the experience of sliding down a long steep hill, in the wet, at night, with no lights, on a tricycle that skidded on its nose before coming to a stop metres from a rock wall. My wife had a few bruises, one on her head. Crazy experience. Had to walk to the resort in the rain at midnight. We're tough cookies and that wasn't fun, even for us.
6) Pro Tip - Wait for happy hour (5pm-7pm) for drinks by the hotel pool bar. Otherwise it's typical hotel prices for drinks.
7) Beaches don't have good waves if you're Aussie. FYI.
8) Mosquito loved us and didn't care for the locals. What the hell? Rascist.
9) Breakfast at the hotel is a must. Get it included in your rate...cause there's nothing else to eat close by. Oh and it's awesome. Huge selection, unlike the obnoxious american who I overheard say ""there's nothing good here"".
10) Spa is overpriced. Just go to town to get massages. 300 pesos on the beach for the old ladies for an hour. 500-600+ pesos for the better rated places with shower facilities, proper rooms, beds etc for an hour.
11) Free WIFI - EVERYWHERE! Like...in the beach. Like even in the water at the beach.

Happy to go into detail about anything else but this place is a must. Best place on the island. This island isn't really a huge party island like Bali or Phuket would be. So you're there to relax. Shangri-la is the place to do it. Unless you got a lot of money - don't worry about the villas. Just get the deluxe room and enjoy everything else the resort has to offer.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"I highly recommend people to stay in Shangri-La Boracay Resort , if you're looking for excellent service, tight security , beautiful scenery , great facilities and also, a good sleep. Throughout my stay in the Resort, I've received great help from all of the staff that I've approached for help. Front desk, In room dining, Housekeeping, Drivers and the guest service. I am a Vegetarian, so it is difficult for me to find food that is suitable for me in the Island.

"Our stay at the Shangri-la in Boracay was amazing and the best resort I've ever stayed at. I can see why you would pay the extra $$$ to stay at a resort like this - from the excellent service, the awesome amenities and just the general vibe of the place. We were staying in Boracay earlier in the week at a more budget friendly hotel, so it was a real treat to be able to stay at the Shangri-la and honestly don't know how we could go back to staying at places we normally stay.

The room itself is top notch - excellent furnishings, very clean, comfortable big bed and huge bathroom area. Wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the room a bit more! There is open wi-fi available all over the resort and it was excellent, even on the beachfront. The breakfast buffet was so good - so much variety and different options every day. The massive swimming pool was so beautiful and the beach area was stunning. The water was crystal clear unlike the water at White Beach (it might be the season?). The food was exceptional - we ate at the poolside restaurant a few times and the food served was of a very high standard - particularly the pasta (mushroom rigatoni - I still think about it).

The direct transfer from the resort to the airport is a breeze - no messing about with the road transfer to the jetty and then the boat - they take you directly to/from the Caticlan side. I just don't know how we will go back to travelling in our usual budget way to Boracay - Shangri-la has proven that the price you pay is totally worth every penny.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

Thumbs up to all the staff for letting us experience one of the most luxurious vacations we've ever had.

I love how they make each guest feel so welcome attending to all our needs. Restaurants had the best menus especially the Black Angus tenderloin steak at Rima! My son had it for two consecutive nights.

"staff were great and they made it a nice hotel to stay at. The room we were allocated had a great sea view. The staff were great and very helpful in everything they tried to do .... BUT there are a few things to remember that have an impact on your stay ... The hotel rate advertised is not what you pay there is another 25% on top . They charge you another 10% for service charge which you know goes to the hotel. Then there is 10% tax on top of every thing and then there are about another 5% envro tax.hence double charging .
The food selection for an Asian hotel was more like a fast foodies joint , seeing the hotel is in Asia and it's mainly Asians that visit the hotel the Asian selection was poor",Value for money:Food:Staff

"If you are the type of person who likes the beach but hates the crowd of Bora and you have money to burn, then Shangrila is the best place to be. I stayed only for 2 nights for a conference, and i would have love to stay longer if not for my other commitments. Let me start of my review with the place itself. I like the way they designed the entire resort.
You are surrounded by lots of trees and the hotel itself is covered by the lush greeneries. I would not be able to tell there are lots of people checked in except during breakfast or lunch when they go to take dinner in the cafe.

I had no issue with check-in and i got escorted up to my room which was quite far from the reception. Anyway their deluxe room is just right, similar to that of shang mactan where you have a king size bed with a sofa on the side. The bathroom was nicely done and very open. For the food, they do have a lot of selections for breakfast even for a vegan like me. The only complain i had is when i ordered ice from my room took them 30 minutes to get it to me.

For my short stay i got to enjoy the pool by myself as early as 630 am. and that was fantastic. Though the beach is not that long it was okay. but was not able to try to get into the water.

One must also try the Chi massage it is is really the ultimate spa experience i had. I got wrapped in hot banana leaves, that left me feeling so refreshed and so relax after.

On my way home, i was treated like a queen. I was escorted from the port up to the airport check in without me queing in the line. That is service deluxe. Ask me if i would go back. i would definitely go back here. This is the only reason i will come back to Bora.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

Service, amenities and food were fantastic and literally everyone greeted us with a smile and cheer.

"Just my personal experience and observation. The staff were friendly and tried to be attentive but they did mistakes and they didn't seem to communicate. Let me list down.

1. My roommate left one day before I did, at 5.30 am. She told hotel personnel I would check-out the day after. (And we also talked to them about the check-out time and the boat ride for both of us the night before) At 5.45 am. a hotel staff rang my doorbell which woke me up and asked ""What time is your flight?. I told him my flight was the next day and he answered ""Oh, ok, thank you."" (instead of sorry) Apparently they didn't communicate. You may imagine the frustration.

2. I asked for a morning call at 5.15 am. to catch the morning flight. The staff asked if it's for my colleagues' room which I emphasized 2 times it's for my room. Turned out the morning call went to their room. If I hadn't have set my own alarm, I would probably missed the flight.

3. The boat ride from and to airport is free of charge only during 7 am. - 6 pm. on ""per room"" basis. You have to pay 1000 peso if you need a ride before 7 am. which is a must if you have an early morning flight. The only way to access the hotel is by boat so I am a bit surprised they don't accommodate this.

4. There was a cockroach in my room.

5. The ground floor where the gym or ""health center"" is located has a strong smell. I guess it was a smell from the sewage and they tried to cover it with spray.

Other than this the hotel is very beautiful and chilled out.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed in a treetop villa for three days/ two nights last week. It was absolutely beautiful. Boracay has gotten very crowded since I last visited in 2001, and this resort is a welcome respite from all of the hustle and bustle.

This hotel is not cheap but well worth its tariff.",Food:Location:Value for money
"Stayed at the Shang in Boracay and the hotel did not disappoint. The location was paradise especially since it is secluded and away from the hustle and bustle of white beach. The hotel was quiet and so picturesque. They had enough lounges and umbrellas by the pool for everyone. We were given complimentary water, fruit juice and fruit skewers while at the pool.

I especially enjoyed the pool which was warm and slightly salty and surprisingly very mild to the eyes and skin. The breakfast buffet was good but dinner choices were limited probably since everyone else would go to white beach for dinner.

Our family room (442) was large and we had an exquisite view of the blue and sparkling sea. Our bathroom had a leak from the ceiling from the room upstairs on our last day. It wasn't such as big inconvenience so we just reported it to the front reception.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and can't wait to be back!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We attended a wedding and stayed for 2 nights. Overall, the staff were very helpful. When I requested for a glue after the strap of my heels snapped just before the ceremony, a staff rescued me with flip flops (same flip flops available in the guest rooms) and a woven bag to keep my shoes. The glue that I requested from the front desk took several follow-ups till a staff we met on the corridor was able to get from their maintenance guy. I appreciated the extra effort.

The buffet breakfast was great with lots of choices. We used the gym and we had it all to ourselves. The dinner we had by the pool was not as great though -the grilled pork was so-so.

My husband fell ill the day we checked-out (there were 2 other wedding entourage members who got sick during our stay). We spent 9 days in the hospital after that trip due to amoebiasis.

So, weighing the good and the bad from this trip, we have no plans of going back to Boracay again.",Staff:Food
"This one is different.
It is a review prior to staying there in July this year with My Wife on a 2nd Moneymoon with no kids in tow.
Just finished a fantastic trip with all to Palawan and decided when Buiss commitments fit in my Wife and self will have that 2nd Honeymoon this time (did not spell wrongly first time)
Decided to splurge based on a few factors I will mention and have booked the Shang in Boracay.
We have visited Boracay 5 times prior taking lots of overseas guests with us and mostly stayed at the Boracay Regency, always enjoyed the visits in that area.
This time I want to show my Wife some private affection away from the crowds unles we decide on a trip to town, though I will try like hell to as last time I ended up on a famous wheel barrow ride from a famous shooter bar that did not go down well with all when I tried to break the record.
I am forgiven now.
We have stayed a few times at the Shang in Mactan, Cebu and service out of this World.
Done the Shang in Makati also, it was OK for a City.
After reading reviews I am convinced this is probably the best resort Hotel in the Philippines at present.
A resort needs a beach and a private beach at best.
All the rest of Boracay can offer close, but not the personal service the Shang does.
Example, room service burger in Cebu served on a silver platter at 02:00 in morning after we left the Hotel night club and served by floor butler who payed out the table, WOW was I impressed and what a burger, Shang burgers renowned but so is the Italian food, best I ever had.
So I have got excited before I arrive and rightly so as this has been dream for a while whils the kids have been growing.
Yes they like a resort but to keep them (now teens) occupied whilst we want a total wind down is not easy.
Ben selfish I suppose, but they are big enough now to baby sit house and dogs whilst we have a wind down.
Both are learning to cook pot noodles at present and how to order Piza and Chow King in preparation for our departure, bless them, Hi............Hi...............
Your on yer own kids, will leave the wifi turned on for you.
Mammy and Daddy will send you some pics of us slumming it............
Enough for now and of course will follow up on report after stay.
We have a sea view Prem room booked for those who actually took out time to read this non review prior to staying.
See you soon Shang people.
Will mark all a 4 to send the review of a not so review.

"This is a nice resort and the staff is in general friendly. I am not giving it a 5-star review because my husband and I are a bit disappointed to find out that there is no internal staircase in the 2-levels tree top villa that we stayed in. So it is basically like one bedroom on the lower level: close and lock you door and remember to bring your key up if you want to go up to the upper level where the living room and balcony is located. My teenager son stayed on an extra bed on the upper level, so every time he needs to take a shower he had to bring his key and clothes and knock at our door…

There was a problem with the folding balcony doors, which was unable to be closed properly, and hence insects could get in during the night and at times it got windy. We noticed this problem when we were shown around the villa, and a technician came to fix it. However, every time after opening the doors the same problem occurred, and we had to call again. In the end we gave up... so everyday after housekeeping, we had a hard time trying to close the doors properly (even housekeeping staff were unable to close it properly after cleaning up the balcony).

The hotel has a lounge at the Cacticlan Jetty Port, which is a very nice touch to guests while waiting for the speedboat transfer to the resort. Unfortunately, on our return journey, the staff at the lounge refused to let us stay there for a while more even though we told them there was still more than one and a half hour before our flight to Manila would depart… In the end, we were stuck at the small airport with only one snack stall for almost 2 hours!

The friendliness of the staff was overwhelming from airport arrival to the front desk to housekeeping to food and beverage personnel. We were always greeted with a smile and salutation. Complimentary shuttle to the DMall/White Beach was a great asset.

The spa was fantastic. We enjoyed an amazing couples treatment which was pure bliss. Spa rooms are essentially private enclaves of relaxation and rejuvenation.

"the hotels opening line is ""welcome to Paradise"" and the hotel is very close but not quite there.

firstly the airport transfer is smoothly organised and helps you run the gauntlet of locals trying to carry your bags and help you and the speedboat crossing seems a lot smoother than the regular crossing.

the hotel is spotless and there are plenty of willing staff to help , we were lucky enough to by staying for a wedding and had got deluxe seaview rooms which did have great views - the rooms are large with a stunning bathroom ( have stayed in smaller hotel rooms ) a good balcony with sunbed - wifi , complimentary water and stuff for washing your clothes are great add ons for travellers.

there is a shuttle bus down to D Mall ( for bars / restaurants ) regularly with the last one back at 1.15 in the morning

golf buggies run you about the resort and can be ordered

food and drink in the resort is pricey but if you can afford the hotel then the difference wont be that great

the beaches and pools are wonderful with a beach bar that does have a happy hour in the evening

the buffet breakfast was tremendous and caters for all tastes

my only gripe was that sometimes the service level was very inconsistent

"The hotel and its grounds are beautiful. It has two lovely beaches and a large pool all with plenty of loungers.
We stayed in a standard room which was very nice. Super comfy king sized bed. The bathroom didn't offer as much privacy as I'd have liked though.
The buffet breakfast was fantastic. Really tasty with lots of choice.
The only other place we ate in resort was the beach bar. The food was nice but you can get much much better food in D Mall for much less money. The coconuts they sell are way overpriced and they cleverly don't tell you the price on the menu.
The resort offers regular shuttle busses into the town centre which is a great service. The town is much more fun than in resort.
During our stay we had problems with the documentation our travel company had given us for this hotel. Front desk staff were more than useless. It was like talking to a brick wall and management refused to see us.
For a high end resort and large company we expect good customer service but in fact we got the opposite from front desk staff.
I have stayed in both budget hotels and high end resorts previously and have never ever been treated so badly. We had a bit of paper missing and were treated like criminals because of it.

"Start with the positive - beautiful pool and beach. Fantastic service when transporting from airport to hotel and vice versa. Quiet and peaceful. Beautiful property all the way around. They upgraded me to a premium ocean view room which was nice.
However (only one negative really but if you are used to Western service levels in allegedly 5 star hotels then you will want to know this)- the pool and beach side food and beverage service was literally terrible. In 5 days of laying by that beautiful pool and beach I was asked exactly 3 times if I needed something to drink. Every other time I had to flag someone down and then wait forever. Other people were saying the same. And it is not an employee problem. It is a management problem as the staff was trying somewhat but there just wasn't enough of them. Not acceptable at all.

"I am an executive for a german luxury automobile company and have been to many five star hotels around the world....but it really comes down to one thing, the people...the service i received at the Shangri-la was unbelievable by the entire staff...but one individual made my stay a true ""unforgettable experience"" His name is Eric Dollosa. Eric was the butler assigned to me for my stay at the shangri-la. I stayed in a pool villa (which i highly recommend) and Eric settled me in and made me feel at home..The villa came with a cell phone with Eric's number so he could be reached at any time...This experience alone was enough for me to be totally impressed...The first thing i wanted to do once i was settled in was to go across the island to meet a friend of mine...So what did i do ? I picked up the villa cell phone and called Eric..I explained to him what i wanted to do, and gave him the address...expecting for him to maybe refer me to a shuttle or taxi...Well, i found out my friend lived in Lezo, which Eric explained to me is a different island...I didn't know what to do or how to get there. Five minutes later Eric was at my door..He said he would be off work soon and would arrange the trip for me, and he offered to go with me to insure my safe travels...WOW !!! Two taxis, two boat rides later i arrived to meet my friend in Lezo...i visited my friend for about four hours and Eric stayed the entire time (which really ending helping because this was a really remote village with no taxis) When it was time to go Eric already had a driver lined up..a few hours later i was back in my pool villa....I then went on to have two awesome days at the resort....but something was missing,my friend in Lezo...guess who i called ? yep...Eric. He arranged the same driver and boat to bring my friend Rachel to visit me, so she could experience, THE BEST RESORT WITH THE BEST BUTLER........Eric thank you so so much...and thank you Shangri-la for having someone like that on your staff......",Staff:Location
"We spent three nights at the Shangri-La Boracay Resort and Spa in a one bedroom villa! Our flight got diverted at the last minute so you can imagine my surprise that a hotel representative was waiting for us at Kalibo. He took care to ensure that we were in a private van to Caticlan Airport. Check in was swift and easy. One glitch however, the air conditioning was not working in our original villa. They were quick to act and move us to another villa. The staff was friendly and took an interest in how our stay was. None of the staff ever walked by with out saying hello and hoping that we were enjoying our stay. The pool villa was amazing. Our own private oasis!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"After reading alot of reviews and suggestions on where to spend our vacation, we both decided on Shangri-La in Boracay. Our experience was simply amazing here! Every detail, no matter how small, was carefully thought out. The rooms were beautiful and very clean. We stayed in the Seaview Suite which was a perfect choice, offering a close walk to the beautiful beach, which surprisingly, seemed to be very under-crowded considering how many guests we saw at the resort. The jacuzzi was a HUGE hit and the food at Vintana and Rima were simply delicious. French toast at Vintana was the BEST!!! but they offer variety each day to please everyone. In our opinion, Shangri-la has perfected the art of customer service and their staff was beyond reproach. PS...definitely take the Sunset Cruise around the island. You and your special someone will love it!",Food:Staff:Location
"One word to sum up our stay at the Shangri-La is….magnificent. Why? For many reasons like location, service, food, amenities, and overall experience. Everyone from the cleaners who tidied our room to the dive instructors to the chefs were accommodating and thoughtful. We loved the pool and beach team who pampered us with cold drinks and fresh fruit throughout the hot days. Dave and Cheeto were so kind and always smiling. Aya, the beachside masseuse was so animated and funny and gave great foot and leg rubs.
My fiancé and I travel a lot it’s our hobby and passion to explore as much as the world as possible and as rule we stay in hotels that are equal or better to our home accommodations. The Shangri-La at Boracay was exceptional and without a doubt one of the best properties we’ve stayed.
The location of the Shangri-La Boracay resort is in the most perfect part of the island. Private beaches with great snorkelling and sunsets. Most sunsets end with a fire show and live music where all the guest gather at the beachside bar to watch and listen. We’ve seen so many sunsets around the world but these were so perfect they reminded us of beautiful artwork that hang in the galleries.
Food & Drinks were good and pretty well priced whilst many reviews say is overpriced, compared to other hotels in Philippines we thought it was very reasonable. For example a pint of beer was $3. We were a captive audience they could have easily got away with charging double that but didn’t. Rima, the Italian style restaurant had some great pasta and fresh fish dishes but the best was the chocolate fondant with gorgonzola cheese. I know sounds a little weird but believe me it’s good. The morning breakfast brunch has food for everyone….eggs anyway you can think, made to order oats, juices, pancakes and so much more and great views!!
But what really made it special were the people working there. We were lucky enough to spend quite a lot of time with them because my boyfriend had planned to propose to me whilst there – which by the way, was a perfect setting – very romantic.
He had made some plans before we arrived, dealing with the brilliant Holly, who was always very helpful. When we got to the resort, I met with the GM, Shadi, who worked with Holly to deliver on what I can only say was a proposal plan that far surpassed anything I could have imagined. The end result included 13 members of staff, some providing flowers as we walked to the dinner, chefs, and others laying on a wonderful evening.
The team were always there to keep me up to date and they basically took over and let me enjoy my holiday!
Some of the things they organised:
1) The resort had run out of oysters. They searched the island until they found them for the special evening
2) They had team meetings planning out every detail and even painted steps leading to the dinner white…. Every detail was thought of!
3) Specialized menu of my favourite foods.

In the end it truly was an experience of a lifetime in Boracay and the resort and the island will always hold a special place in our hearts. A special thanks to Shadi the GM who went above and beyond to make this an amazing memory.",Food:Location:Staff
"This is one of the loveliest and best designed luxury hotels that I've ever stayed in. The only blot on the experience was some of the service which for the price we paid for the Beach Villa was good but not up to the standard would expect for the price i paid.

Let's start with the positives:

- the pools and restaurants are very well designed with lots of nooks and crannies and huge amount of space to give you freedome and privacy
- the private beach is fantastic, lovely sea and plenty of space
- the spa is vast and offers excellent choices and service
- the best restaurant by a long way was the Italian one Rima with excellent food and amazing service
- the pool and sea side restaurant Cielo served easy food and drinks
- the sunset were incredible
- the lobby lounge bar was amazing for sunset
- the kids play areas were incredible and the staff at the kids play areas were amazing
- the private BBQ on our private beach in our beach villa was extremely romantic and beautiful

Now onto the negatives:

- when we arrived they gave us the worst garden villa possible, no views, no garden, a public driveway in front of our pool so no privacy - nothing like the hotel website
- my partner complained and asked to be moved - she was promised a call back which never came. Next day i complained again and funnily enough no other garden villa was available but the Beach Villa was but that was 50% more expensive. I had little choice but to accept this upgrade and pay the difference. I did however note that many of the garden villas in the complex were not occupied so wonder if this was a tactic to get us to upgrade
- we visited the seafood restaurant, Sirena, and picked out a quiet, romantic table overlooking the valley. we arrived two days later for our meal only to find that the only table in the whole of the restaurant occupied was ours. there was no record of our booking despite the person writing it down at the time. we insisted they moved the people in our table as had booked 48 hours beforehand and reluctantly they did
- the butler was next to useless in fact he caused more time and confusion that it was actually easier to avoid him and go direct as we couldn't rely on him and he disappeared when we actually did need him - don't bother with one
- the airport is horrendous, really horrible and the road from airport to harbour is dangerous and busy
- the breakfasts on the whole were good but they couldn't get their head around my simple requests for scramble eggs and smoked salmon and eggs benedict - sometimes i got nothing and had to go looking for my order as despite explaining several times they seemed out of their depth and would rather forget about the order than ask again and another time I got eggs florentine with sauce despite asking for eggs benedict without sauce
- the place is a wedding mecca, there are weddings on every day - this would be fine apart from the fact that when you sit in the Sirena bar and watch the sunset and hear not one, not two but three lots of music all at the same time it becomes ridiculous and not befitting a luxury resort
- one source of music was the live music from the wedding the second source of music was from the beach which bizarrely was next to the wedding venues and therefore you do wonder why wedding couples don't complain and why the hotel allow this to happen, the third source of music was the restaurant itself but there music was drowned out by the beach music was dominated the whole resort and the wedding music which was on the beach and next to the Sirena restaurant - the only way to avoid this was to go to the Italian restaurant in the treetops

For the amount of money that this holiday cost none of these service issues should have happened. I wouldn't have expected these issues at a normal 4 star or 5 star hotel let alone a super luxury beach resort like this one.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Everything said about the beauty of the place and its location is true. It's an idyllic hideaway, yet it still has room for improvement, especially when it comes to facilities and service. It would be ideal, since the rooms are spread out and are quite a walk from the lobby/restaurant, if there are more locations/choices where one can take one's meals in the resort. The room is big, with a big TV, a tub and separate shower and toilet stalls, but is not spectacular.
Also, sadly, there was but one staff ready to welcome us in the reception -- after a four-hour delay at the airport in Manila -- so it took quite a while before members from our group were ushered into our rooms. On checkout, one of our colleagues' bags almost got left behind in spite of constant reminders to the staff and corresponding assurance that we can leave the bags inside the rooms and they will take care of them.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The Boracay Shangri-La is a beautiful place to stay on one of the world's premier beach islands. The rooms (I stayed in just a normal room, not one of the private houses) are very comfortable and well appointed with great views of the ocean and beach. The private Shangri-La beach is great and close to the pool, lap pool and bar. It's not difficult to get to the main Boracay beach if you want a huge variety of...everything...the hotel runs shuttle buses back and forth every half hour. I ate at a number of the hotel cafes as well as a few places in town and will say that the hotel has great food...better than anything I had in town. That being said, the cafes in town are a totally different experience and a lot of fun as well. I would come back to Boracay in a heartbeat, it was one of my favorite island destinations so far, and when I do I will also come back to Shangri-La.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We decided to splash out and stay at the Shangri La as our last stop on our honeymoon. Even though it stated on our booking that it was our honeymoon, none of the staff ever acknowledged it or made a fuss over us like other hotels we had stayed in did which was disappointing.

When checking in we were granted early check in at 12pm (we had arrived at 8am after travelling 12 hours and being awake for 24 hours). Around 11.30 we asked if the room was ready and they said yes however, they couldn't let us in until 12pm because it was their policy. This was quite upsetting for someone who had been awake for over 24 hours and I queried why this was the case. Eventually they got permission to let us in 'early' (11.50am by this time).

The resort itself is amazing incredible views, pools and beaches. It costs to do any activities like paddle boarding, snorkeling or kayaking which is disappointing seeing as though you pay so much to stay there. The meals and drinks are resort prices so we went into D-Mall most nights for cheaper dinners but spent our last night at the beach restaurant at the resort which was lovely (plus you it was happy hour at the time).

Overall a nice stay, we just hoped for more since we had really gone over our budget to stay there.",Value for money:Staff
My family of four recently spent 6 nights at the Shangri-La staying in Villa 12 which was simply amazing. From the moment that we were met at the airport and shown aboard the private launch for the trip to the resort it was like being whisked into another world. The waters around Boracay are turquiose blue with white sand beaches. The main town and beach are full of carzy bars and restuarants that are great to visit but it was sooo great to be able to head back to the serenity and luxury of the Shangri-La. Our Villa and other hotel facilities are way way above the competition !! The staff were so friendly and accomodating and nothing was too much bother for them. My two daughters loved the water sports centre and Barbara and Chris took wonderful care of them in instructing them to achieve their Open Water Dive Certificate !! The breakfast buffet was probably the best I have ever encountered with more options then you could ever want. It was a particularly nice touch that every morning one of the staff would walk around the restuarant in native dress offerring dinners local treats. It was also refreshing to see the General Manager Ester or her Asst Mgr Shadi regularly walking around the hotel interacting with guests to ensure that we were having a wonderful time. We now can't wait for our next visit to Shangri-La Boracay,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Firstly the ShangriLa really cannot be compared to other hotels in and around Boracay. 1 because its a resort not a hotel and 2 because it is located in the most stunning and tranquil location. Certainly the highlight of our 7 night Boracay trip having spent a few nights on station 2 to get the best of both worlds. The resort has a good variety of bars and restaurants along with plenty of activities. But best of all is has two stunning beaches. Sunset drinks are a must! The rooms are spacious. They could definitely do with a pillow menu that's probably my only negative comment. Oh and our meal at Sirena was poor for a five star establishment.
Yes this resort is located away from it all about 30 minutes from the main shopping area but there is a complimentary shuttle back and forth. Of course the prices are more expensive but it's a given considering the location and services provided.
For us this was a must for our Boracay trip. We loved it! If you stay in 5 star resorts this is the only choice for you. Staff were super helpful and friendly!
The resort could do with a few adjustments here and there to improve the 5 star experience but overall we were very happy!",Location:Food:Value for money
"I have been to Boracay around 6 or 7 times in my lifetime. I stayed in Shangri-La Boracay twice (2011 in May 2009)

My first stay was with the family of my wife. Her dad prefers Shangri La properties when he organizes meetings and when they have guest from abroad which made him a special customer. When Shangri-La Boracay opened we were invited to stay for 2 - 3 days. We arrived in Caticlan Airport and was tranferred via private boat to the hotel. We stayed in 3 deluxe rooms. The staff are friendly. They even prepared the game room for the guest to view the Pacquiao vs Hatton fight.

My second stay was for a honeymoon with my wife in 2011. We stayed for 3-4 days and used the seaview suite and tree house villa. The butler service of the tree house villa was superb. I really loved the private jacuzzi.

Main drawback in staying at Shangri-La Boracay is that you needed transportation to go the main beach which is always the highlight of any trip to boracay.

The Shangri-La property in Boracay has a ""private"" access to puca beach and the swimming pool is the best from all my travels.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"i won't comment already on how luxurious the hotel is and the amenities they offer, because it's a given fact already.

level of comfort staying here is through the roof. once we were picked up from d'mall, everything else was provided for. it took about 30 to 40-minute travel from d'mall to the hotel. it was almost like a trek going there. but we were greeted by the beauty of the hotel. it was a huge, and let me repeat, a huge resort/hotel. It was so quiet, that all of us whispered not to disturb anyone.

i could have taken about 10,000 pictures on a 5-minute walk going to the room because of the intricate designs of the hotel.

if you went to boracay to party your entire stay, then look somewhere else, save those dollars. because this is really far from the parties.

but if you went to boracay to find the definition of relaxation, this is really a perfect place to get away from the busy life, really relax, and find solitude.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Very nice place far enough away from the busy main stretch of Boracay but still close enough if he do need to go for supplies. The hotel grounds are beautiful and have 2 beaches one of witch is private, the grounds are well maintained and spread out nicely so it never seems to busy the only negative here would be if you didn't like walking you could get frustrated but we enjoyed the walks through the grounds and there were always the over sized golf buggies that were frequently moving between the ""buggy stations"" if you didn't feel like walking. Pool was great with plenty of lounges in the shade with nice shallow sections shaped for relaxing, there were plenty of life guards on duty for little ones and the only suggestion here would be maybe an adulds only section to get away from the kids for a bit. To me the private beach was probably the best, the beach wasn't too kid friendly so it was a little quieter and there always plenty of sun lounges and different combinations of seating (some with 2 others with 3 and 4 and so on), this beach is right near the pool so if you feel like a dip in the pool it's not too far. Only thing that I found could do with improvement here would be the food and bar service in the pool and beach area as most of the times you would have to go to the bar to order food or drinks, it wasn't the staff being lazy but seemed more like a lack of staff as they were always busy, but the did make the time to walk around providing bottled water and fruit sticks or fruit shakes and that was nice.
Food we had was good, nothing spectacular. Breakfast had a large selection and the staff here were great, they would come around and offer to go get food for you, while another would walk around with warm croissants, there were 2 egg stations and a lot of things were changed daily, there some nice seats outside with water views. We had room service a couple times and the was good but did take a while to come. Wifi was quick and reliable, staff very friendly and helpful and over all great place with very good service, very nice rooms (with bath and separate shower) with all the usual Shangri-La's inclusions but not as good as other Shangri-La's, a couple minor improvements would make this place the ultimate place to stay. If going back to Boracay I would stay here again for sure though.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"1. Travel/commute to get to Boracay is inevitably long and tiresome! Delays were experienced both ways by both airlines! I think it's the general organisation of the Philippines airports that is not good Of course I understand that it's no fault of Shangri-La - but just a warning to future customers of the inevitable delays! I would highly recommend direct flights if there are any at all!

2. Shangri-La Boracay resort was fabulous. We've stayed in a few Shangri-la resorts around Asia, and I feel the service in the Philippines resorts are much superior! I think the Filipinos are very hospitable and their English is very good so the communication is great with them. Our one bedroom villa with pool was so perfect for our family of 4 (incl 2 kids aged 7 and 9) - having the private pool in our private garden was very special. We often ate in room dining meals in the cabana in our garden. It was also very close to the beach, and large garden area for the boys to kick around their soccer ball. The villa was huge so fitted in everyone very well. The personalised butler service great. They are the only resort I have found that also keep replenishing fruit/snacks/drinks every day and complimentary too! The package we got was well worth it too with discounted restaurant bills, free use of non-motorised equipment, spa voucher and especially the free laundry on the last day. The easter weekend had a full house but it didn't feel like it was overcrowded at all being on such a big estate.

(We did like the look of the treetop villas - they had a great view of the ocean. Although they said it wasn't safe for kids - but you could sign a waiver if you wanted to have your kids stay there with you). They seemed more private and some of them had their own pools. But overall for us, we were glad and preferred that we were at our villa with the garden. There were some hotel rooms on this treetop side - definitely more quiet and private with better views than the hotel rooms near us)

Our kids (aged 7 and 9) really loved the Entertainment Centre at the resort (they didn't even go to Adventure Zone - too young for them). At the Entertainment Centre, there were movie nights, air hockey, basketball and computers which they loved playing with. We left them there on their own a few times to do our own things!

Rima restaurant was fabulous (set menu and a la carte) and quite a special atmosphere.

The Sirena seafood restaurant was good. We really liked picking their fresh seafood on display to be cooked for us.

We also enjoyed kayaking along the coast from their beaches.

3. The local town/White Beach was good - although wouldn't say the food was the greatest! Good atmosphere (although slightly rowdy at night especially on weekends). We enjoyed eating at the Lemon Cafe in d'mall. Cyma was just ok. We were recommended Dos Mestizos (2nd/3rd Station) by our butler and we thought that was great! We enjoyed doing nice long strolls along the White Beach - especially during the evenings. Was nice to swim there too during the day.

4. The Puka Beach nearby was nice to visit too. Would not recommend the restaurants as they don't look too safe to eat at - but a cool drink was enjoyed!

5. We took a snorkelling cruise with Scotty's company (Shangri-la's in-house service provider). The waters were so clear, and there were so many fish/corals to see! Definitely one of the best snorkelling we've done in Asia so far!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"When you arrive at the resort ferry terminal, they welcome you with ""Welcome to Paradise"" which is a big call, but they get seriously close to it!
Wonderful big rooms with solid doors that give you complete peace and quiet, a wonderful breakfast buffet for all tastes, the tree-house Italian restaurant is wonderful to watch the sunset. The main pool area is beautiful and fun for the kids. The beach is OK, but there are nicer beaches on the island if you want beach more than pool. The kids club is a huge hit, with the best staff and a constant stream of activities.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Great location, private beach that is very clean - no seaweed, comfy sunbeds, very nice pool with an irregular shape to make it blend into the nature - lovely little spots in the pool for sunbathing half in water... food overall very good - i wouldn't have said no to a few more options of cheese and cold cuts at breakfast but totally ok and lots of other things to compensate. The hotel is set very nicely in nature, it is robust and solid but blends in well. the rooms are spacious and comfortable - however cleanliness could be better - the bed linen and all the necessary items were squeaky clean but dust in places like the dvd player, inside the cupboards, the top of the safe etc. was not a nice sight. Staff are generally very good, pleasant - only two were really annoying - one had a faker smile and was totally incapable of doing anything and had us wait for ages - the other at the beach was a sort of gestapo telling us not to occupy too much space (the beach was empty and we were occupying 2 large sunbeds) but things like this happen in all organisations - god knows howmany people work there so there are bound to be a few rotten eggs. The service at the becah bar can be improved - ordering a dring then actually getting it takes at least 40 minutes in happy hour - but overall the shangrila is a great place to stay if you want to be near the crowds (7minute tuk tuk ride) and have peace and quiet in luxury.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"We had a fantastic time at Shangri-La. It's a long trip to get there but once you have arrived at the jetty paradise begins. We arrived at Kalibo airport and Shangri-La staff was already waiting there for us. Staff in the hotel is very friendly and we had a very nice, clean and beautiful decorated room. But the high light are the beaches with fine white sand and clear blue water. It was amazing to sit on the beach, listening to the good cover band playing and seeing the sun ""disappearing"" in the ocean in the evening. Selfdom felt soo relaxed and far away from everyday stress.

Breakfast was very good. We had a private dinner at the beach which was outstanding. We used the shuttle to go down town which was sometimes crowded, in particular in the evening on the way back. But the staff in the down town area was very helpful and always tried to get the people back to the hotel as quickly as possible.

I went diving with my daughter. Equipment is very good and the dive masters are very good. As a ""once every year"" diver I felt safe and well looked after. Some of the dive sites are close to the hotel so it is possible to do two dives in the morning and then spent time with the family in the afternoon on the beach.",Location:Food:Staff
We stay in this beautiful hotel over easter time and we like it very much. The beach is clean and amazing. The staff is very friendly and well trained. I recoomend a sea view room which is beutiful.

Pool was nice and the private beach was clean... Someone said that it is very far away from the downtown, which is true, but the shuttle was available frequently till late. I don't think it would become an issue unless you love to stay in downtown. Everything was great at Shangri-La!",Staff:Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities
"I've been to Boracay many times but this visit to Shangrila was a first.

1. The staff are great and pleasant to deal with. Special mention goes to the man at the airport who really helped to try get us on a different flight when our Cebu Pacific flight got cancelled, the lovely nurse Kristine who babysitted my daughter on 2 occasions and Cheeto the beach staff who always went out of their way to help out guests.

2. The facilities are very good. I love that I have 2 beach options and that the pool is just next to Banyugan beach and bar. I would rather hangout at the Punta Bunga beach because it is quieter. My daughter absolutely loved the pool and Adventure Club. They also had daily activities for the kids.

3. The breakfast buffet was sumptuous. There was a great selection every time. I always had my mango dose because they're delicious! There was a kids mini-buffet section as well. Vintana Cafe served a simple yet perfect Bagnet for lunch. It was pure bliss for this balikbayan!

4. The rooms were great and I was glad to see that they didn't have individual plastic bottles for the usual hotel toiletries and had dispensers instead. We got a garden view room on the 6th floor and had a refreshing view from the balcony.

5. I wish I had more time to go to their spa because the lady who did my welcome in-room back massage was great!

6. They have a reliable shuttle to Dmall which allowed us to eat and shop outside of the resort.

I will definitely come back again. It was a really relaxing and enjoyable vacation for the family.",Food:Staff:Location
"After several years of not having visited Boracay, my wife and I went there at the urging of our close friends. Shangri La was the property of choice for this weekend break.

While the stay was generally good, the resort was definitely found wanting in several areas if service and food. The staff at the front desk was so eager to sell upgrades and literally took a long time to get us our rooms. First impression down!

It was no better with the concierge desk staff who simply didn't have enough knowledge of the hotel itself and where everything is located. He told us the dive center was 15 minutes by buggy, when it was actually less than 5 minutes on foot.

Boracay itself is disappointing now with too many peopl on the main beach and the evident negative impact of mass tourism on the ecosystem surrounding the island.

Overall, a disappointment and not to be repeated.",Staff:Location:Food
"I am writing to pass on the experience my now fiancé and I had when we were on vacation at the shangri la boracay from March 12 until March 20 this year.

We have travelled the world and stayed in many wonderful resorts and hotels, but we can say none of them come close to the shangri la boracay!

From the moment we stepped foot on the pier at shangri la the service was nothing but perfection as the staff were extremely welcoming and professional.

The resort is absolutely stunning which assures a relaxing time is had there.

But what made our stay even more special was the service we received from the day we arrived until the day we left, as these personal touches are what makes all the difference to a vacation and ensures it is a life lasting memory and the reason I proposed to my then girlfriend as I knew it was the perfect location for it and after the service and friendliness we received I could not have chosen a better place to have done this.

In particular my fiancé and I would like to say a very special thank you to the below people:

- Firstly to Shadi Refai, who we can not thank enough for the personal touches, the warm and welcoming conversations, the hospitality he personally put in, the high level of service he provided and his friendship on our stay as Shadi really made our stay one we will never forget and a fantastic impression of what the shangri la represents. We can not thank Shadi enough for what he done for us.

Shadi is a true asset to the Shangri La.

- To the bar staff who were always extremely polite, friendly, efficient and for their conversations with us as they really made us feel welcome and relaxed. In particular we would like to thank Vincent, Mark, Alfie, Aries, Rica and Nicholson

- Chef Chad and our waiter Sean who ensured we had the dining experience we will never forget on our private BBQ evening where I actually proposed to my now fiancé.

- Mr Sonny Robert Dela Cruz was always so polite, professional, willing to help and a genuinely lovely man who I am proud to say I keep in contact with as have formed a friendship with. Nothing was to hard for Sonny.

- The hosts and especially Holly who always had a smile on her face and assisted us with any queries we had no matter how big or small, she was fantastic.


Without the outstanding people and now friends mentioned above our trip would have still been fantastic, however having been fortunate to meet the above people our trip was absolutely perfect and has now etched a life long memory, become a very special place in our hearts and a destination we cannot wait to return to.

We will and have recommended the Shangri La Boracay to all of our friends, family and colleagues as we know they will have the same amazing time we had and that it will be a special place for them as well.

So again thank you to the Shangri La Boracay and in particular the above people for such a beautiful vacation.",Staff:Food
"When I started researching hotels about a month ago in Boracay I had my eye on the Shangri-La but was very hesitant to book because of the price. I kept searching for other hotels that seemed just as nice but my gut kept taking me back to the Shangri-La. So we decided to splurge and start out our vacation out at the resort. I have absolutely no regrets and our experience at this resort was top notch!

The private speedboat transfer was so convenient and it was great not having to deal with the public ferry and crowds at the Caticlan port. The resort was beautifully manicured and every single staff person made you feel right at home and welcome. Take advantage of the happy hour on the beach while watching the sunset and live band....2 for 1 drinks is always nice!

Breakfast is amazing and I love that it extends until 11am which is a nice touch for those that like to sleep in. If you are a gym person please take advantage! All new modern cardio machines with TVs and the selection of weight machines is a gym go-ers haven!

"Was accused as gatecrasher on our return from D'mall tour, even followed us to the pool with a malign looks by staff. No buffet lunch or dinner during our stay.

So close to white beach when you want to grab the shuttle you can be the the heart of everything in just a few minutes. Best of both worlds...high class resort and local for shopping and dinner

The only thing I would have to say about shangrila is the beds are very firm/hard. Roll away was just springs....and once it got busy the breakfast service suffered a little bit.

Love that the beach is right at the pool...however the pools are all salt water.

"Oh my Shangri-La! This hotel sets the standard for what a five star should be-and in the Philippines the other hotels should be taking notes. It has a certain elegance, class, and sophistication that is priceless. What makes it special are the staff who are extremely kind, polite, helpful, and always smiling. The lobby cafe is great for reading or working a bit with a nice coffee, the Verana cafe is great for an ice cream cake(Black forest one is great) or enjoying a pastry. The pool is fantastic for sunset where you have the live music and the dancers to keep you entertained. I think the dancers are the cutest thing I have ever seen in the Philippines. They are so adorably happy that it's contagious and I love their costumes and the fire dance. Dinner at Serena sitting and overlooking the ocean and the villas is amazing. There was a small issue with my meal and it was handled my the manager with extreme care and great communication to serve myself and other guests in the future. The level of service definitely meets the five stars. Unfortunately, I didn't make it to the spa or Rima, but there is always a next time.
Don't even hesitate for a second on this hotel because it's in a league of it's own. And the only significant concern I have with that you can't quite compare to something this great. Any hotels you stay in after this point won't quite measure up because it spoils you visually and through the ultimate experience.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Had 6 days with the family here over the February half term. Its a bit of a slog to get here - overnight in Manilla, and then an hours flight to Caticlan, then 25 mins in the speedboat! But well worth the effort! Shangri La take care of you from the moment you reach Caticlan - they handle the luggage and then transport you to their private lounge before you catch the speedboat. On arrival at the resort, you are greeted at the jetty and then whisked away by buggy. We stayed in an ocean villa, number 12. I remember reading one review which said that the villas had no ""wow"" factor. Well, I don't know where he usually stays, but in my opinion there was no shortage of wow! Extremely spacious; well furnished and with great views - not sure what else you could want! The gardens were beautiful too although the pool was a little on the chilly side in February. Its all extremely beautiful and very relaxing. Villas come with butler service - we had Jeff on the first day and then Vincent for the rest of our stay. These guys are great and they will arrange everything for you if you wish - its up to you. We had a couple of days when the butler phone would not work but I gather that this is quite a common issue with the network provider. One thing to note with the 2 bed villas if you are planning to stay with small children - the main bedroom is actually separate from the rest of the villa. Check with the resort before you book. Wifi all over the resort is excellent. You can Skype while in the sea! The resort is big and while you can wait for golf buggies to move you around, we enjoyed walking the property. There are 2 beaches, one has less weed and stones than the other. The pool is lovely, perfect temperature and big enough to not seem crowded at any time. Water sports are available (free of charge if you are in a villa). There were also zumba and pilates classes and a good gym. Kids are well looked after and in particular the games room is fantastic - air hockey, fuse ball, chess, books, basketball shooting, ping pong, dvds to hire. Even the most bored of teenagers would have something to to do here! We ate at Rima, the Italian, which was excellent times. The Vintana breakfast spread is enormous, one of the best I have ever seen. Sadly the buffets organised on the beach for both Valentines and Chinese new year were not of the same standard and were very expensive for what was on offer (although the setting was spectacular). We had all our lunches at Cielo by the pool. The food was always good, but the service is very slow. This is in no way the fault of the staff - as I could see it, the problem is that they have so far to walk to put the orders in, get drinks from the bar and collect the food when it is ready. What this means for the customer is that there is often no staff out front. The staff work really hard to keep up - you would often see them running - but really a system needs to be put in place for them to submit orders without having to be absent for so long. Other slight service issues were trying to book a restaurant on Valentines Day (we were told by reception we couldn't do this) and trying to get a decent drink at the lobby bar, where service was painfully slow and the drinks decidedly poor. Drinks at the bar overlooking the bay, on the other hand were good and the setting is spectacular. Overall, service at this resort is very, very good with nothing too much trouble. There are regular shuttle buses into town, which is worth a look, only 15 minutes away. We had a wonderful week here and this is easily the best beach resort I have ever stayed at.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We had been enjoying ourselves on white beach, but arranged to stay 3 days at Shangri-La over my birthday. They picked us up at our hotel and it is about a fifteen minute drive from Station 2 to the tranquility of the Shangri-La. It is a large property and depending on where you are going you may need a buggy (golf cart) to get around. They have many roaming the property. It took me a day to get the layout in my head it is so large.

They have two beaches, but most of our time was spent by the one by the pool. Plenty of staff were always ready to help whether with food or drinks or getting snorkeling gear, and they were extremely friendly. WiFi included in your room rates and accessible everywhere on the property.

The room was large and comfortable with a big balcony and a place to lay down on the balcony. Bathroom had both a shower and a tub.

I used the gym a few times. Very large - with treadmills, ellipticals, stair climbers and plenty of free weights. The exercise machines included tv's and staff was always there with headphones.

The breakfast buffet was probably the best I have had anywhere. Huge selection, really good food.

They have free shuttles going every hour to white beach, every half hour in the evening. Sometimes there are too many people waiting and it may take two shuttles before you get on. If you don't want to wait you can ask them to get a trike for 150p. Depending on the lineup may not be a bad idea.

I came back to my room in the afternoon on my birthday and the house keeping staff had decorated it. This was a cute touch and appreciated.

When we went to leave they took us to the Caticlan airport on a speed boat avoiding all the traffic on the overly busy main road on Boracay. The person who took us to the airport also arranged for us to get on an early flight reducing time at the airport. They have a room at the airport which also is a little more relaxing as it is quieter.

Overall it was a relaxing stay which is what I wanted. The Shangri-La is my favourite hotel change and they more than lived up to my expectations.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"This was easily the most spectacular place to stay on Boracay. It's on the far side of a hill, so all you can see is the resort, so its totally separate from the less pleasant sights, sounds and smells that are common on the other side of the island. The staff were always helpful but not always as friendly as other places. We found them a little patronising and the security staff did not like us wandering around looking at plants or the fishpond or doing activities that weren't on the hotel's 'list of activities'. The two beaches that the property fronts onto are spectacular and are kept exclusively for the use of shangri la guests. There are no peddlers to bother you and the rooms were very quiet to sleep at night. It is great for couples and families if you like swimming and relaxing. It is quite far away from shops and nightlife although there is a free shuttle that runs hourly into the mall area. Another good thing was that there was free wifi that was easily accessible from almost anywhere within the grounds of the whole resort, which is huge. The gym here was also nicer and much better equipped than anywhere else I had stayed in the phillipines.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Place was amazing and really talking about the lobby, the rooms the ambiance it was really almost paradise. I will not have second thoughts to come back and stay in your hotel. Only thing I have a beef with is the food. Your food is not only super expensive but does not taste good. We had dinner at Cielo and paid more than 15,000.00 pesos for a tasteless chicken that I needed to ask the server for some seasoning., The risotto tasted bland and the rest of the meal was nothing to brag about. I do not mind spending big bucks on food as long as they taste good. I love your hotel and would rather have my meals there than to go down to station 1 and 2 for my meal.
Please improve on your food and it will be Paradise.",Food:Value for money
"While there are many new up and coming establishments coming up in Boracay, Shangri-la continues to be the best in terms of location, facilities and customer service.

"Shangrila lives to their meaning, and their Boracay property is simply the best among their properties in the south. It is a private Island that I should call as paradise island. Simply because everything is totally magical.

Just back from an amazing 4 days at the Shangri La in Boracay. Fantastic resort and staff we cannot speak highly enough of.

"We stayed here for Chinese New Year. The hotel was at full capacity but you did not feel it so much as the hotel is large and the staff did a fantastic job.

Just like many of the other reviews, the property, location, service, rooms, views, facilities, etc. are all impeccable and therefore it is a top score.

However, wast is not a perfect stay as the restaurants on the property are really lacking. It was strange as the included breakfast was fantastic and the pool / beach side dining was good but the dinners we had at the resort were not good and they were very expensive. My partner and I like to have good food and don't mind paying for it but we had dinner at the buffet (very average), the seafood restaurant (not impressive) in the trees and the Italian restaurant (good but not up to par with the prices they charge).

If the dinner options were a bit better, it would have been a 100% perfect stay, but instead, it was a 90%.",Food:Value for money:Location

Facilities at the resort are first-class - the pool was amazing, service at the private beach was excellent, the fitness and entertainment centre was well appointed plus the complimentary activities offered to guests was excellent. The food was also of a good standard, with a large selection of international choices at the buffet breakfast, casual dining options at the pool and a choice of fine dining as well. The only minor hiccup on our stay was on check-out when a surcharge was applied to our bill for the return transfer because it was before 6am. We had not previously been told about this surcharge however the issue was dealt with appropriately by staff.

"It's indeed the best resort in Boracay, with a beautiful private beach, and very child friendly. We stayed there for 4 nights with our 2 year old son, in a Deluxe room. The hotel room was nice, spotless clean however the closet didn't close well so on the first night disturbing lights came out from the closet (we didn't call service desk, as our son was asleep already). The resort is a bit unorganized. We booked our room some months ago direct via Shangri-la.com, with a guarantee late check-out and confirmed baby crib. However, when I double checked with them a few days before our arrival they replied to me that there is an additional fee for a late check-out. After a few email communication, they finally confirmed the late check-out.
Upon arrival, we were the first guests arriving the lobby but were the last one to get a room. During check-in a baby crib was confirmed, but when we got in to our room there was not baby crib. Some of the staff (Mr. Ferrie from Seafood restaurant, staff around the pool area) were incredible nice, but others were just so so. For example, when we did the check-out, the guy at the service desk (Mr. Ian?) did not even ask how our stay was. He just showed us the bill, that's it.
We would stay there again, but maybe not during Chinese New Year anymore as it's too expensive for what it is. For a Shangri-La resort, and such an expensive one, I would expect a more attentive staff.",Staff
"My wife and I are world travelers and we've been to some of the best resorts and hotels in the world.
We rated this resort 5 stars last year but this year we encountered a lot of problems with their reservations department which is an absolute insult to all travellers.

Our trip started out with a bad premonition. Shangri-La Reservations informed us that they did not have any resident rate rooms and left it at that. We had to contact them in a different way to book rooms which were still available but at non-resident rates.

Unlike other 5 star resorts in Philippines like El Nido Resorts or Amanpolo they have a no refund policy in booking. So if you have any issues with weather, airlines, illness it's up to the discretion of the resort to issue a refund. For us we had airline issues where the third world airline, Philippines Air was delayed 12 hours for no reason except their own incompetency. DOTC the agency responsible for Air passenger safety considers delays longer than 6 hours a cancellation, but Shangri-La Boracay did not see it that way. They would not consider that a cancellation, even though their government defines it as a cancellation.
We tried to cancel our trip to Shangri-La after 10 hours of waiting but Shangri-La reservation would not hear of it. They left us in a lurch, Cancel and forfeit the whole trip cost or keep waiting in the now shutting down airport.

When we finally arrived at the boat transfer terminal at 1 AM in the morning, the staff was annoyed and put out by our late arrival even though it was not our fault we were 12 hours late in a 1 hour flight from Manila to Caticlan. It was Shangri-La's reservations that would not accept their government's definition of ""inhumane"" treatment hence cancellation after all.

Even the next day when we tried to make reservation for dinner, the reservation staff kept going on and on about how we should have booked earlier because most every restaurant was booked. We informed her that we were planning that but we were delayed 12 hours by Philippines Airlines. I think the restaurants were being booked and filled by guests from neighbouring resorts.

For rest of the trip, the staff were buzzing with excitement over government employees (civil servants) coming to their resort and wasn't too concerned with current guests at the resort.

The staff that recognized us from last year were apologetic about the airline issues we encountered and told us that they were fully aware of airline issues from Manila to Boracay and back. Perhaps that's why they have the No refund policy.
Because other, better resorts in Philippines allow cancellation due to weather, airline, illness or other emergency, it appeared to us that Shangri-La Boracay did not care about our well being.

So we will never return again.
There are better places on this earth and better resorts in this part of the world for the same price. When we had no emergency or last minute issues last year, it was a great stay. But a great resort deserving a 5 star should have contingencies for those few guests that do encounter problems.",Staff:Value for money
"Beauty all around. We spent two nights at shangra-la for a wedding. Stayed in a 4th floor room. Rooms were lovely and large, service good, staff friendly. Breakfast was expansive and varied. The swimming was divine - calm waist deep water for ages. Pool was very well patrolled.
Prices a bit on the costly side - but what you'd expect in such a resort.
Transfers were seamless and comfortable.
Only negative was the inability to get a decent meal in the pool area after 9. We were told we could only have pizza in the pool bar area, and needed to move 20m to another area to get a wider menu. We asked if we could order from the room service menu, but were told not.
When we moved, we were told we could now not get pizza, and could only order from a restricted menu (which was awful). While sat at our table, we watched pizzas being cooked in the oven and be whisked away.

"My fiance (boyfriend at the time our holiday) booked us a 2 week long stay at Shangri-La Boracay in Nov 2014. It was the best holiday of our lives to date! On arrival we were greeted by exceptional staff dedicated to making your stay as perfect as it can be. My partner had arranged a private beach dinner BBQ with the hotel prior to our stay over the phone. The staff planned this event with my partner down to the finest details to take place the first night we arrived. Not one problem, just perfection, they even combed the beach creating us an entrance of snow white steps outlined with fairy lights. We had our own private butler and chef who were better than perfect and just so lovely and friendly. Our meals were exceptional, fine dining on the beach accompanied by love songs playing from our table off an i-phone docking station. The highlight of our already exceptional dinner was when my partner popped the question & at that very moment 2 butlers pulled down screen boards to display a huge sandcastle with the words 'Will you Marry me?' lit up by candles and spot lights. It was the most romantic experience in my life, it was first class! I said 'yes' with tears rolling down my face, it was all too perfect & beautiful. We would give anything to re-experience that night.

The ultimate ""ZEN"" vacation being surrounded by Boracay's natural surroundings of cliffs, beaches and the 'Chi Spa' sanctuary. Best treatment ever! Boracay sand salt body scrub, coconut milk bath & 1 1/2 hour rescue release massage with bananna leaves & hot stones. So exceptional we did a repeat treatment in the same private villa a few days later & spend another full day at the Chi Spa's pool to regain our 'chi'.

Hotel service is absolutely outstanding in every way, 5 star treatment throughout our entire stay. Housekeeping twice a day .... yes you heard me. Marilyn (head of housekeeping) was phenomenal always checking up on us to see if we were fine and leaving us personal hand written notes and chocolates in our room making our engagement holiday so memorable. We were very touched by all the staff with their generosity and personal touches. We will definitely be returning for an anniversary.

Thank you to our Manager Shadi, Marilyn and the housekeeping team, Pearle Charms and all our new friends/staff for taking such great care of us, for being so personable and friendly, for the lovely and romantic dining experiences but especially for the best engagement proposal setting a couple could ever dream of.

Love you all!

"Overall a lovely resort and one of Shangri La's nicer properties. Service was generally very good and all of the staff were very friendly.

Some very minor issues (shouldn't prevent you from staying here but with a 5-star rating these should be addressed):
- many of the public washrooms were lacking toilet paper/had broken soap dispensers
- it was a major ordeal to order food at the pool, often took a few requests of pool staff to get a waiter sent over (the waiter himself was very helpful)
- service at the hilltop bar wasn't great

Otherwise a lovely stay, seamless transition from the airport, gorgeous beach and nice property. Would stay here again.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"The only place to stay is a poolside villa. Otherwise don't bother. The main hotel rooms are boring, uninspiring and rather commercial. The poolside villas, in contrast, are spectacular! But pricey. I was lucky to get a huge bargain because of a quirk in occupancy. We originally made a reservation for a standard room and took one look at it and immediately declined. We ended up getting the poolside villa at a fantastically low price after providing the MOD with a gratuity. The villas offer 24 hour butler service and beautiful accommodations. Philippine mahogany, high ceilings, inset sliding doors, private infinity pool. Indoor and outdoor bathing facilities. You will be spoiled and not want to leave. Only reachable by sea via hotel vessel. - secluded and very exclusive. Try to get villa # 12.
Breakfast buffet is included and the buffet is excellent. They will prepare whatever you want. Sort of like the Lufthansa 1st class lounge. Spectacular secluded grotto pool and large main swimming pools. Definitely go with a companion to share the experience. Our butler provided back and foot massages on request.

"As with most Shangri La hotels, you can't go wrong staying here. The hotel, the pools, the beach are all beautiful. They offer a 2 for 1 special on pool side drinks (I think 4-7 daily). The food was good, but not cheap. As mentioned by another reviewer, there was no kids menu (the manager replied to the review and said there was, but we were told no by the wait staff). So, we did wind up paying $25 for a hamburger that the kids ate nibbles of. We went to the dinner buffet one night, and kids under 10 ate for free, so that worked out well. (We traveled with several families, and this was the only complaint from all of us - no kids menu!)
The Adventure Zone was fun for the kids, but not as extensive as AZ at other locations. They did offer some fun activites for the kids - each moring you could go with the AZ staff to take the golf cart to the spa - they provided baskets of bread to feed the hundreds of large fish in the pond outside the spa. There was also a treasure hunt , and a sandcastle building contest on the beach. The kids really enjoyed the activities, even though they are 9 & 11. My daughter also took a weaving lesson from a local craftswoman in the cultural room right outside the AZ - I did not see it advertised, we kind of stumbled across it. There was a small fee, but she was engaged, learning, and enjoying herself with the one on one lesson for about 2 hours. Well, well worth it.
Each evening, there is a group of giant bats that fly over the beach / pool area at about 6pm - returning to their caves for the night. It was so much fun to watch out for them, to see how many we can spot each night. There is a display about them and more information in the Cultural Room as well. Fun!
The pools weave and wind, the infinity pool at the end provides a great photo drop - looks like my kids are sitting on top of the ocean!. And, from the beach I got some incredible sunset shots with my simple point and shoot camera.
We also did the kyaking trip up along the beach, which was included. A nice activity for the 4 of us, and a great arm work out.
(We split our stay in Boracay between this luxurious Shangri La, and another less glamourous hotel that was near white beach, right near all of the shops and restaurants. That was a great balance. ) Would definitely go to Shangri La again, and recommend to friends as well.",Location:Food:Value for money

"The Shangri-La in Boracay is the best resort on the island by far.

From the moment your plane lands at either Caticlan or Kalibo you are greeted by a warm Shangri-La smile and everything is taken care of. Private boat transport to the resort, being greeted by the local musicians playing their drums, all the way throught check-in and golf buggy transport to your room - what an experience.

I had a great time at the resort during the Christmas break and even though the hotel was surely 100% full it still maintained peace and quiet while everyone made sure you were looked after. The rooms are wonderful, try to get a beach front room on level 5 or 6 which will give you amazing sunset views and the calming song of waves breaking on the beach all night long.

Breakfast buffet was also first class with every taste catered for, and the facilities were very good.

My only 'feedback' concerns children: it would be very good if the hotel had a children section for both breakfast and the pool area. Having loud crying children running around unattended during breakfast, and also running around unattended and jumping (bombing) into the pool area for hours on end just makes things a little less special for us childless folk. Nothing against kids but let them play in their own areas and make everyone happy.

Special thanks (my compliment card) to Rekela (front desk), Chef Francis (private beach dinner), Xavier (Sirena waiter) and Arnel (Airport valet) for making our stay extra special - your service will be long remembered!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

Playroom for the kids (remember to have socks), Entertainment sportsbar-like area with billiards, hoops, ping pong, live sports and a bar. Good alternative for family travellers.
The pool was great. It has 2 beaches, a bit coarse sand than white beach on the other side but still great. Shuttle to and from white beach if you wish to experience a chaotic beach scene. Very near Puka beach, which we loved the most. Just a tricycle ride around 5 mins and your in Boracay as it was before. No hotel there, just a few huts that serve good food and drinks. Try my guy ""Marley"", his hut has a Jamaican flag in front and played Reggae songs in his little radio. He gave us the best service when we came the first time and just had to go back.",Location:Food
"The resort is very nice, lots of green spaces and well taken care of. Too big resort for my taste! Of course, the real highlight is the beach ( actually the beaches, as there are two of them, one is a small cove, which is a private beach and the other beach is longer, semi-private, shared with other neighbouring hotels). The beaches are really nice, clear turquiose waters and powdery white sand.
We stayed in a pool villa, which was really nice, lot of space both indoor and outdoor, nice bed, big bathroom, spacious living room. The villa pool was nice. Gym was well appointed and the staff at the gym very nice. Chi, the spa is nice, good therapists. Our butler, Julius, was a very nice guy, very attentive and nice to our kid, every day he would bring him sweets and make him towel animals. He was the one who serviced our room, also in charge with the turndown sevice and with making dinner reservations for us. Thanks, Julius.
Breakfast was good, plenty of choices, very crowded at breakfast time, especially after 9 a.m., when there were lines at the restaurant entrance.
What was really annoying, was the fact that every day the resort was hosting weddings (sometimes even two weddings per day) and so they closed parts of the resort, especially the long beach (Punta Bunga beach). It all looked very commercial, like they were trying to extort more money than they already did. Every night we listened to live loud music and watched fireworks! Soooo corny! It was a nuisance after all, as we did not really get any peace and serenity, as one expects during one's hoilday!
Our check- out was long, as the staff at front desk wanted to indulge us and let us have the check- out inside our own villa, but then their POS didn't work and so we still had to go to the front desk in the end and make all the payments.
Also, the luggage collection and the trip to the jetty was a fuss. We wanted to walk to the jetty but they insisted we take a buggy. The buggy wouldn't come, so we waited and waited in front of our villa... Then they missplaced one of our suitcases, turned out it had left with the first boat (we were on the second one, as there were a lot of people checking-out that very morning! ) What a mess! all so disorganized!

The villa has its own verandah hot tub and a huge living room which was decorated for Christmas complete with tree! The whole family gathered here for breakfast on Christmas Day and no charge was made by the hotel for providing this. On our 1st day we each had a treatment at the spa and the exfoliation and massage was superb. The indoor games area is very well kitted out with table tennis, pool and air hockey plus basketball play-off games, great for the showers. There was fire dancing on the beach in front of the pool in the evening and an excellent fireworks display over Christmas. As the hotel is built into the hill, they provide buggies to transport guests around the resort which was very handy. A free shuttle to the main Borocay strip runs daily.

"Where to begin....sometimes it is possible to over-research your holidays before hand, and sometimes the reality can be not up to scratch. I took the risk and over researched...reviews etc. However there was no possible way to be disappointed with selecting the 'Shang. We were a family of 5 with 3 x teens.

From the moment of touchdown, everything was taken out of our hands, bags etc disappeared beautifully, and re-appeared in our rooms. The welcome at Caticlan was lovely. The boat trip, one of the last for a few days due to choppy seas, was a good way to arrive. Pretty tricky getting off, due to waves, but all handled it fine. Check in was handled very well in the beautiful lobby lounge.
Our rooms in Hilaga were spacious and airy. We were given 2 rooms adjacent, perfect. The short walk to the beach each morning was gorgeous, always served a lovely espresso by Mark, as I would usually be first on the beach to check out the day. We tended to roll up for the HUGE buffet breakfast at around 10. The resort was at capacity, but we never waited more than 2-3 minutes to be seated. By the 3rd day ,Babe, new exactly the omelette I wanted , never needed to ask. Quite a mind-boggling selection of food, our kids loved it! Nothing like a Gelato to finish brekkie! The beach was closed due to waves and surge a couple of days, but it didn't detract from our time on the beach/pools. Really is lovely on Banyugan, only swam once on Punta Bunga, quite rocky in places.
Pool bar staff all amazing, no waiting, just perfect service. Happy hour was utilised a lot by us. Dining at Rima, and Sirena was a joyful experience. The shuttles to D'Mall were fine, although some nationalities like to queue jump. We actually had fun by getting the tricycles back.
New years celebrations somewhat tamed by the rain, but the lobby lounge was pumping at midnight. All free! Equally, January 1st 5pm, the hotel manager invited us to another celebratory event in the lobby lounge. Superb drink service and food. Felt very priveliged to be there.

The one thing that does stand out for me about this magnificent resort, is the way the well designed grounds tend to swallow up the guests....well it must...it was at max capacity, but wherever you walked, it was as if there was no-one around. Breakfast is the only time you see others in some abundance.
We did have thoughts of a few other Boracay activities, but all lost interest once we got into relax-mode. Which is what we needed, and this place does it in spades. The weather was a bit wet a couple of days, but plenty to do here..
Upon settling our final account we were really surprised how little per day we had spent per person, fantastic, as we sure didn't skimp.

Reading some recent reviews, makes me wonder if they had been staying elsewhere?? Or were so annoyed with the Airlines that they let it affect the holiday.

Anyway, as everyone does....a bit about the travel. Phillipine Airlines, went easy on us, only separating us into 2 flights to arrive on (both only 1.5hrs delayed), and bumped us all off on departure, to be bussed to Kalibo, and put on another delayed flight. We were compensated to the tune of $300, fine, and it didn't muck up any plans. Shangri-La staff assisted us with all of this, and even met us at Kalibo to get us organised on the replacement flight. So no drama at all. I expect it is due to aircraft weight, as we had adhered to the 10kg baggage limit, but all before us in the check-in queue appeared to have at least 30kg's... each!!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"We stayed in the resort during the year end holiday seasons when the resort was at its peak. The transfer to the resort from Caticlan airport was fine, not much hassles after a long journey and a 2 hour delay at Manila airport. We received a warm welcome from the hotel staff at the airport and check in was smooth. We booked the sea view room, the room was ok though we had to agree with the other reviewer that we also experienced the shower gel in the bathroom was almost empty. The breakfast on the first morning was not that great or perhaps we had expected more from a five star hotel. Anyhow, though it was during peak season, we did not have to wait long time to be seated. The beaches are pretty and we could actually do many activities, however unfortunately the weather starting on the third day was not good so we could not enjoy much. The resort has a shuttle to the D'Mall and White Beach area, so it was a good option to spend the day. On the way back to Manila, the resort staff at the airport was really helpful because we changed our flight due to the bad weather. Overall, our stay was ok but if we compare with other hotel at similar level and price, the resort could have done more.",Staff:Food
"It looks like management of the hotel doesn't give a damn about comfort of people staying in it. I really don't know where to begin. 1) 15-20 min queues for breakfast even though there are plenty of empty tables. Staff just can't escort people fast enough. 2) All the staff is absolutely untrained. Yesterday they all were in the fields and today they are trying to work in a 5 star hotel. It's everywhere: in restaurants, on the beach, on the phone, at the reception. Not a single once we got everything we asked for correctly. The most often thing you hear is ""I'm so sorry, maaaaaam"" 3) Prepare to wait for 45 minutes for a cocktail on the beach. Everything is organized in such a way, that beachboys have to bring food and drinks from a distant part of the hotel. 4) Queue for sunbeds. 5) No attemt to create nice atmosphere anywhere,. Starting from check-in which takes place not at the lobby with a nice view, but in the basement with no windows. No nice lounge music, no attempt to entertain guests at all. 6) Mediocre food. 7) Almost every night till late you are forced to listen to very loud and really horrible and disturbing music at weddings and private partieswhich take place at the hotel. You cannot hide from it. 8) Tired and outdated rooms. I can go on, but I think it's more than enough. Fell happy I'm flying back home tomorrow.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"This is a very beautiful hotel on a fantastic beach (actually two). From the moment we arrived at the airport the hotel team met us, arranged to collect our bags, shuttled us to the pier where we waited for a speedboat to take us to the hotel. The dock at the hotel is picture perfect and you are whisked away to the reception area, where you are personally greeted and your room is assigned and the resort amenities are explained to you and then you are escorted to your room. We chose a room overlooking the water, the view and the sound of the ocean made it well worth the added expense. The breakfast each morning, is very good with may choices and they even have a special section just for kids, it tempted me more than once. If you want to relax and and be a bit secluded from the more active areas this hotel is for you. The hotel also provides a free shuttle to the beach areas so you can explore there as well. Actual Stay was December 2013, but I just started to contribute reviews.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

The staff are so courteous and helpful.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at ""The Shang"" Boracay.

From the moment we landed, staff whisked us away to their dedicated lounge awaiting the boat transfer.

I am glad we stayed away from town, Boracay town is REALLY busy, not really our thing.

Room is very well appointed, and the Shang does their ""textured"" room walls as their trademark.

Staff is very friendly and efficient. The thing I enjoyed seeing is that the locals are in management positions and not, as per other international resorts, with the typical foreigner running around giving orders.

Being a Jade level member gave us to extra 15 mins foot reflexology, a bonus as we love our spa treatments.

Breakfast is very good but short of Shang Singapore (if you have tasted Shang Sing's brekky, you will probably agree that it is simply exceptional for variety and quality... So perhaps not a fair comparison). Seriously, lunch is optional after a big brekky and dinner is reasonably priced vs. australian standards as The Shang can't afford to gouge when there are a plethora of restaurants in town (15 mins ride away due to traffic).

We didn't do too much activities but I have to say if you're a scuba diver, then the Shangs pricing is a bit ludicrous. Nearly 3 times the cost of the dive centres in town.... I dived using other operators in town.

Whilst we prefer smaller boutique hotels, The Shang Boracay didn't disappoint.",Food:Location:Value for money
"if you are in Boracay , even if you don't stay in shangri-la , is highly recommended to go there to see the sunset . the solana bar is in a strategic position to admire the sunset and enjoy all the laguna's view .there are private terraces where you can stay to drink .. that create a unique , private and relaxing atmosphere ! the staff is great , super friendly and professional at the same time!

Boracay is a very beautiful setting but the main beach is way too crowded for my taste with lots of hawkers. The Shangri La is a short drive away from there but allows you to get away from that craziness to a private and elegant tropical paradise. The setting at the pool is just fantastic! There is really no need to even leave the property. The gym is very large. Strong wifi throughout most of the property. The spa was wonderful and they were very accommodating at the restaurants. The green custard-filled buns at breakfast were particularly deliciious local specialties. Would definitely go back here if my travels take me back to the Philippines,Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"A beautiful resort, fantastic location, charming and helpful staff. Restaurants marginally let it down although breakfast can't be beaten. Pools are great, and beach is stunning. We came here from the Shangri-la in Cebu and you couldn't believe they are the same chain. This is a great hotel for couples whilst the Cebu one was more like a holiday camp for young kids.",Food:Staff:Location
"This was a vacation that I'll never forget. Had the most amazing time. Pools were amazing. Our balcony overlooked the beach and ocean. Helped that we were on the top corner room for extra privacy. We were celebrating our anniversary and the hotel gave us a complimentary bottle of wine AND presented us with an anniversary cake during dinner one night. It was so sweet of them but the restaurant already gave us a complimentary dessert so they sent the cake to our room to enjoy later. What made this trip extra special was the upgrade to a spa villa for a couples massage. We surely lucked out. We got to swim and have tea in our own spa villa for the whole afternoon. Massages were pretty good but pricey.

So sad to see all the recent reviews being quite low. I'd still go back in a heartbeat.",Staff:Food
"We stayed in this hotel over the New Year 2015. The stand-out point is the customary Filipino friendliness and seemingly endless service with a smile. The staff were extremely attentive and helpful. However the property itself seems quite dated and tired for what is a fairly new hotel. My main disappointment was the quality of the food which was, in my opinion, well below what I would expect from a 5 star rated facility. It was often bland and sometimes verging on unedible, and represented poor value for the cost of our stay. It's not a place I would return to.",Staff:Value for money:Food
"I've stayed at Shangri-La Hotels all over Asia and this one ranks right at the top. Easily one of the top 3 hotels I've ever stayed in, anywhere. From the ""welcome to paradise"" greeting to every last detail it's impossible to find fault with this slice of heaven. The only problem? Leaving too soon!",
"First time in Boracay and stayed here for a cousins weeding. They picked us up at the airport, pampered us before we got loaded on the speedboat, cart us to reception, and our rooms was excellent. Beach(s) was spectacular, infinity pool, restaurant/room service was great. Just a place that has everything. Rate was good but it was wedding rate, not sure if regular is a lot higher.

Top Hotel/Resort in the island for sure. A typical Shangri-la standard.",Staff:Food
"I was in many Shangri-La hotels, but in Boracay the food is the worst. Lack of exelence not only in breakfast but also in a la carte restaurants. Fish restaurant was terrible qualuty. there were no fresh shrimps, but little bit old. such quality is not acceptable.The breakfast buffet aslo is poor. and not tasty. After a Christmas celebration party in Balroom I had serious problems with stomac. Last week We were in Shangri La In Makati and the food was exelent everywerein bufet and in all a la carte restaurants. Although the staff is very very polite and helpfull.",Food
Stayed there five nights Close to perfection but shower and toilet cabins are pathetic. Do not fit to the glamorous style. Doors don't close. Rented out 4 rooms. Little far away from city center.

"It is expensive, but that is relative, because your memories will keep a lot of unforgettable experiences, vies, colours, and nice details.
The vilas are fantastic, apart the air conditioner that needs an upgrade, as it is quite noisy.
Services al along the property are high standard and the personnel will always make the outmost to make you happy..",Location:Value for money
"I would caveat that the perfect resort does not exist and there is always a trade off. At Shang Boracay the setting is outstanding, service intention the best (execution slips at times), rooms lovely, innovative touches (like 24 hour spa and champagne at breakfast) and clearly a fantastic team - both management and service staff.

Food taste is an issue - so keep expectations low and this is the price to pay for a perfect holiday (thats atleast how i look at it).

Another issue is the connection - PAL canceled, then reinstated with 2 hour delay leaving us stressed out on holiday. I think smarter to come in lower season and/or use Kalibo airport vs Caticlan if one flying in from region.

Non the less the beach at Shang Boracay - the part on the bay where the speedboats leave is among the best in the world - clean, turquoise water, a double bay, gentle waves, fine light sand (between white and brown)

The Shangri La Boracay is an outstanding resort:fine views of white sands and the sea, refined architecture, impeccable service throughout, sumptuous breakfasts. There is lots of activities for everyone to do, from taichi classes to helmet diving. There is also a great entertainment hub in the main building.
One word of caution: the location is somewhat secluded, so it's not so convenient commuting to downtown, with it's lively party scene",Location:Food
Great place! can't go wrong! a bit more expensive then other places in Boracay but the service and atmosphere more than make up for it! The rooms were very nice with a great view. The staff was very attentive and helpful. The boat service to and from the hotel on arrival and departure made the transition from the airport to the hotel painless. The pool and bars were very nice as well and the sunsets spectacular! They also have a free shuttle that will take you to the white beach. If you want a guaranteed nice stay this is the place to go.,Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"We booked 3 days at this hotel before our parents joined us to Boracay and will not regret we made that decision, we had a very nice stay.

The property is huge, and is on one of the nicer beaches you will find on this island. This is a private beach and it was not crowded at all. For families that travel with children, there is a huge adventure center with slides where kids will have lots of fun, this is a huge plus.
In our opinion it was the staff that made our stay good as it was, not the facilities. Very friendly and engaged but not annoying.
In terms of price for money, our opinion is that this hotel in particular is running a ""monopoly"" as it is the only 5 star hotel on the island and if you are accustomed to this type of travel you have to book here. The cheapest room is quite high. The hotel built in 2009, already showing a lot of signs of age. This is not our first stay in Shangri-La, and i am beginning to think that it is simply because cheap materials are used. Ceiling showing lots of cracks and damage from the central AC units, the wood work is already started deteriorating from the humidity, etc.
The breakfast was ok, some variety but nothing special. I usually try the room service hamburger, and if i am to compare to any other 5 star hotel i have stayed in this was the lowest so far. My wife liked her meal so it could be that it was just a bad day.
The sea food restaurant and bar were very nice, ill rate those separately.

On overall, i would recommend this hotel for a family stay to anyone, to us the convenience of shuttle transport to the center of the island and friendly staff were really important as it is difficult to get around in Boracay with a 13month old, but if another 5 star facility opens up this group will have a big issue.

"Well after the whole days journey for a plane trip of 50 mins due to the strange 'service' ethics of PAL Philippines Airline -warning Dio not fly with PAL we arrived to attend a private function of pre wedding barbecue on beach which was splendid. Our room a treetop villa was very spacious but a little shabby here and there for a 5 star hotel the roof leaked a little and the toilet got blocked due to water pump problems. The garden wedding we attended as guests was beautiful and the food at the cocktails followed by dinner was excellent. However food at the seafood restaurant a previous night was average to poor and another restaurant we attended was awful (the Pavilion?). On the Saturday it rained down so we resorted to this restaurant as a table of 9 of us. The service was poor the young waiter it was obvious was untrained flustered and we ended up pouring our own wine. The laksa was small and uninteresting compared to the laksa I order in a Perth Asian restaurant regularly twice the price and no where near the quantity.
Service standards - yes there are a lot of staff always ready to serve you but they were usually poorly trained. There is No 'service of alcohol ' here - staff were pushing shots and spirits at obvious drunk people. This I think is because they want to be tipped? We usually tipped 50 - 100 pesos to the buggy drivers and wait staff this may sound a lot but 100 pesos is less than AU$2.00. Staff earned about the equivalent of $1 an hour which is probably normal in the Philippines but still makes me feel uncomfortable that it is so low.
We returned to Manila via PAL again took a whole day due to cancellations and delays and confusion. Thanks to Alan from Shangrila-la he helped us a lot. Conclusion the wedding was wonderful the resort nice enough but to make the huge effort to get there - and to feel that the high level of attention from staff was due to the desperation to be tipped ( note lack of training equals poor service no matter the level of attention to the guest) does not make it worth while to return.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"My description of Shangri-La Boracay's service is exceptional end to end care. My family and I had to deal with the inefficiencies of PAL (a different story altogether) but the service of the Shangri-La Boracay staff saved our vacation. Their airport staff both in Caticlan and Kalibo made sure we were properly checked in and informed of flight developments. At the resort itself, I could not ask for better service. Checking in was a breeze, very attentive and efficient. I also ended up working out at the gym everyday I was there because of the nice little touches - cold towel, freshly brewed tea, bottled water (on top of the great facilities, of course). Room service was quick and efficient. And the staff at Chi Spa were awesome, those people know how to spoil their guests. Really, all our touchpoints with the resort and the staff were all excellent.

"I love this place. Last week was my 6th visit with my family to the Shangri-La Resort in Boracay. The experience is 2nd to none and we always have an amazing time. I have two kids (7 and 9 years) and the staff in the Adventure Zone and Entertainment Center were amazing. We also love that we have Beng as a babysitter for each of our visits. The continuity over the last 4 years with Beng has been spectacular. There were a few disappointments and changes that we saw this year in F&B, Room Quality and Maintenance that I believe the hotel is working. When talking to the F&B lead they are working on a new dinner concept that was not rolled out as yet. My family really enjoyed the dinner buffet that was not available at all during our stay. The room was a bit in disrepair for 5 star standards with broken and squeaky doors, loose hooks, and loose faucets, but these issues were immediately attended to by maintenance once they were identified. My normal room type (two beds) was not provided even after request. This was a minor setback however, when I went to move my luggage to my new room, there was already a guest in the existing room! This was a big lapse by the front desk allowing me to go back to a room that was occupied. Imagine the surprise of this unsuspecting guest when I walked in on her!

Given my 6th visit I can only assume that something changed in front desk staff and preventative maintenance staff. However, management assured me that these issues were one offs.

For anyone reading this and deciding on whether to go here. GO!! There is no other place in Boracay like the Shang. Also, try the beach front BBQ special dinner. Truly a reward winning experience.

I will certainly go to this property again - the people are awesome, the service is generally top notch and I'm sure my issues were unique and won't occur again. I hope they are right!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

2. Should we splash around in our own infinity plunge-pool nestled in the jungle foliage, and soak up some much needed sunshine? OR?

3. Should we stand under the heavenly, private outdoor rain shower in preparation for the: never-ending-variety-breakfast-buffet. OR?

4. Should we saunter down to the gorgeous picture perfect beach and swim in the calm, crystal clear, warm ocean. OR?

5. Should we go a few steps further and enjoy the lively atmosphere at the private beach with soft fine sand under our feet. We could perhaps grab a bite at the conveniently located snack bar. OR?

7. Should we do laps in the Olympic sized outdoor pool nestled amongst the palm trees. OR?

8. Should we just lay down on the lounge chair in our villa, and do nothing!

The ride was smooth and fast and we reached the Shangrila Port in no time. The place is so nice and so private. Rooms were clean and superb! We had the garden view though. Seaview would be better. Staff are courteous and nice. The pools are great ( and lap pool) and the private beach front is so beautiful! The sands of course are coarser than those in Station 1 & 2 but overall the beach is ok. They have an adjacent beach that is longer and better. You can just walk or ask for a buggy. They have shuttle service every 30 mins to D Mall in Station 2 where you can have grilled food by the beach. Buffet breakfast is also good. It's open up to 11am so you can take a brunch and go to Station 2 for a walk and be back in the hotel for the beautiful sunset! Free Wifi is strong even at the beach area.

"I had a four-night mini vacation with my daughters (10 and 14) and never left the resort. The service was wonderful — Pinoy hospitality and Shangri-la organization. The breakfast buffet has something for everyone and the food is of very high quality. The setting and grounds are picture postcard beautiful. You are paying premium prices, but you get what you pay for.

We loved the hotel. But if you are thinking of staying at here or any hotel in Boracay, carefully consider your transportation options.

Our return to Hong Kong was a nightmare. First Philippine Airlines cancelled our flight and booked us on a flight two hours earlier, leaving us with a five-hour layover at Manila airport (something to be avoided — it's a miserable, poorly run facility).

We arrived at Cataclan airport to find chaos. People were backed up out the door; there were no announcements on the PA system; the flight information displays had no data on them; and there were no queues for passengers trying to check in.

Fifteen minutes after our flight was to have departed, we learned that we would be driven to Calibo airport and put on a flight leaving at 18:00. That would have caused us to miss our connecting flight from Manila to Hong Kong and get home more than 13 hours after leaving the resort.

After a heated discussion, I convinced the Philippines Airlines manager to get us on a flight leaving Calibo at 16;00 (which had several empty seats on it) and we made our connecting flight from Manila to Hong Kong.

I have talked two people who had similar experiences before and after our flight. In short, we will not be back until Boracay is served by a competent carrier.",Staff

"It's amazing how the Shangri-la at Boracay felt like our home away from home.

The journey: A smooth and flawless process, as you are accompanied by friendly hotel staff straight from the airport, into a comfortable vehicle (if you chose to hire one), direct to the Caticlan port lounge where your direct speedboat transfer to the hotel jetty awaits. There are frequent shuttle services into town, so nowhere is out of reach.

The people: The staff are genuinely proud of their hotel and appear happy to work there.

The rooms: As with most luxury hotels, their clean white fresh smelling bed sheets, lavish bathrooms with quality products, and more, make it an easy choice to keep coming back for more. Small details... like a full ice bucket every evening, serving dessert after our mains even when you order room service, and their willingness to personalise your stay, just brings a smile to your face every time.

The place: Beautiful sunsets every evening, make you spoilt for choice as to where to enjoy it from... The room? The pool? The lawn? One of two private beaches? Or any of their amazing outdoor restaurants? Or... A paraw sunset sailboat ride to chase the sun down the horizon as it descends? It's hard to decide.

Firstly, the location of the property is stunning...located on the nicest beach in Boracay with white sand and crystal clear water (think Maldives). We stayed at the Tree House villa which was spectacular...perched on a cliff side, it had sweeping views of the Ocean and the room itself was massive. Bedroom on the bottom floor and living room and balcony on the top floor. However, what really made our stay special was the staff and service.

"We stayed here over the weekend for a double birthday celebration for my son & I.

We were given a deluxe room with garden view on the 4th floor (401). The room was a bit of a walk from the lobby and facilities. My husband & I joked that our walk from the room to the gym was our warm up. The size of the room was more then enough to accommodate our family of 3.

The pool area was impressive. Big, warm & it had the best views of the beach. The private beach was beautiful,peaceful and clean. It was the perfect spot to watch Boracay's famous sunset while drinking some cocktails.

Food was a bit expensive so there were times we took the shuttle to D' Mall to have our late lunch.

I agree with all the reviewers when they say that Shang Boracay is expensive but I believe that you get your money's worth. The facilities & service is top notch. It's really worth it!

Since Shang is around 20 minutes away from D' Mall - I think this resort is perfect for families & couples who just want to relax and be away from it all. Those who want ""action"", bars & have access to D' Mall should stay in station 1 & 2 instead.

I would like to thank Franchette & the manager (sorry did not get your name) who i spoke to regarding my special birthday request for my son. We were just expecting a mini cake/ cup cake but got 2 big (& delicious!) chocolate cakes - 1 for me & 1 for my son! It was indeed a surprise!

Thanks too to all the staff who took care of us - Clarisse from housekeeping, Kent from the Entertainment Centre, the trainers in the gym & to all those who made our stay extra special. Shangri-la Boracay is a big property but it felt like home.

"Shangri-la Boracay is probably one of the most expensive beach resorts in Boracay. I am not sure if my expectations were just too high or they simply have unsatisfactory service in some areas. Two months before our arrival, I booked a room for my parents as a surprise gift for their 35th wedding anniversary. I had a lot of email exchanges with their Reservations Staff and those were pretty satisfactory, they responded promptly and always in a very professional manner. Since my parents will only stay for a night in the middle of our stay in the island, we had to waive the complimentary speedboat transfers to and from Caticlan and instead arranged for (1) complimentary land transfer from our 1st hotel in White Beach for all of us because we also arranged to have lunch at Cielo and (2) complimentary land transfer from SLBO to our 2nd hotel in Diniwid for our parents.

The email said pick-up will be from our 1st hotel in White Beach but we were informed abt 1.5hrs before pick-up time that the van will just wait at the main road. It was raining heavily that day and I emailed in advance that we will have all our luggage with us so my expectation was their concierge will not only send a driver but another person to pick us up directly from our hotel in White Beach. This was not the case, so we had to carry all our stuff to the main road, thankfully the staff from our 1st hotel also helped us out (with arrangements also from SLBO, according to the reservations staff I spoke with). Nonetheless, that disappointed me already because I was expecting better service than just a driver waiting from the main road, given that we have foregone the speedboat transfers already.

When we arrived for lunch at Cielo, no one bothered to look after us (except the guys who took our luggage) and ensure we got to the restaurant. We used the lift to go down the floor where the health center/salon is, and I am not sure if we just missed it but there are no signs directing us how to get to Cielo. Finally a staff saw us and we asked how to get to Cielo and he directed us to the walkway, but it was raining so heavily, no umbrellas in sight so he suggested we go back to front desk and request for a buggy to take us to Cielo. So we again went back to where we came from, requested for a buggy, there was one parked in the driveway so we got transferred right away but still, we had to walk a few more steps into the restaurant area and because it was raining and we don’t have umbrellas, we all got wet, just to get to Cielo. Again, for a 5-star hotel like Shangri-la, I expected more.

As for the overnight stay of my parents, I can’t say much because it was my folks who spent the night there. We got to see their room and I can say it was pretty nice, the view was spectacular, there was also a bottle of wine in the room which I think is a wedding anniversary gift. Overall, I found the service a little impersonal, but given that it was a very short stay, perhaps it gets better the longer you're there.",Staff:Food
"Skip the resorts at White beach and head straight for the Shangri La boracay resort. It is undoubtedly the best resort on the island.

I went there with my husband for a short honeymoon 2 days after our wedding and it was pure bliss. A bit of a hassle to get to but waking up to the bluest waters and that magnificent view was hard to beat.

The resort was really luxurious, expansive grounds, 2 separate beaches, bar, restaurants, and a really good spa. (I loved my body treatment at Chi spa!)

We booked the treehouse villa and it certainly didn't disappoint. Spread out over two floors, the living area was so huge! We felt it was a little too big for two people actually. First world Problems :) And that jacuzzi tub....we had a bubble bath at sunset and caught the most spectacular sunset EVER. Truly amazing. The treehouse villa is situated along the higher grounds of the resort and the panoramic views of the sea are just breathtaking. We spent a lot of time gazing out into the waters and the surrounding treetops. It was extremely private and romantic. We couldn't get enough of it.

The gym was huge, the spa was wonderful, and i loved the hammocks dotted around the hotel grounds.

I personally think the best food was at the italian restaurant, Rima. Close to the treehouse villa, service was impeccable and the food quality was top notch. We left the restaurant sated and satisfied.

There is a daily shuttle bus that takes you to white beach and the shops. We thought we'd stay in town for dinner but there were too many other tourists and touts. We left after a mere two hours and couldn't wait to get back to the quiet serenity at Shangri-la.

Thanks for a wonderful stay!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangrila did not dissapoint, people, beaches, drinks and scenery where all above par. Food in general needs some upgrading. We will return as the family enjoyed the stay. Plan for time to explore outside of the resort as well, the island has a lot to offer for the kids.",Food:Location
"Boracay Philippines, one of many places our family love and will cherish all the memories, and happiness that we shared together. A huge thank you to Shangri-La's Boracay Resort, who is and has been part of our family that continuously provide the accommodations its exclusivity, and feeling that we are at home away from home.
Our experience from check- in till check out is really a remarkable one. Coming from different counties, (one of my daughters and a friend came from Dubai and we arrived from USA). Traveling to Manila then to Boracay is very stressful, but when we finally stepped-in to the Shangri-La our final destination, it feels like we are really in Paradise, surrounded by trees, white sand beach and good and beautiful people, who provided consistent and excellent service. Shangri-La experience is the best for family, great for businessmen as well as a good venue for conventions.
All of the Resort and business hotels, cater to all guests from different countries, that will make us say... We Shall Return.",Staff:Location
"A perfect place to relax & commune with nature away from the busy, crowded white beach. The place is huge...you can claim a space on your own, hotel staff will always around to assist. They have shuttle to and from d'mall. al fresco dinner at Sirena is so romantic.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We had always been put off traveling to Boracay because of the lack of direct flight (i.e. changing at Manila and then boat from Catcilan). However, the Shangri-La do very well in taking the hassle out of the transfers (at least once you get to Caticlan). The resort itself was lovely and all that we expected from a new Shangri-La (noting the big difference between their new and old properties). It had two beaches, a decent size swimming pool and a good amount of eating venues. The food quality was generally very good (see further below for why not excellent), as was the service. We did have one service issue with waiting a long time and potentially missing an activity - however, the F&B manager (Richard I think) dealt with it excellently, which is all you can ask for. The kids club was great - big space with lots of activities and split between rooms for the slightly younger (slides and toys) and slightly older (air hockey, pool etc). The rooms were also very good - we had a suite, which was plenty big enough for my wife and I and two young kids and also had a jacuzzi on the terrace, which was superb to watch the sunset from. The reason that I gave four stars rather than 5 is that I ended up with a rather unpleasant stomach bug which lasted over a week. The hotel's response was that they had investigated and that they always provide the highest hygiene standards. I don't actually doubt that they do have very high standards - unfortunately these bugs can be picked up from any rogue piece of food regardless of efforts - Noma can attest to that. So to my mind, just one of those things and it wouldn't stop us returning. However, given it was definitely picked up in the hotel (we didn't leave in the time we were there!), I thought they could be a little more apologetic rather than their pure defensive response. We also found four or five pieces of glass on the beach. This may have been washed up (and the staff were apologetic when we reported) but a little disconcerting to find when you have littl'uns running around.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"The Best ever hotel that tourists will enjoy. The hospitality of the people, the serviced is superb. Once you 're there it ' s paradise. Breakfast food the best. I am very proud the way it was set- up. You' re at home when you rented a villa, you have to check it.",Food
"We stayed for 6 nights combining a multi-generational family holiday/attendance at a family wedding held at the resort and part of a couples break at the Shangri-la. We considered staying at Discovery Shores while researching accommodation but decided to stay here instead and we were thrilled with our choice.

We flew in to Caticlan airport and our transfer arranged by Shangri-la made the airport to lounge to boat to resort journey seamless. The only niggle is that despite providing our passport/ID info when we made the reservation, this did not speed up our check-in process which would have been great as we were excited to explore the resort. We booked a Seaview room and were in the area facing the quieter beach (not by the pool) and it was great as it seemed we were the only people from our group of about 30 family and friends in this wing, allowing us some distance and privacy. The Seaview room had a lovely balcony with wonderful view and a large daybed for an afternoon snooze. The bathroom was luxurious and all the amenities were lovely and still fresh.

We were able to sample staying in a villa as family members had two different villas with private pools and a tree-top villa which allowed bigger groups to gather, and for us to retreat to our room as a couple when we needed some space.

Daily breakfast at Vintana was very good and we had several meals at the Italian restaurant (Rima?) as well as poolside. There was also an extensive buffet for the on-site wedding we attended and whilst there was nothing that particularly stood out as far as meals to write home about, the general quality of the food we had at the resort which was all meals but one dinner during a 6 night stay was very good. We used the fitness center which had great facilities and the Wifi was strong and working everywhere - walking between the villas and even while sitting on loungers on the beach. The danger of staying here with so many family and friends around is that you could spend all your time at the resort without venturing out to town. The shuttle was convenient for us and after one evening near D'Mall (Station 2), it was enough for us to sample what Boracay had to offer currently as we had visited previously about 8 yrs prior.

With such a large group of family and friends staying at the resort and a number of afternoons gathered together in the villas, we had excellent service from the butlers who catered to multiple food and drinks orders. One afternoon, the butlers came to set up an impromptu ""cocktails and drinks"" for us as we got ready for the family wedding. It was the best of both worlds - almost like being at home with very attentive service. This did not end until we were dropped off at the airport at the end of our stay and I felt that with the hotel having private transfers, it made for as smooth a departure as arrival.

On our last night we had a lovely and unexpected special turndown service which was a great way to cap off our stay.

There were some small niggles we experienced: with our room, there was foul smell coming from sewers and some noisy A/C issues (both of which facilities handled easily for us without being obtrusive) and with respect to our reservation spanning 6 days and rates changing during the duration, we were asked several times to check out. The latter was annoying given the reservation was clear and it took two discussions plus a visit to the duty manager to sort out not getting kicked out as our room keys failed to work after day 2.

Couples should note that there isn't really a kids-free pool and during our stay the pool area was rather crazy. We enjoyed the deeper pool closest to the beach and used family's private pools in their villas instead so the latter might be a good choice for those wanting some quiet time away from the little ones.

As we normally only stay at Shangri-las in large cities in Asia which in truth have been nothing out of the ordinary, the experience at Shangri-la Boracay was refreshingly different and special (despite the few niggles) and not only does it encourage us to return, it also encourages us to seek out other Shangri-la resorts in the future. It appears that Boracay continues to grow in popularity and we hope that Shangri-la can maintain the quality of the facilities and the service going forward.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We recently celebrated our 15th yr Anniversary here in Shangrila Boracay, from the moment our plane arrived at the airport we were happily greeted by Shangrila Staff, making sure that they checked everything we needed, waiting is a ""no-no"" for them, they let you in the van and your luggages will follow.
Their lounge was just a sneak peak of what we were about to experience. The cool towels and cold lemon drinks were very refreshing.
Upon arrival, a mini-welcome party was waiting for us. The accommodation we chose was the Tree House Villa. It was absolutely stunning, romantic and private. It was very spacious and the interior was well chosen. In our travels, the first thing I would check is the bathroom, and may I say that the bathroom was divine, his and hers sink, rain shower, bath tub overlooking an astonishing view.
However, we were surprised to see a small cockroach just beside the lounging chair in our room, we immediately reported it, since my husband has a thing for cleanliness, it was an outmost importance especially in a high end hotel and resort. During the day, it rained in the morning and the usual wear and tear of ceiling, well it had a few drippings of water coming from the glass, good thing our bed was far from it. Again this was reported and they immediately repaired it temporarily. I was hoping we were moved to another Villa.
My last not so good experience, was waiting for our lunch on the first day we arrived. We were tired and hungry from our flight, and we ordered Grilled Pork with Rice and a Teriyaki Chicken Rice, order came after an hour! I was kinda disappointed since I kept following up our food and they said another 20 mins, and so on, but I didnt want that to dampen our stay. However, the food is really expensive, and mostly patterned the taste of foreigners, some of the food were quite bland and not tasty at all. Buffet was the same menu as it was on our first breakfast. We expected more for its value and since it was world class. Fruits were few, and it felt that it was more packaged and limited compared to the buffet breakfast in hotels here in Manila.
Overall the stay was really memorable, all the staff were accommodating and they really took care of you, you will feel like royalties there. Your personal butler, that is simply ""wow"". Thank you Butler Lee for taking care of us and all our needs. If not for you, our stay would not be as perfect.
The swimming pool was really amazing, the tiles were very clean, water filtered and well maintained. The beach was ok, I didn't like the sand, they hand grainy sand with small corals so it was a bit painful to walk on especially if you are used to the powdery sands of Boracay (Stations 1-2 part). Those are all my let downs, other than that, Im hands down to the scenery, location, amenities, and very cheerful and accommodating staff.
We will probably go back there with our kids..",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Our trip started a bit on a awkward note when the room category we had booked (3 months in advance via the Shangri La website) was apparently overbooked. Rather than be notified in advance, we were made aware of this issue upon arrival. ... Definitely other ways that could've been sorted.

We were put in an upgraded Treehouse Suite (the right type of room if you are at the resort for a view) and then moved to a one bedroom villa the following day. Upon our final room, what was not to love? Butler service. Lush grounds. Complete privacy. Free wifi.

It was the work of the front desk staff that saved the trip (thanks especially to Mr. Franz!). While it was a bit of a hassle to move once we had already been settled a night, I can say it was absolutely worth it and I would recommend booking a villa. The staff even alerted us to the fact that our outbound flight was delayed and pushed back our departure from the island.",Staff:Value for money

"Where do I start?

From the moment I touched down at the airport, I was closely chaperoned, The van for the land transfer and speedboat were all on standby ensuring my comfort all the way.

And while there, check in was relatively smooth and the room was clean and spacious. The bathroom had a lovely bathtub as well as rain shower. The bed & pillows was also true to the highest quality making sure I got a good night's sleep.

However, the moment that really make me stand up in awe was during breakfast when I was delivered a surprise dish under the instructions of the F&B Director. It was an Indian dish I was accustomed to but never did I imagine to have it served here. I also had the F&B Director Mr Keith Rajan and the head chef, Mr Hamid come up to me and check on how I found the dish etc. it was truly a lovely gesture. These guys really make you feel you've never left home. I also saw them engaging the other guests in the dining area in the same manner.

I also happened to spend some time in the beach basking in the glory of the sunset as well as some time in the gym which was more than adequately equipped for someone who loves a good workout.

I really can't go on to applaud the staff of this resort enough for they were truly full of smiles and never failed to greet wherever I went in the resort. Not matter how good the resort is, it's never great unless you have a good bunch of staff around, My heartfelt thanks to all the staff and the management for ensuring they are kept happy and motivated with due recognition and rewards.

"One can rate a hotel by its location, the amenities, the service and that something which makes it stand apart. Shangri-La Boracay surpasses itself in every aspect.
Twelve acres of luxury and elegance. One of the best beaches in the world. And a staff who think only of the guests and their well being. Their private lounges in both Caticlan airport and the boat jetty. You ask them a favour, and they make it look it you are doing them a favour in asking. We moved out of the hotel to stay in the happening area. Still we were welcomed back to return by their speed boat and limo to the airport. Our bags were taken care of till the security check at airport. They even helped us to get in an earlier flight.

The beach was amazing all day long and especially later in the afternoon when the tide goes out for snorkeling and happy hour cocktails and sunset.
The only thing the resort needs to improve is the quality of food, I found it very low quality for the price they were charging.

"1st things first, the hotel is very expensive, and it is situated on the other side of the island which seperates you from the white powder sands of boracay.

the rooms are nice and comfortable. the amenities like swimming pools, restaurants, bars, arcade, etc are all top class.

But since its so far form the main beach, its like you are not staying in boracay at all. Its about 30mins tricycle ride from D'Mall

The beach of boracay shangrila, is nice enough but the sand is not that good, and the waves here are a lot stronger.

If you are not an adventurer or the type who likes peace and quiet and just wants to hangout at the 5 stars hotel, I guess this is a hotel for you.

"My Boracay experience in Shangri-la Boracay Hotel

We were there 4days, 3 nights.

PAL emailed us at 9pm, a night before our 2:05pm flight, and did not state the reason why flight was cancelled. Called PAL, they said it was due to operational requirements… to cut it short, our flight got cancelled many times from 2:05pm, to 3:20 to 4:15… stressful.

Shangri-la… Upon arrival from Caticlan airport, Shangri-la's staff were already there assisting us. From the moment we stepped out the van and inside the hotel, we were filled with so much awe and beauty. (and we were only in the lobby-lounge, signing up. LOL)
Everywhere you look is f a n t a s t i c !

Our room is Premiere Family Seaview, 5th floor. We have our own balcony, overlooking the majestic Boracay beach… Shangri-la by the way have their own shoreline. (private & semi-private) Not overcrowded, so its really relaxing! Just the beach and the hotel’s guests.

The employees are tourism itself. (I can name a few: Kia, Rusty, Jes, Roly) & ALL THE MPLOYEES are warmth, mindful, never fails to greet you, and ask how your day was… and this: “you want me to take pictures ma’am?” :)

Buggy rides are available everywhere wherever you want around Shangri-la. From drop-offs, you can just call for a buggy ride to pick you up. Shangri-la Boracay is huge. They occupied the whole mountain.

Don’t have towel? But wanted to swim into one or their pools or the beach? No worries! They will provide you as soon as you step out from swimming! Oh, and it comes with free bottled water!

Daily buffet breakfast is abundant, enormous, delicious, endless... YUM! Name it!
We ate at Rima Italian- fine dining. Their food was sumptuous!
We had room service too!
Everything was awesome!

Our flight was 7:20am, (Monday)
So we have to wake up at 4am. I called the front desk if they could prepare us a simple breakfast AND, surprisingly, this was her answer: ""Yes ma'am, the front desk last night already advised the kitchen to prepare your breakfast due to early check out. Your breakfast is ready at the lobby.""
I said ""Ohhhh... (Pause) So thoughtful!""

I can't rave enough about the staff, they are so friendly, helpful, accommodating and full of smiles!
Each and everyone really went above and beyond to serve us!

It appeared later that some renovations were going on on top of our room and we would hear some furniture moving and some people being rowdy late into the night which we eventually pointed out to customer service. Since we paid for an upgrade, we weren't happy that the upgrade came with this noise, in fact, we were over the moon with our seaview room and only complained 3 days later when it just became more and more annoying. They immediately remedied the situation by moving us to another room and waived our upgrade fee, thanks to the duty manager Joy. She was very understanding of our situation.

We went during ""off season"" so the hotel felt empty until maybe the last day when a tour arrived full of Filipinos and without sounding biased, they basically took over the pool and beach and were very rowdy and loud. That took away the nice calm ambiance a bit.

The other thing that I'd like to mention is that I wish when we checked in they should have informed us of the restaurant 'Rimu"" being under renovation for a specific date and we could have planned our stay better. We never got to eat there so that was really disappointing!

Went with my wife for few days in this property and we wished we stayed longer. The Hotel simply treat you with Royalty. It starts when you arrive in the small airport where they have a huge private lounge (may be bigger than the airport building !) after the welcome drink, the staff accompany you in the private boat directly to the Hotel which is located at the very end of the small beautiful island of Boracay. The hotel provides frequent free shuttle service to the main beach area to enjoy the cord and night life in the island.
The check in process was very smooth and one of the staff joined to show us our tree house villa which we found it very far from the beach, so we request another one right on the beach. Our request was accommodated despite the high season and the Villa was ready within few minutes.

Very spacious and luxurious. It has private pool and Sun bed, seating area, and a very nice landscaping. The location on beach and next to the hotel main pool added to our joy, thought you might need the cart to go the restaurants, the Spa, and the Hotel main lobby if you really want to spoil yourself.

The service:
Outstanding in all measures. Cleanness, responsiveness, assistance in flight booking when we decided to change our flights. The hotel provided a private butler on 24/7 and provided us with private mobile phone to call him directly. This was really nice!

The price:
Obviously on the high side but was very pleased to pay for the service we got.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"The best hotel in boracay but location is far from main beach where everything is at, they have their own private beach but not useable during our stay due to strong waves. If you want privacy and a true 5 star hotel stay here huge rooms and excellent service.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We stayed in villa 14, the room was huge clean and very relaxing, the pool in the villa was also clean, the bathroom was large and clean, the only thing disappointing was the internet connection, which was really bad, even after they tried fixing it, it was ok for 5min then it was back to slow internet to no internet at all.",Cleanliness:Internet:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed in Shangri-La for 4 days and 3 nights. It was truly a great experience. The staff were very pleasant and respectful from the moment we were picked up from the airport. We had the family sea view room. It was very spacious with veranda overlooking the beach. I was so happy to know that we were able to get a 3rd extra bed for free...during this vacation, I have been spending extra money for an extra bed in other hotels, so I was really happy to get it for no charge this time. :) The swimming pool and the private beach was beautiful. I just wished we were able to swim as we planned, but due to typhoon Glenda we were not able too. Glad the resort had other activities going on for the kids and adults. Love the food--- lots of choices from breakfast to dinner. Just love ...love this resort minus the typhoon experience.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We had a romantic get-away to Boracay, despite that it was monsoon season during our stay, we were blessed with sunny clear sky during our two-night stay at this resort.

When we were brought to the Tanawin (loft style) villa, we fell in love right away!!! It's really one of those picture perfect villas that you see in lifestyle & travel magazine, except this is REAL!!!!! We could see the crystal clear water in turquoise blue sea from the balcony and lounging around the infinity pool, with outdoor rain shower, it's a paradise!!!

The villa is more than spacious enough to accommodate both of us, we walk to the bedroom straight from the entrance; while the common room, pantry and inifinity pool are located at the lower level access by stairs. The ambiance and deco are warm and inviting, they have hired an ID with impeccable taste and style.

The resort is HUGE, so buggy is really the only way to go around. There are free shutter van that take resort guests to and fro the town, which is a big PLUS!!! That also shows the tight security of the resort to ensure utmost safety of the guests.

We also dined in the Italian restaurant, Rima and the food was superb! Really a world class eatery of its own, it doesn't hurt that it's located on the tree top with incredible sea view.

Of all the resorts we have been to, this is really the one that we benchmark against others.

The only reason I knocked one rating off because we found a strand of blonde hair in the private pool and both of us have dark brown hair, so they definitely don't belong to us!!!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"It's not the most convenient place to get to: arrive in Caticlan -> 5 min shuttle to Shangri-la jetty -> welcome drinks at the jetty -> catch boat to Boracay Island (20 mins depending on the weather) -> shuttle bus to hotel (20 mins). However, once there it is very relaxing and a lovely atmosphere. The staff are very friendly, courteous and welcoming - not just the reception staff but everyone from the gardeners to the pool attendants and room staff and cleaners EVERYONE is friendly and greet you with a smile.

The rooms are top quality and have a great view over the grounds towards the sea, furnished with high quality furniture and fittings including the famous Shangri-la required washing line in the bathroom!

Free wifi - as with all Shangri-las - as well as a good selection of local and international TV channels (just in case you get bored of the beautiful beaches and lovely pool :-)

The hotel has various eating options and although there isn't an extensive menu the food is very high quality. I can't comment on the breakfast buffet because I didn't have it this time round. The room service menu seemed to be the same as the main restaurant, but if you fancy some junk food then the lounge bar area in the entertainment area also has some great food on offer such as fries, burgers, sandwiches and pizza - all very good quality and great tasting generous portions.

Regarding the entertainment centre - it's great especially if you have children. There is the Adventure zone with the usual slides and climbing areas, but also a games room containing computers, pool tables, fussball, books, ping pong, air hockey, and a basketball game. Well worth checking out if the rain turns for the worst or if the kids are bored of the beach. There are also daily activities organised for children such as hair braiding and fish feeding.

The resort is quite large (but still walkable) and if you are feeling lazy you can go to one of the many cart stops and call for a complimentary golf cart to whiz you from A to B. Lots of fun as well.

There are two beaches, the larger one being slightly more open to the elements and so less popular if the wind is strong. The pool is nice but not warm. There is a small jacuzzi section that pumps warm water but in general the temperature is cool but tolerable (takes a minute or so).

There is a nice well equipped gymnasium with the standard machines for whole body workout as well as a smiths machine and free weights including a decent rack of dumbbells and the usual cardio machines includes elliptical walkers, treadmills and a stair climber. Most people will be happy with the selection. Of course there is also complimentary water and fruit by the entrance.

I do have some niggles, but they are minor: the rooms seem to take a long time to clean. When we first arrived our room took nearly 4 hours to get ready despite the fact that our arrival must have been anticipated. Also, the daily room cleaning seemed to drag on - and I don't think we are necessarily overly messy people...;-)

If you want to get off the resort there is an hourly shuttle service to a place called D-Mall. Just a row of local shops. But if you need a transfer to anywhere else the cost of taking you out is truly exhorbitant - 2000 pesos for a one way trip!! It really limits your mobility if you fancy a bit of exploration. Also I found the prices for scuba diving at Scotty's to be almost triple the standard price found in town, so you may want to shop around if you are intending to do some scuba.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Highly recommend a stay in Shangri-La when visiting Boracay. The resort is amazing with a private beach area and water activities and the best part is the shuttle service every hour from\to station 2, which is the most famous white sand beach and D'mall market. The shuttle takes about 15 min and is great because you get to visit the public beach and the local restaurants and live music bars then go back to your peaceful and luxuries resort. Also, must check out the CHI Spa for a perfect relaxing experience ",Location:Food
"We stayed at the Shangri-La in May and it was definitely one of the best hotels that we have stayed in so far. When we first arrived at Kalibo, we were greeted by friendly staff. We were then driven for nearly 1.5 hours to the jetty at Caticlan where we would board a speedboat to our hotel. When we arrived at Shangri-la, the sight of the hotel was spectacular. The beach was amazing and the sand was soft. The staff who greeted us was efficient and helpful.

We requested for a sea view room and we did have an amazing view. The room was luxurious, beautiful and clean. The amenities provided were complete.

We stayed for 3 nights. We spent alot of our time on the beach. This resort had a private beach which was a bonus and had the best sun set view. The sand was soft, almost powdery and the waters was aqua-crystal clear. I recommend that you take this opportunity to snorkel as there were some interesting marine life.

The spa village was also a pleasant surprise. Beautiful setting and very tranquil. The massage treatment was worth-it! So relaxing and great masseurs!

Regarding F&B, quality of the food was good. The restaurants had great ambience.

In the whole, our stay at this resort was excellent and unforgettable. It was expensive but was worth it. We visited other hotels in Boracay but Shangri-la is the best on the island. You will not regret splurging on this resort. Beautiful resort, crystal-clear waters, powdery sand and wonderful staff- the right place to stay in Boracay.",Location:Food:Staff
"Hubby and I went for some R&R during the last weekend of July. I paid for a 2N/3D Tree House Villa voucher at one of Shang Boracay's mall blitzes last year and part of the perk was a PHP5000 dining credit for vouchers used during the off-season.

Villa # 32 was our home for two full days and the view was just gorgeous! The bedroom had huge picture windows and the enormous living room upstairs opened to a balcony with an outdoor jacuzzi. You could just relax in the water while taking in THE view.

Service was impeccable as always. Our dining credit allowed us to dine at Rima, the romantic Italian restaurant nestled among the trees. Everyone from the guest relations staff, the security personnel posted in every corner, our butler, our villa attendant and the staff at the restaurants were great!

I only had 48 hours at Shang but it was 48 hours well-spent. Nothing can recharge a tired soul better than listening to the sound of waves splashing on this shore, feeling the sea breeze of on your skin while admiring one of the best views the world has to offer. Serenity at its finest.

See you next year, Shangri-la Boracay!",Food:Staff:Location
"Superior luxury hotels distinguish themselves for offering everything a 5-star hotel does, but extending a higher level of hospitality to their guests. The Shangri-La Boracay, no doubt left that impression on us. Let me tell you why.

I travelled with my family (wife and two kids, 5 and 1 yrs), to spend the last portion of our trip to South East Asia in beautiful Boracay. I researched all luxury hotels in the island and the Shangri-La won hands down. Booked a Seaview room and sent instructions to the hotel that our 10th year anniversary was happening during our stay.

Our Singapore Airlines flight from Singapore to Manila was delayed due to technical difficulties, which made us lose our connection to Boracay. Rebooked on a different flight, now to Kalibo instead of Caticlan, arriving at Kalibo close to midnight. We were exhausted, but as soon as we got to the airport, Gerow, a friendly staff member from Shangri-La was already waiting for us. He helped us book a van to travel the 90 min ride to Caticlan, where we would transfer to a boat to get to the hotel. Arrived at the Shangri-La Caticlan office, where Butch welcomed us with cold towels and drinks, now close to 1 AM, and sent us off on the high-speed boat (with a crew of 4) to the Fairways jettiport. Remember, we were traveling with two (already sleeping) kids, 4 suitcases and strollers, but the Shangri-la Boracay personnel made all of these transfers effortless. It was an impressive operation. After a 5-7 min ride on another van, we arrived at the hotel. We were greeted along the way by front service personnel, who had already prepared everything for us to check-in directly at our room, minimizing time for us to get to rest. From that moment and onwards, Shangri-La's high service standard had been clearly established.

We had booked a Seaview room with 2 double beds. The rooms are very well appointed. If you are a golden circle member you will be greeted with personalized fruit and cookies for the kids, replenished every dat at turndown. The view was indeed amazing, yet partially obstructed by palm trees, given that it was on the 3rd floor. I discussed with the front desk and we were transferred the following day to another room on the 4th floor with an unobstructed view.

That very same night, the beginnings of typhoon Negouri were brewing up in the Philippines and we had terrible weather. A tremendous amount of rain fell that night, which flooded the balcony of the room above us, causing several leaks in our room (a rare occurrence beyond the hotel's control). Here is where superior luxury service comes in. At most hotels, they would have certainly apologized, moved you to a different room, and likely be done. At the Shangri-La Boracay, however, everyone seems wired to exceed expectations and let their Filipino warmth permeate. It's as if every employee had superior service DNA. The service manager on duty that night was very helpful, but I have to commend the Duty Manager of the following day, Mr. Rodney Mike Urbano, whose attentiveness, service oriented focus, and positively calming presence, made all the difference in transforming what was starting to be a nightmare of a trip, into a remarkable and unforgettable vacation for our family. When he apologized for the situation, he already had a detailed report on why the issue had occurred, which clearly indicated they had the situation under control. He subsequently asked me for an hour of our time so that he could provide us with various options, and we could choose what would work best for us. Options? Really? I have travelled pretty much all over the world and even in most high-end hotels, the pre-determined service policy is usually applied. A personalized service plan that considers the guest's preferences given any specific situation is the hallmark of superior luxury service.

In the end, we were upgraded to a Treetop Villa for the rest of our stay. Treetop Villas are spacious, duplex rooms with a bedroom on the first floor and a living and entertainment room, including a spa facing the ocean, in the upper floor. Villas are located higher up in the mountain, so they have amazing views of that stretch of the Sulu sea.

Staying at the Villas means you also have a butler service. We were fortunate to have our daytime butler, Jess. A wonderful man who made our stay in Boracay simply memorable. No small detail escaped Jess, from organizing our room and helping us with dinner plans, to spoiling our kids with small treats every single day. He already knew of our anniversary, of course, and made sure that day was amazing, spreading our bed with rose petals during turndown, writing happy anniversary messages as if they were coming from our kids, and surprising us with a delicious chocolate mousse cake. Thoughtful. Kind. Contagious happiness. This is how we remember Jess.

Only one thing distinguishes great hotels from amazing hotels: People. At the Shangri-La Boracay Resort & Spa, people, from Rodney M. Urbano, to Lara, Irish and beautiful Karlina at the front desk, to wonderful Rojun at the D-Mall vans, to Rome at the beach, to Vince our almost perennial buggy driver, to Gerow our gracious airport liaison, to our butler Jess, are genuinely happy, friendly and kind exemplars of the Filipino smile and hospitality.

So now you see. Most hotels stop at providing luxurious service, which is now becoming quite standard. Other hotels have a clear mindset of making sure they treat you, as a Shangri-La employee told me ""like you would like to be treated if you were an important member of the family"", extending everything they can to make sure your stay with them is nothing but perfect.",Staff
"I've almost always stayed on the main beach of Boracay in the few dozen times that I've been to the island, my stay at Shangri-La was one of the very few exceptions. Having it's own beach, the resort is a 15 to 20 minute van ride from the main beach. It's probably the most beautiful resort on the island. Each ocean-facing room or villa has an amazing view of the sea. I love how the resort was built to accommodate the trees and sloping terrain of the property. The decor is elegantly tropical. The breakfast buffet offer a lot of choices and Rima, its signature restaurant, offers delish Italian fare. Perfect for couple and for those wanting to escape the sometimes noisy and crowded main beach.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at Shangri La for 8 nights in June/July. We had originally reserved 2 rooms through our travel agent as we were told there were no villas available.. When we arrived we were shown our rooms and then a villa that had become available and decided to upgrade for our stay. Beautiful location, high up on the hill overlooking the main beach. Unfortunately, we had a number of problems with this particular villa's air conditioning, hot water system and other amenities. After some back and forwards with our assigned butler, with little success, hotel management swung into action and offered us the Presidential villa, alternative butler and a discount on the nights we had already stayed. We didn't move to Presidential villa, we were happy with our small villa once everything was working again and a new butler, Suzette was assigned to us. Many thanks to Franz & his team who were very responsive and went out of their way to ensure the rest of our stay was trouble free. Thank you Shangri La. I'm now a full circle member and based on your response to our situation will no doubt stay with you again.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"There's no doubt, if you're going to make the effort to get to Boracay then reward yourselves with a stay at the Shangri-la. It's attention to detail, beautiful location, design, pre-emptive and courteous staff, fantastic food and services all make it worth it.
We had a such a lovely 8 night stay and came away feeling that Shangri-la staff really are caring happy people that simply want the best for their guests. So it saddens me to stay the thing that tainted our stay was the room. Admittedly we chose a family room and off season rates to try and save a bit of money but still for $500 a night for the room, I wasn't happy to have floorboards that had lifted, in one section there as a hole that your foot fell through, a large ceiling stain above the bath and exceptionally thin walls it seemed that allowed us to be woken by noisy neighbors at 530am & 10pm most days and a few random 2-3am baths and furniture moves. We also got cigarette smoke through the wall where the bedhead is (I'm not sure of the smoking policy in the room but figured it wasn't allowed). We soldiered on with the disruptions as we had been told the hotel was full but it wasn't great. My suggestion is to maybe ask for a 6th floor room at least there's no one above you and just check that smoking policy.
On the good parts, the Adventure Zone was a huge hit with the kids, we actually had to stop them from going so we could have some family time with them. However parents please be sure to pack socks and long sleeve tops as the main part of the Zone is the slides and without protective wear they won't be allowed on.
The Dive Centre was terrific, Barbara who I was lucky enough to dive with for 2 dives was exceptionally knowledgeable and very safe. An all rounder when it comes to diving. The staff were helpful and co-ordinated and it felt like a good set up.
The Food & Beverage service was OUTSTANDING. Huge compliments to the chefs and wait staff. The buffets we went to were VERY fresh, well stocked, very tasty, creative and accommodating to the children's needs. The only debacle was the morning breakfast buffet where tables are at a premium and you need to sit and wait for one to become available. It took us by surprise but what choice do you have. I was a bit appalled with some guests attitudes, yelling at staff, creating scenes with their ""hungry"" children and generally being pushy. We had three hungry children every morning but they were encouraged to practice some patience. Please people, take a load off.
The private beach and the activities available were also great, we felt a lot more at ease with the huge presence of lifeguards available at the pools and beach. They weren't a decoration either they were actively watching and on guard. This is a fantastic incentive of the hotel and they should be applauded for it.
Advice -the best snorkeling we found was under the jetty.
Chi the Spa.. an impressive entrance, very serene and decorative. The treatment was ok, not outstanding. Maybe it was just the therapist I got but it was uncoordinated and repetitive and the products used were dry, disappointing especially after the facial.
The shuttle service was great, we went to D-Mall several times to get out and about. It's a great option if you're staying here for more than a few days.
As everyone says the scenery is magical, it's breathtaking from all angles and it just invites you to sit with the moment and enjoy the relaxation.
I would recommend people go but just be wary of your room placement.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"Staying at the Shangri-La with family is a true holiday. You get what you pay for (a lot). I can highly recommend the 7 day stay package, with transport and discount on F&B. Plenty action for Kids as well as for parents (even when the sun does not shine)..",Location:Staff:Value for money
