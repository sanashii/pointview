"stayed twice during our 2013 visit to the Philippines. 1st was during our arrival where we stayed in the main wing and 2nd was during christmas day where we stayed in the garden wing. I recommend staying at the garden wing: More private location, better rooms, more room amenities, and a dedicated front desk personnel. Their friendliest and helpful staff, the hotel location, and price value are the reasons why I chose this hotel over all the other hotels in Manila.",Staff:Location
"To celebrate New Year's Day, we decided to have lunch at the HEAT, the Coffee Shop at EDSA Shang Hotel. The buffet was pricey at PHP2600 per person. I started with lobster and shrimps and added SHRIMP SALAD on the side. I am a 70 yr. old Lola and not a big eater. I had some tempura and dimsum. 4 pcs sushi (nothing raw). A little beef and some chicken. Dessert was 2 mini cupcakes. After 4 hours, my stomach started acting up. I had the run 4 times and I vomited 4 times too. I was too weak to check into a hospital so I asked the doctor to do a house call. It was a case of FOOD POISONING. Lesson learned: AVOID THE BUFFET AT THE HEAT COFFEE SHOP OF THE EDSA SHANGRILA HOTEL!",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"It's been 3 years since our last stay with this hotel. The only reason we booked again with them was they had a deal we couldn't resist. For 7k nett, we were given a room accommodation with 2k dining credits and buffet breakfast for 2. And recently, they renovated the pool, slide and added an aqua play facility. We arrived early at the hotel. Though our room was not yet ready, they gave us a pass to allow us to use their pool and spa. The kids had lots of fun. Their lifeguards/pool staff were very attentive to my 3 year old. My 3 year old knows how to swim. While I finished putting sunblock on my son, my 3 year old walked by herself to the aqua play area. I saw the lifeguard followed her with his eyes and made sure she was ok. When the pool staff first saw her playing/jumping into the pool, they approached me within 5 minutes and asked if she knew how to swim. Coming from our room, we will go immediatly to empty lounge chairs. Within 5 minutes, an attendant will hand us our towels and registration form. We were given a room in the Garden Wing. Our kids enjoyed the sofa bed. Turn down service was excellent! Enjoyed the great service! I hope they will have more great staycation deals in the future. :)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I thought I might write a review even though my stay was 3 months ago.

This hotel is what you would expect from a typical 5 star hotel in Asia. Grand lobbys are part and parcel. Nothing ultra luxurious but nothing mediocre either. Rooms are warm and cozy . The most endearing quality in the rooms of this hotel is that nothing stands out. It's like walking into an open house and the room could be anything you want it to be. I would definitely recommend this hotel for a good night's rest.
Breakfast at Heat was satisfactory but not what it used to be. It may seem like it has an impressive selection but it used to be bigger and wider...more grand.

We booked 2 connecting rooms at the garden wing.The Tower wing and the pool was under renovations during my stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I usually come to shang with my family when we get the chance ... like if theres no school , work or whenever we feel like it , so awhile ago , we decided to just go again beforr schook starts on monday... so we had a fast check in, was offered an upgrade and the room was really nice , so at first we were treated well, just as a expected coz i always feel happy and contented everytime we check in here. The problem arose when i asked for an extra set of toiletries and dental kits for my children , they didnt want to give me for we could only get a set each day according to the housekeeper manager named ricky , he even came up to our room , and kind of disrespected my husband with his manners and words , he just denied us our request , so aftrwards aftr calling anf connecting to the front desk , they gave us what we wanted , but it was too late , our day was already spoilt , because of the trouble, the kids werent able to take their bubble bath beforr their swim, and we went to the pool later than planned coz we still had to talk to another manager to express our anger ... for we are a gc member and it was the first time that we had this kind of experience, they tried to make up for it by sending some fruits to our room and a bar of chocolate , which i appreciated , but then it doesnt feel the same anymore , we feel that the standard they have isnt as high as what we used to experience and expect anymore",Staff
"During online check-in, they have warned me through email that the hotel is undergoing renovation and there will be construction noise during my stay. When I arrived, they have upgraded me to a better deluxe room as far away from the noise which made my stay more comfortable. However, I noticed a strong pungent smell coming from the lower floors into our 17th floor and quickly reported this to the service centre. They immediately sent someone and install a dehumidifier to get rid of the toxic smell. Overall stay was very good. You must go to the gym and sauna and Erick and Ray will look after you. My only disappointment at the health club was there was no mini-basketball court to shoot around especially the Filipino loves the sport. Perhaps they will include this and consider during the renovation of the gym area. Erick became my personal trainer during my health visit. He is an asset to the health club team. in the sauna, Ray will ensure that you will not overcooked yourself and was happy to keep an eye on me. Excellent service. I was also very disappointed at the restaurant above - Paparazzi, very poor service, never again and will stick to the HEAT restaurant. Overall stay was quite good and I recommend to ask for assistance and report any issues you encounter as the staff are very attentive and will accommodate your request. You must see Rico at the HEAT for breakfast and try his famous egg omelette. It's a MasterChef.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Edsa Shang was the best, inspite of the full accommodation, requests were taken cared off (room service, housekeeping, etc). Patience is required during check-in but the Hotel Manager saw to it that are needs were met. They also communicated very well and had a pleasant attitude.",Staff
"It was a horrible experience last December 30 that I have to wait for 2hours before my checkin. Majority of the guests that time share the same sentiments. I wasn't really expecting that kind of treatment considering I reserved at the horizon club and was also a GC Gold member which guarantee you express check in and check out.

On the other side, my room was okay. The lounge area is small which I think is overrated. The food at the lounge is fairly okay. Nothing extraordinary. I think you just pay and receive what was deserved.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"As usual, took me a couple of months to read up, evaluate and finally decide on a hotel. This time it is in Manila, Philippines from December 18-20. Many great choices but finally settled for Shangri-la Edsa primarily because of the reviews regarding service, location and breakfast! Although some remarked about the ongoing renovations, an email to them and their quick reply laid my worries aside. So the pluses. Actually, only pluses:
1. They answered my emails- no matter how many I sent - within 12 hours.
2. Check-in. Very quick, efficient, welcoming and friendly. Felt at home right away. Next time I wil see to it to bring mementos for the staff!!!
3. Front desk, doormen, concierge on duty all display same high level service and warm friendliness.
4. Lobby is beautiful. Live lounge music during our after-dinner tea/coffee price of which was surprisingly cheap.
5. Rooms: newly renovated, big, cool, very clean and comfy linens and pillows.
6. Flat screen, wifi, radio and phone, including in the toilet.
7. Toilet and bath: big, good products, clean tub, excellent shower. Plenty of towels and towelettes which still smell new. Hair dryer. Magnifying glass. etc.
8. daily freebies: bottled water, newspaper, fruits etc.
9. Sleep quality. Except in the afternoon (we didnt actualy sleep inspite of the 48-hr travel from Brazil) nights were quiet. So sleeping was no problem.
10. Room service. Quick and discrete.
11. Housekeeping. No complaints. As usual, quick to attend to our needs. My cousin and I asked for extra hair products (both have long tresses) got them no sooner than we hanged the phone up.
12. BREAKFAST - in caps but definitely not because am angry. In caps to emphasize it. It was veeery good! Superb. For us balikbayans the Tapsilog area with local native favorites was truly a big hit. We were even able to order what was not on display like fried bangus!!! There is just no way one can complain about breakfast in Shangri-la. Just ask for it and it shall be given unto you! :) :) :) Check out my pictures later on. Let the images do the speaking. For now I'll say, if you want to treat some people to nice meal. Choose brunch and bring to Shangri-la Edsa.
13. POOL - beautiful area. Surrounded by green. Makes you forget that you are actually right in the middle of the city. Very clever design and landscaping. Was not able to use the pool (with two malls next door, women won't use pools. :) My brother did spend a morning lazing, drinking and swimming. He of course swears that it beats walking through the frenzied throng of mall goers during Christmas season.
Shangrila is so nice that my friends who came over to welcome us spent lots of time picture taking in the hotel lobby, pool area and other snap-and facebook worth corners in and around the property!
Day after tomorrow, it is the turn of my husband and in-laws to arrive in Manila. They will of course stay in Shangri-la Edsa. So, more reviews to come. Let us see if they will have the same review. Right now all I can add is that reservations@shang has been sending me emails confirming their arrival, arranging for pick up, arranging for special rooms considering the long journey of the guests, etc. Impressive service onsite and online. Will certainly be back and will certainly recommend to my friends here and abroad. Thank you Shang for a memorable stay.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This is one of the Philippines most prestigious hotels. The atmosphere suits your dream rest and recreation even though its right at the center of Ortigas business district. Amenities are world-class.

It is also adjacent to 5 malls where you can shop depending on your budget and needs. Many low-key and hole in the wall restaurants are also just 5-10min away if you are the type who travels for food.",Location:Food
I travelled here 5 times in the past year for business and enjoyed my stay at the hotel. I stayed in the garden wing (which I would highly suggest rather than the standard rooms) each time. Also looked at the renovated tower wing rooms which are lovely but have no bath (deal breaker for me). Some things could be better to improve but all in all a good place to stay. Staff are so friendly and helpful and remember your name. Breakfast is great with lots of choice.,Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"The person who received us at reception was nice. But overall, taking into consideration all the staff, a lot can be improved with the way they handle or serve the guests. One example is we had a bad experience with a staff at HEAT. There were a lot of tables available already but we were left to be waited. We were requesting for a seat area but was plainly told that we just had to get what is available. The room service was also a bit slow on our first day. No complimentary water in the room. Had to request for some but it took a while to arrive. By 2pm, our connecting room should have been ready. But found out later that due to miscomunication, they havn't cleaned the room yet. So by 2pm, they had only started cleaning. Also always felt like the bell boy wanting for a tip. Staff at the lounge area was not sure if there are activities lined up for the Christmas Eve when asked. Security was also so obviously monitoring my husband during picture takings. Th staff seems lacking in genuine gestures to make guests feel welcome and happy. Not certainly the way I feel if I stay in 5 star hotel abroad. Sometimes I think it is because we are also Filipinos. This is really a sad reality. Certainly not a 5 star experience when you are in your home country.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I wrote a review 6 months ago and Patrick the general manager usually replies here, which is nice, but would be better if actual improvements are made. Here, I'll make some new observations and won't repeat the ones i made in my earlier review

So, i reluctantly returned here since there was a conference right in the hotel that i had to attend. The ride from the airport took longer than usual (90 instead of 30mins) so some pampering was in order. They do the check-in in the room but they gave me the old room that has not been renovated yet. Would this kind of check-in mean better quality? So i tested it and asked for a copy of wall street journal each morning. She said ok. Because the room was so old, i didn't get the pampering i paid for

The old room still has the deathtrap of a bathtub which i detest very much, no shower stall. The flat screen tv is old with blur images. The phone is not condusive to have business meetings on as there's no speakerphone function

In-room dining delivery and food quality was ok. But when i called to have the table moved out after finishing my food, it took 5 calls and 60 mins before anyone came. It was a pity the contraption was too difficult to manipulate, otherwise i would have rolled it out of the room myself

Breakfast was again something i didn't look forward to as there are simply too many people in the hotel and breakfast area. It feels like a warzone. Or 3 star hotel in china with all 1.4 billion people eating

Oh, and the wall street journal i asked for in the beginning? Never came

I have the same conference next year and i'm seriously considering just not going for the conference anymore",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I've stayed in EDSA Shangrila several times in the past and this brand does not disappoint. From their restaurants, to their business meeting rooms and suites, everything is commendable. We held business meetings, Christmas party, simple interview for our staff in Manila and to simply stay there and everything went smoothly with their reliable staff. There were times that I stayed in one of their condo units in St. Francis towers and I had to use internet, all I did was to cross the bridge to the hotel and use their internet in the lobby (no matter what time of day) and the staff just let me do my job and asked if I were okay (few times I arrived there where they were cleaning carpets etc in wee hours and they would find me a seat so I could work properly).

Excellent breakfast, love the toiletries and the bed.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"My wife and I just had a 5 night stay. We have stayed in the Makati Shangri La twice before. However, this was our first time to try the Edsa.

Its a large resort type hotel with an amazing newly upgraded pool area. The hotel has great security and staff.

I would recommend you go for Horizon Club benefits. However, get a room in the newly renovated Tower Wing, not the Garden Wing.

The Tower Wing rooms are excellent with amazing facilities, bathrooms etc.

Only 2 negative issues.....very busy hotel and surrounding area and Malls very busy. Maybe more so during our stay due to time of year.

Nevertheless, for sure this is a great hotel to stay in. Very impressive, attentive staff and security is very good.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
I stayed for three nights at the Shangrila EDSA. The first two nights the hotel was kind enough to upgrade my room to a suite given there was a conference going on and regular rooms were booked. The suite was good though in the older part of the hotel. The staff were courteous and responsive. The breakfast was excellent with some Indian options thrown in. Definitely a plus point for vegetarian Indians.,Food:Staff
"This is our company's national conference venue for the second year in a row and I never had any regrets why this was the hotel thats been chosen. Location is very accessible to two malls, with a new one that's just recently opened. Breakfast at The Heat is great, with good variety of choices. Restaurant staff there are a bit busy and requesting for coffee or water was a little challenging. Food (meals and snacks) served during our conference was also nice. Hotel is very clean and staff are friendly. Used their pool, its well maintained and if you're bringing your family with small kids, I know they'll enjoy the amenities. There was an on going renovation during our stay, but the noise was well kept to a minimum. Hoping to be back again next year.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
Room was double booked. Staff at first did not even bother to show sincerity in apologizing. They only gave me attention before i checked out the following day which for me is too late. Just because i am not a foreigner. They did not show any importance to me as a client.,Staff
"I've stayed here once before, and remembered it as a first rate hotel. The staff are really friendly, the quality of the food was excellent, and the rooms were clean and very comfortable. This time around it would have been the same but unfortunately they are in the midst of a refurbishment - not having a pool, or the main bar really limited the social areas in the hotel. I'm sure it will be great when done, but definitely restricting it at the minute. If you do go - the Japanese restaurant was very good and worth a try",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I have visited the Philippines many times over the past 10 years, and more recently have always chosen to stay at the EDSA Shangri La. Although the other Shangri La in Manila is larger, the EDSA feels more personal. I have usually stayed in the Horizon Club floors, and the facilities, and staff friendliness make the EDSA feel like a home from home. The outside pool and bar area are extremely comfortable, as are are the variety of in hotel restaurants. I would always go back to the EDSA Shangri La when in Manila.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"We are regular clients of EDSA Shang. Going to Shangrila Plaza which is in close proximity to the hotel is so easy and hazzle-free. An elevator at the Garden Wing connects the hotel to the East wing of Shangrila Plaza. The staff are very friendly and always ready to assist hotel guest. The lobby and the pool are under renovation and we are expecting for a grand and impressive lobby this month. The room service staff are very efficient; they go around twice a day replenishing toiletries, drinking water, coffee, tea and other coffee condiments. Daily newspaper is readily available at the door early in the morning. We heard mass at the St. Francis of Assisi Parish which is a few meters away from the hotel. We passed by the garden wing and the guard at the side gate politely opened the gate for us. HEAT - SUPERB, we enjoyed and loved the food.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We were looking forward to staying in this hotel and spend some time in the pool ... Only to discover that there are major renovations in the property, including the swimming pool! They offered the use of the pool in the near-by condominium though, but it wasn't the same. Anyway, we got the newly-renovated room in the 15th floor - finally, they made the room BRIGHT, with many sockets everywhere for our gadgets. We had a problem with the wifi signal in the room - so they placed a repeater in our room! Great. The breakfast buffet was still good, but the breads and pastries were not as good as we remembered them to be.

The hotel is located in the shopping hub of Manila and is quite a treat staying there since it's surrounded by 2 very large malls.

Hotel is very neatly maintained though it's old but staff compensates with their service and smile. Rooms are neatly appointed and are large enough with all the amenities required.

I Asked her again when the downpayment is required, she replied ""one week before the reserved date."" I paid the downpayment 8 days before the reserved date with O.R. to prove it. I called reservation again 2 days before the event, but was informed by Ms. Chevy of HEAT that there was still no downpayment made for the Fahrenheit Rm. Ms. Chevy told me that she will text me or return my call and even verified my mobile no. But she did not. I called again and was able to talk Ms. Ro Anne who said she will verify my concern & call me, again she did not call. This is very unfair treatment of customers of the Hotel.

"Stayed a week at Shangrila Edsa for business. We ate sometimes in Heat restaurant and found this very good but our company had set up food during our stay and this was not so good but probably not the fault of Shangri la. I had a room on the 5th floor and it was clean but old. TV old crt but they were doing renovation. One thing i misliked was the noise from the renovation after 6pm. Believe this should have stopped around 5pm so when people came back from work or shopping they could relax and not listen to drilling for an hour before dinner. Very annoying. The layout of the hotel is also a bit tricky with very few signs around the lobby and basement. I have always been a fan of Shangri La and have stayed in their resort in Cebu multiple times and always been very satisfied. Believe that Shangri La Edsa is a more business hotel and cater to that in a good way. Location is both good and bad, close to SM, Shangri La Plaza and Robinson but the area is a big construction lot and you have to be careful walking around. Transportation to Makati is easy with taxi but traffic is terrible in the morning and afternoon even into evening so the short distance takes a long time. LRT is just beside the hotel but it is also very cramped.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Stayed here for a few days whilst in Manilla. It's an impressive hotel that is well located close to the business districts and not too far from the airport. Currently in the midst of a refurbishment of the swimming pool area so this was unavailable. Impressive garden area to walk around though.
The hotel is full of staff seemingly 24/7. Service is pretty much excellent throughout and a choice of eating places and restaurants. E's bar was a bit of a strange place, music was dreadful and empty much of the time.
It's close to the main shopping centres of Shangri La plaza (connected by walkway) and the even more impressive SM Mega Mall only a 5 min walk away.
On the whole it's very good if very expensive, but for the army of staff and amenities it's reasonable enough for 5*accommodation.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities

Love the proximity to shopping and restaurants, both sitdown and fast food, and also the availability and choices of restaurants at the hotel itself.

"One night staycation in the Garden Wing. Disappointed with initial welcome, lots of staff around the front door but no-one immediately helping with luggage or guiding us to the right check-in area.

However, on approaching the Wing-specific check-in counter, staff professional and helpful; free upgrade in room to the Spa rooms with Horizon Club membership. Rooms show their age but tastefully appointed with perhaps one of the best bath/shower combinations. Clean and large.

Price of rooms great value given location close to some upmarket shopping and restaurants. Would definitely recommend the Garden Wing to give a staycation rather than business feel.

Buffet breakfast a wide range of local and international cuisine, with a good range of high-quality local dishes, and definitely brings a large crowd.

"My personal preference when staying at the Edsa Shangrila is a Horizon Room on the Garden Wing. I am not fond of crowded places and long lines. Getting a room on the Horizon floors would give you the privilege of having exclusivity and privacy. From checking in to checking out I never had a problem when staying in a Horizon room. At check in you have the option of checking in at the Garden wing's own lobby away from the very busy tower wing's front desk, or you can check in at the reception desk of the Horizon Lounge at the 14th floor. If you abhor crowded breakfasts at the Heat Restaurant in the tower wing, you may opt to have your breakfast at the Horizon Lounge, this lounge is exclusive for guests staying at Horizon Rooms. Though the buffet is not that extensive when it comes to choices, one can only eat so much for breakfast. I am easy to please, if there is bacon I am happy, I am made happier because I get to have my bacon cooked to my liking of crispiness. They do have their own exclusive menu where you can choose from and have it cooked for breakfast if there is nothing for you in buffet selection. They have a wonderful coffee making machine with so many choices of how you want your coffee to be. Same for the number of choices of what type of tea you like. In the afternoons you also have an exclusive complimentary cocktail with unlimited drinks, from bottled water, to the your choose of poison. All these in the exclusive horizon lounge. Service is friendly and very attentive as well. Other privileges would be a complementary shoe shine and pressing of one suit. The rooms may be dated but are still comfortable, clean and well provided -- toiletries are l'occitane products. You don't have a large LCD TV, but this is paired with a decent DVD player and /home theatre system. You may have to pay a bit higher than the regular rooms in the regular floors, but it is worth it for the comfort and the ease. Check out is also a breeze, especially if you avail of the express check out, just review your bill, sign it, leave it with the garden wing front desk, or any guest relations officer or the express check out drop box, and your good to go!

"I have stayed in this hotel only for 1 night (Nov.2-3) and I will never go back. They provided horrible service especially to their fellow Filipino people. It is a beautiful hotel but I am not impressed with the service that the reception and concierge staff has given me provided that this is a so-called 5-star hotel.

1. My sister had booked a room in this hotel and paid for an extra bed but when I arrived with my brother, his wife and 2 kids there was only 1 bed. I was disappointed because we paid for an extra bed and they gave us a sofa bed which was not good enough. I have phoned the reception and requested a room transfer but they said that the hotel was fully-booked (which I did not believe as I studied Tourism Management abroad and knows a lot about hotels and I myself work in a 5-star hotel in the UK). I told them that this is not what I had expected and is not at all impressed and they finally transferred us to another room (and they said initially they are fully booked!).

2. The staff prioritized foreigners which was frustrating and unfair because we paid for our accommodation the same price as they did. Also, some of the staff are waiting to be given tips which was not right because it is the customer's choice if they want to give tips and if they think that staff deserved it.

3. I have asked the concierge to call a taxi cab for me as I have a flight to catch and they did not do it the first time I asked them to, my brother who was with me had to follow up my request. This is not acceptable for a 5 star hotel!

I suggest that you train your staff to do their job or hire new staff!",Staff:Value for money
We spent a few nights at the Shangri-La in October and their service was wonderful as usual. The Tower Wing rooms are beautifully renovated but the initial floor we were given had such a strong paint/varnish smell that we asked to be moved. They were able to accommodate our request right away and the other room & floor was much better although there was still a slight smell. It was a little disappointing to be there during the renovation since the lobby looked quite different and the swimming pool was closed but I'm sure the end result will be worth the disruption. Breakfast at Heat was good and my daughter loved getting her hair done at the hotel salon for a wedding. The salon staff were very attentive and spent a lot of time on her hair. We had a great stay.,Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"Stayed here with my wife on a weekend promo for locals. Initially I wanted to stay in the newly renovated tower wing, but due to ongoing renovation at the tower wing, I decided to go for the Garden wing.The Garden wing has its own check in counter which makes it very convenient for checking in. The rooms are very nice and comfortable. Staff are great and accommodating. They clean and check the room not once but twice a day to make such that everything is up to their excellent standard. That includes the amenities and even drinking water. In terms of location, the hotel is walking distances to the Shangrila Mall thru its walkway connection and the SM Megamall, two of the best mall in the Philippines, where you find the best stores and restaurants. The swimming pool is under renovation at this time, but their SPA is fully operational.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"The EDSA Shang is being spruced up and the new rooms are terrific - the curtains don't let in light, good showers, air conditioning is excellent and the service is top notch. Can't give it five stars though for a few reasons. Pool under construction and work in other parts of the hotel mean construction noise during the day, which is not the end of the world but detracts from the five star experience. One thing they need to look at is some extra security for people walking down the ramp and along the street to Mega Mall (five minutes). We were hassled twice by street kids. I'm a big believer in giving at the charity level, not the street level - but gee it's hard to say no to kids. I am considering bringing my wife and daughters soon - and would not like them to experience the aggressive, in your face tactics being used. (I'm a reasonably sized male so I didn't feel threatened, just horrible for saying no.) A bit if extra security would be good. Yes, I'll be coming back for business.

Obviously the hotel was jampacked by local. This is a good sign, it means they provide excellent service. The room was pleasant and spacious, breakfast and lunch buffet at the Heat had a great variety of choices, excellent attentive service from our waiter. Unfortunately, the pool was crowded and the children were so noisy and rowdy. Overall, they provided excellent service, will go back on less crowded days.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"This is my ""home/office"" away from home. Staff is friendly and efficient. I feel safe and at ease when I stay at this hotel. I have been a loyal guest for the last two years and I have stayed at this hotel three times this year. I travel for work quite a bit domestic and international which gives me opportunities to experience a wide range of hotels. The service I receive at Shangri-La Edsa Manila is always excellent. I have considered the Makati location but for the value and atmosphere, I prefer the Edsa location. There are two malls, Mega Mall and Shangri-La Plaza next door. Just in case you need to get a gift or have dinner nearby without going through terrible Manila traffic the two malls are good options.",Location
"We had a good time staying here for 3 nights. Although the pool is under renovation, the staff at the health club made it easier to transfer to the temporary pool at the other building. My kids had fun swimming and taking the arts classes. Kudos to Archie, Apple and the rest of the health club staff for making this possible.
The food and service was excellent at Heat. One thing I noticed was the staff manning or inside the different buffet ""counters"" would only tend to greet foreign looking guests while ignoring the locals. This happened to me twice. It's also not nice to see the staff chewing while walking around and refilling the empties.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"A 5 star Staycation in Manila. Shangri-La Hotels always have impeccable service that makes us want to return. The EDSA Shangri-La is no different and is perfect for a staycation as it has a resort style pool, is connected directly to the Shangri-La Plaza Mall and the new East Wing. Buffet breakfast at Heat has a wonderful selection of food and room service food is also yummy! We booked a Horizon Club Room which has access to the Horizon Club with the added benefit of all day refreshments and afternoon cocktails, well worth the additional cost.

My room is 615 and the corridor and room smell badly. Probably due to the mouldly carpet. Complain to the house keeping and they only use the air fresher as a quick fix to the problem. Staffs in general look new and inexperienced.,Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"I've stayed here on numerous occasions and have thought that the best thing about this hotel was its neighbour, the SM Megamail. The service here has always been great but the hotel has been showing its age and the rooms were a bit dark and dingy. When I was here a few months ago, I stayed at the Sofitel and on this trip, I considered trying another hotel but didn't have time to look at others. However, on arriving, the very charming and friendly Miss Lui upgraded me to one of their refurbished rooms and what a difference! It had a big curved window and was very light and airy! A very pleasant change!

The bed was very comfortable, just how I remember the first time I stayed at a Shangri-La hotel. I used to regard this chain as being the absolute pinnacle of hotels but in the last decade or two, other hotels have sharpened up their act and the Shangri-La's have stood still!

The renovations are continuing but i was out working while all the pneumatic drills were hammering away so that didn't bother me but there was a very strong smell of adhesive in the corridor, which I would surmise, if you're a slow walker, you might be high by the time you reached the lift!

The bathroom was mainly marble and was bright and the plumbing was good!

The cable internet didn't work and despite the best efforts of the staff here,they never got it going. However, the wi-fi was passable but I usually prefer cable internet for the higher speeds.

When I booked on-line, I took as add-ons, the pickup at the airport and brekfasts but when my confirmation came through, was offered breakfasts, pickup and return to the airport and laundry for an extra 2000 PNP a day which was a better deal so I changed to this rate.

One thing I noticed when booking though was all the add-ons such as if you want to check-in earlier, before 2pm, you get charged extra, if you want to stay past midday or 11am, I can't remember which, you had to pay extra and so the list went on....

Now I understand that the hotel needs and wants to make a buck but when I see all these ""Add-ons"", I can't help but get the feeling that somewhere on my stay, I'm going to be gouged! But perhaps that just me and my preference to have everything included and am willing to pay for these but I'm averse to seeing them as ""extras""

The airport pickup was very good with an excellent driver. The Camry came complete with cold towel, chilled water and snacks as well as wi-fi! It was a very pleasant ride in, albeit long with a travel ltime of over two hours but it was much more comfortable in the hotel car than a taxi.

Manila Airport has once again, won the title of the worst airport in Asia and I have to say, that dubious award is well-deserved so it's very pleasant to come out of the so-called terminal and wait for my lift to the hotel in Shangri-La's own waiting room.

Room service was excellent and I'd recommend the banana split for dessert.

There was a fruit bowl which was very welcome but no knife or fork?

So summarising, despite my earlier reticence to return here, I'll be back!

One last thing, bathroom scales would have been nice! This isn't a cheap hotel, and i would have expected these to be supplied.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
Stayed at garden wing suite. Staff without exception very supportive and nice. Very spacious double room but little worn out.

There was an alternative pool a good walk away but the airco sound from the neighboring SL mall was deafening during our swim. For the moment over valued.,Comfort & Facilities
"I reason why I chose Edsa Shangri-la Garden Wing Premier Suite is to have the best of the best service, but this was not so. Upon Arrival, I have informed Ms. On-Training (name on her tag) that I would like to pay everything in advance, meaning, pay absolutely everything till my balance is zero before check-out. Ms. On-Training (the name on her name tag), was unable to process my request, called in another staff, still unable to process, Mr. Duty Manager came in, just apologized and still unable to process advance payment, then Ms. Mitch came in and asked ""how's my stay"", this really ticked-me off. Asking an incoming client his/her stay during check-in is totally ""clueless"". After 40-minutes of the ONLY client checking-in at the front counter, all four of them are standing and unable to process ADVANCE PAYMENT. I suggest everyone should go through Front Desk Computer System Training to solve this process.

Apology can't be accepted if it is via lip-service. You cannot slap someone and apologize. The Duty Manager should be able to provide compensation for giving so much stress to incoming guest(s) id est: complimentary SPA treatment etc.

"The property was undergoing renovations in the garden wing, so if you need to sleep during the day I recommend asking to be in the tower. The service was wonderful, typical of the amazing Filipino people. The only down side is no services or amenities are available from a out 2am until 6am. Many business travelers must work nights because of the time zone difference to the US. Need to have at least a small food option and open the gym.",Comfort & Facilities:Internet

"I stayed for a week in EDSA Shangri-la and it was indeed a great choice. Before the booking, I was skeptical due to few negative posts about the renovation work but I still went ahead with the booking as the other choice of ""Makati Shangri La"" was not available. Two days before my travel, I got an email from the hotel informing about their renovation work in Tower Wing and checking my working office hours (as I was on business). I consider it as a good beginning as they didn't put me into surprise after I check in at the hotel. I replied to the email informing that I will be working in EU time zone and hence would prefer a room that do not disturb my sleep till late in the morning.

When I actually checked in, they offered me a room in Garden Wing (which is already renovated) and hence no disturbance with the renovation work in Tower wing. That was a good gesture and I was happy with that. But I'm not sure whether they will be able to accommodate this type of requests with all the guests especially during the peak period.

What I liked:
- Excellent staff. They go out of the way to give an excellent customer service (Example: After leaving my room, I was walking on the corridor to catch the lift when I saw one of their staff who just came out of the lift. He said ""hello"" to me and then he immediately realizing that I'm coming to catch the lift, he almost ran (around 10 meters) to stop the lift so that I don't have to wait for the next lift). To simply put, they will make you smile throughout your stay.
- Very good location. Shangri La Plaza (Mall) is directly connected to the hotel and SM Mega Mall is just few meters away. Hence, for buying most of my small and simple things, I do not have to depend on a taxi but just walk few meters and that's a lot of convenience.
- Ultra clean and modern rooms (ideally this should have been the first point for a hotel review but knowing Shangri La standards, this is taken for granted :-).
- Excellent food at the ""Heat"" restaurant. The choice is good even for a Vegetarian like me.

What could have been better? (the reason for not giving five stars)
- Due to renovation, they just closed the regular swimming pool which was in the middle of a greenery giving it a resort atmosphere. The hotel is now offering a different temporary swimming pool which is not within the main property but slightly outside. I didn't go to the new pool but the absence of the primary pool was a slight disappointment.
- Absence of toilet shower. However luxurious the toilet is, relying on tissues alone is something not to my liking. I witnessed an auto toilet shower in the Shangri La Kuala Lumpur hotel and I wish they installed a similar type here as well. Or at least a simple hand toiler shower.

Overall, it has been a great stay and I would certainly love to stay again.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

The rooms are nice and luxurious and the shower was just awesome -- very strong and hot and with the most amazing toiletries I kept taking home (and they just kept refilling). The bed was amazing and there were a lot of cable channels to choose from. It's a very easy walk to Shangrila mall which was a good thing because buffet breakfast wasn't part of our rate. Since we were there on business, we didn't have time to enjoy the lunch or dinner buffet at other times.

I was a bit worried when we booked this hotel as it was some distance from the office. But the AVIS desk was great and at no extra cost to our corporate rate. The drivers were very experienced with our route and got us to the office where there was no traffic.

"I have always staied at Oakwood, but I wanted to try Edsa Shangri-La for a change and thinking I would be treated with five star hotel service, but I was wrong.

The personnel are friendly and greeted you nicely, but here is what I found:
1. The rooms were very smelly with harzardous smell.
2. I asked for a transfer from 13th to 16th floor, it took an hour an a half for the bell boy to come up and move the stuff from 1307 to 1601.
3. A call to guest service was always a long wait and had to call back several times as no one pick up the phone.
4. The wi-fi connection in the room on the 16th floor was no connection at all. I reported this several times and had to waited an hour until someone gave me a lan connection. This is very bad for business.
5. At 3.00 am in the morning on the 16th floor, housekeepers were working on the room opposite of 1601, they were talking, laughing and was making noises. I called guest service to report this, at 3.30 am. I had to talk to the housekeepers myself (in my pyjamas).",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Internet

Otherwise this is a comfortable hotel with good gym and spa facilities. The pool is closed for renovation, but there is another next door. I also had a session 'hitting' with a tennis coach, which was very reasonably priced. The Spa is quite special and each therapy room has a shower and a steam room for an all round relaxing experience.
There is a Mall close by for shopping, if you need those vital 'sorry I have been away' gifts to take home. The hotel also have a pick up service from and to the airport, which is not expensive and worth it if you arrive in unsociable hours.

You book this hotel in the anticipation that it delivers on what it promises such as “a tropical garden retreat” or “the nice lobby lounge” etc. and then you arrive and have the big surprise. Lobby lounge is closed. When check in the staff nicely informs you that there might be some noise during the day. This effectively means that from 09:00AM till 05:00PM you can’t even make a phone call from your office because you can’t understand your own word.

"I (along with my 2 other colleagues) stayed in EDSA Shangri-La, Mandaluyong during my 6-day business trip in Manila.

Airport Transfer: It was nice. I have the hotel staff waiting for me and brought me to their waiting area. I would say, the customer service was very good indeed. They were courteous and seemed sincere and happy to be of service. The chauffeur (Isabello) was very gallant looking in his uniform with matching white gloves, cheerful and always ready to assist. There was wifi on the car (as well as on the waiting area). I was on Viber with my daughter and my hubby on the way to hotel. But then this airport transfer service didn't come cheap. The limo airport pickup costs around SGD90.00.

Travel Time: Airport to Hotel should not take more than 30 mins. But it was raining when I arrived and the roads were jammed. So it took about an hour to get there.

Check-in Process: It was a rainy Saturday afternoon. There was a crowd of people checking in. It took a while to check-in. The front desk said he cannot find my reservation, not sure why. Even my reservation confirmation didn't help. After standing for sometime, I decided to go to the wash room to freshen up while waiting. I waited some more after that, before I was finally able to get my key card. By that time, I was really hurting my feet for standing up so long in the lobby. The front desk said he has upgraded my room, which I don't really know for sure was true. Maybe he was saying just that because I waited for almost an hour to check-in.

Room: I got the room on 14th floor, on the tower facing SM Megamall. The room was very nice, spacious, warm, homey and looked exactly same on their website. There was a settee (which I found out later on, was a sofa-bed), LCD and the usual stuff. The bathroom was big, the shower room has this rainshower type of shower head. Toiletries were adequate (soap, shampoo, conditioner, bath gel, toothbrush, sewing kit, hair pony tail, etc). There was hair dryer and a magnifying mirror. And there was an ironing board and iron.

Breakfast: Breakfast was held on the ground floor resto called Heat. Quite a nice large spread of food, there was something for everyone. I loved the Filipino breakfast, tapsilog section. And they have best tasting pancakes, really!

Hotel Transport: We (me and my other 2 colleagues) took the hotel transport to take us to/from our office in Pioneer St, Mandaluyong City every morning. And we had interesting experience. Morning ride was uneventful. But afternoon pick-up was well, unexpected. Once, we were picked up by a car which looked like it was getting ready going home. The front seat was fully occupied by bags and other stuff by the driver. I thought it was an Avis car, but it looked more like personal car by the driver judging for the stuffs that was in the car. Was he not aware that he was picking up 3 people and not just one, I had no idea. Ok, that was the car. The driver, that another story. He practically was shouting on the radio, trading jokes with his fellow drivers. Very rude, very cocky attitude. I relate this to the other drivers who picked us up, and he was indeed cocky, even among his peers. In fairness, the rest of the drivers are ok and the one who took us all to airport on our last day was quiet but courteous.

Room Service: I once ordered room service for dinner. The food was perfect. It was actually good enough for 2 people as the serving portion is large. One hiccup, though. I asked for a glass of ice but they forgotten to bring it. Later, they brought a like a pail of ice. Really! I don't need a bucket, just a glass. Such a waste. But everyone was great and it was a hearty meal for me.

Facilities/Amenities : Wifi was weak and with no password protection. I think they should think twice about Wifi password security. When I complained about the weak wifi, they given me a wifi booster. Pool was closed. There was a typhoon which lasted the whole time I was there and everyday rained heavily. Also, there was on-going renovation so a bit noisy. But I was out most of the day, so it didn't bother me much.

Checkout Process: My boss, who also stayed on the hotel paid for my accommodations. And he was charged twice for the transport service as well as the airport pickup. So the checkout had drag-on.

But if there is one thing memorable about EDSA Shangrila, it was this small gesture of a very cheerful housekeeping staff. Once, around 7-8pm (I was usually late coming in and this was the only time I was in early), a housekeeping staff knocked on door and asked me if I would like her to prepare my bed so I can ready myself to sleep. Wow! I have stayed on many hotels, both on personal and business trips on a few countries. But never once, a housekeeping staff asked me if she can prepare my bed so I can ready myself to sleep.

Overall, most of the staff are courteous and warm especially the staff on the restaurant, housekeeping, room service and concierge. The front desk checkin/checkout staff were ok but not as warm. Must it be the weather?",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Traveled to Manila for business from the US and stayed at the resort 8/17 through 9/7. The renovations on the main tower were going on during this time and were exceptionally loud. At check in we asked to be placed as high as possible to be away from the noise. I was placed on the 13th floor and was not able to drown out the noise with the TV and ear plugs to sleep. Was then moved to the 15th floor with similar results. Requests to move higher up despite the long duration of our stay and the need to sleep during daytime hours as we were working night were not accommodated until our company stepped in and changed the booking to the garden wing.
The rooms in the tower wing were newly renovated and wonderful. I would have loved to stay in that wing just for the rain shower, but the noise was just unbearable. The rooms in the garden wing had a bit of a smell to them even with being a non-smoking floor, and were dated compared to the tower wing. We left the resort for Labor Day weekend for a trip to Boracay and when we returned had new rooms on the Horizon level. These rooms similar to the lower floors of the garden wing, but had the additional access to the Horizon Club which was very nice.
Housekeeping was very accommodating during the first two weeks, but the last week it seemed as if just toiletries and towels were refreshed, but not much actual cleaning occurred. The delivery of fruit also slowed down during this last week.
Overall, it was a good stay for that long of a period of time, but not the best stay I've had. For the duration that we were there, I would have hoped for a bit on the service side. I will say that the laundry service was exceptional, the team in the health club very accommodating and the Horizon Club staff efficient. Service in the other restaurants was a bit off, especially since we often expressed we were dining in advance of heading to work for the the night.

The lasagna ""36"" at the Paparazzi restaurant was heavy, greasy and lacking in taste. The shower head is blocked by limestone, so the water comes out at so high speed through the narrowed holes that it could possible cut granite. Luckily, I arrived in dark, so I could not see all the details of the surrounding, but it pretty much looked like an abandoned factory (with the scaffolding). I do not yet know about the breakfast, but I have little to no hope.
I understand that the hotel is being renovated (I was already promised loud noise by 9am), but this is probably a decade late and they should have started it a decade or so ago. Having been in some hotels in Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta (and Oslo) recently, I can safely say, that this is the worst hotel experience I had in the last few years. So bad, that for the first time I wrote review on TripAdvisor that I use for many years.

"From the smallest detail to the high quality of a 5 stars Hotel EDSA Shangri-la is overall the best hotel in PH.

Is High price but is definitely worth it, they are making remodels to adapt the Hotel to a more modern look, they are updating all the TVs in the rooms to Flat Screen Samsung Smart TV, the hallways have this roman/greek type of look.

The Lobby has Live music every night with great jazz performances and live singers, they also have service for food and beverages right there at the lobby section.

it has a turn-out service which is 5 stars all the way, they will fix your bed and close your curtains before bed time. Nice.

The pool is great and the service at the pool is also great.....it's a little bid cold but it is probably because the temperature outside is around 40°C.

The hotel has the HEAT restaurant which is great...high quality food and service! More than you can expect from a hotel restaurant, It also has the SENJU, Summer Palace and the Paparazzi! 3 GREAT Restaurants at the second Floor! you must try them if you are staying at the hotel!

The Room service food is really cheap but it is great! big portions so be careful when you order not to order too much.....try the Chicken and Pork Adobo is a Philippine dish and signature dish of the hotel as well.......its great!!!",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"This hotel is having renovations and it is absolutely impossible to be in your room during them. Once i complained I was moved to a lovely quiet room, but at this level of hotel I should not have even been in this room to start with. Jackhammers, hammering all sounding like they are in the room with you means you can't even make a phone call let alone relax.
Staff were lovely, service is great, but first and foremost you pay for a room and my room was uninhabitable because of the noise.
I booked through a booking agent, and they should have been made aware this was an issue, and to be frank, my room should not have been bookable.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Husband had a business meeting in the hotel and we decided to join him for his 3 day stay last minute. Called their Sales department a day before the stay and she managed to book us a room at local residents rate and with early check in.

Check in was a breeze, seeing that I had to push a stroller and hold my elder daughter's hand, staff immediately offered to take the stroller from me. This friendly attitude towards the my children was felt throughout our stay. We'd come back to our room with the mini bar refilled with my daughter's preferred brand of fresh milk and a plateful of fruits and on our last night, cookies and lollipops were prepared in addition to these ( to my daughter's delight).

Food was fantastic! Our favorites from the buffet are the frozen yogurt, fried dumplings and fresh vegetable and fruit juices. The lat felt like heaven sent bec I felt the flu coming on and the fresh veggie juices made me feel a whole lot better.

An escalator ride will take you to the Shangri La Plaza where we bought swim wear for our kids and had dinner most nights. There's also a Gymboree on the 4th floor where I'd take the kids if they got tired of staying in the room.

I barely sleep when I'm away from home but I slept through the night during our stay here. It really was a fantastic stay!

"Typically super-friendly Shangri-la staff, with added extra Filipino/a friendliness, but a few complaints this stay, namely:

* Check in time was a painfully slow. It took at least 10 minutes and there were no other guests. Also, the front desk warned me that there was renovation noise in the tower from 9 am until 6pm every day, and when I asked instead for a room in the other tower, the said I would have to pay extra. Seriously? You charge quests extra for peace and quiet?

* price gouging is ridiculous. If I am paying $250 a night for a room, the least you can do is throw in breakfast for free. Charging guests $26 for breakfast is gouging.

* The business centre is a joke. In three visits, I had a problem every time -- printer wouldn't work, network was down, centre was unmanned despite sign saying opening hours were 7-7. Sort it out.",Value for money:Staff:Internet

"I stayed at Shangrila EDSA. I know it's one of the best hotels but did not know how the staff would be or how they would react to my request of opening the gym for my use at 0500 hours. To my liking and surprise, the Reception Desk Staff radioed the Security on duty and asked to open the gym. Just like that!!!
I wished I had gotten the names of the staff but I was so excited each morning I was using the gym that I forgot to jot down their names. I had stayed in various hotels in the Philippines with gyms and they adhere to the 0600 opening! With a tight and hectic schedule, it is important for these hotels to do just that.....cater to guest's request!!!
I would like to thank the Reception and Security Staff for honoring my request each morning (five days)!!! More power to you people and you just proved that ""It's More Fun in the Philippines""",Staff
"Coming to this hotel is like coming back home. Some hotel staff have stayed there for a number of years and this gives a feeling of familiarity every time I check in. The hotel take feedback very seriously and one time I gave a negative feedback on their coffee and the next time I had breakfast at the Heat, the restaurant manager approached me and asked how I like my coffee. The hotel is undergoing some renovations right now but I was never disturbed during my stay. The hotel lobby has this wonderful scent and I really appreciate this. The hotel is connected to a high end shopping mall, Shangri-La Plaza and in front is another huge mall, SM Megamall. There are many restaurants in these two malls. The hotel itself has some nice restaurant and I specially like the Japanese and the Italian ones. The buffet restaurant boasts one of the best selection of food: Filipino, Western, Japanese, Indian, Chinese. It is not Halal. The guy preparing the eggs actually recognizes the regular customers.",Food
"From the time I was picked up from NIAA to the time I sadly left, the service was first rate, and that didn't matter who you were dealing with.

Restaurants, Bar Staff, Reception, Horizon Lounge, Lobby Lounge, E Bar, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Heat, all a great experience, and moods to suit everyone from busy friendly Heat, where people come to celebrate events, to classy quiet Italian, good food, good service, and a great atmosphere.

Rooms are well furnished, and parts of the hotel are going through Aircon upgrades, with disruption kept to a minimum.

Nothing is too difficult for the Team here, even if they are busy, they are pleased to stop what they are doing, and assist you, their focus is you, when you need it, and not when they are ready.

Plenty of shopping nearby from high end department stores Rustans, fashion, sports, jewellery, if you want to be swamped by a huge Mall, then a 2 minute walk will take you along to Mega Mall, and yes the name says it all, then you have Podium (High End) and a little further along, there's Galleria.

Plenty of local and major chain restaurants nearby, so if you're there for business or vacation, plenty to see and do, and the hotel has its own vast swimming pool, waterslide, and next door it has a super spa.

I cant wait to get back there again, even if its just for coffee!!

"I don't think I've ever gotten such a great service as I got in this hotel. Everybody was so nice and helpful!

The hotel is beautiful with a grand entrance. My room was well...roomy with very comfortable beds. I arrived at 4am after a 20 hr. flight - btw...a driver from the hotel picked me up and the service was wonderful...he immediately offered me a bottle of water which I really needed! Anyways, once I arrived at the hotel, I decided to stay up so I could have breakfast. And what a breakfast buffet it was! It had all sorts of different types of cuisines (Indian, Filipino, Japanese, Chinese and lots more), delicious fruits (I ate like a pound of mango every day), eggs in various styles, the usual breakfast meats (bacon, sausage, etc.) cereals, breads, juices. That buffet was great and except for one lunch which I enjoyed in one of the cafeterias in the hotel (it was just OK), I had all my meals there (dinner in the buffet was another extravaganza of foods and flavors.)

I stayed 4 nights and worked US hours (night in Manila) so I didn't get to see much of the area around the hotel, but what I saw wasn't as nice as the hotel. Guards would check every car that came in front of the hotel with dogs (looking for bombs, drugs or weapons, who knows.) Not sure if this standard for every hotel of this type in Manila or if it was just during this time but everybody was official about it. After the initial surprise, I got used to it.

I made time for one of the city tours but it wasn't worthy. Traffic in Manila is horrible so getting to Intramuros took most of the time and we didn't even stay too long. So basically you spend all your time trapped in traffic with the driver pointing out a few buildings here and there. I wished I spent the time at the Spa instead.

The hotel is completely recommended though!",Food:Location
"Piece of Shangrila

The last time I stayed at Edsa Shangrila was in 2005, and going back for a convention indeed stirred good memories and happy ones too. It was all too familiar, since I have stayed and visited since 1992, remembering Harlequin Disco. The checkin was a breeze, the staff was courteous and they greet you everytime unlike before. I would have loved to be billeted in the Garden Wing, and the room I was assigned was the old one destined for renovation. Despite this since I would be in the convention during the working hours of the construction was a fine arrangement with me.So they do need to renovate, as the room should be updated with regards to decor, the old furnishing appeared outdated because of the amount of space it occupies. The corridors could alo be jazzed up with a new coat of paint. The bathroom needs fixing too,but they dont scrimp on the toilettries. I""ve had a very excellent stay despite the "" old room"" and had a restful sleep. The new bridgeways connecting to the malls was also very helpful. I would still highly recommend to my friends to stay at Edsa Shang.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"I just completed a two week stay at Edsa Shangri-La on a business trip, and must say it was a pleasant experience. The hotel is undergoing a renovation, as was explained to me upon check in, and I was given one of the already renovated rooms. The downside to this renovation work is the noise generated. This normally wouldn't be such an issue; however, working nights in Manila in order to match daytime hours in the US requires days for sleeping. Fortunately the staff does a good job at minimizing any disruption, and this was only an issue on two different days. The room itself was quite comfortable, and the blackout drapes worked wonderfully! The bedding is definitely some of the most comfortable I have encountered anywhere. The renovated bathroom had a large walk-in shower with seat and both handheld sprayer and rain shower shower head above with simple controls for each, as well as a bidet-enhanced seat on the commode. Check in and check out were both handled efficiently, and front desk staff were courteous and attentive. Currency exchange (albeit at lower exchange rates) were also offered at check in. General hotel staff (bellman, porters, concierge) were all outstanding, and I don't believe I opened a door, carried a bag, or called an elevator once. US hotels could stand to take a page out of this book!

As for services within the hotel, my review is a tad more mixed. Staff at the food establishments within the hotel offered a mixed bag of service. The woman who seemed to almost single-handedly run the small bakeshop in the lobby was wonderful. She was attentive, polite, and extremely helpful. The attendants at the pool were amazing, even proactively remembering who the members of a group were, and setting up lounge chairs as additional members walked towards the pool area.

The staff at the pool-side lounge / bar, while extremely polite and friendly, seem to have difficulty with the correct preparation of orders. On several occasions (at least 5 during the stay of 14 days) they made glaring mistakes in orders (as an example, serving a ""Hurricane"" that was only orange juice and crushed ice, completely omitting even the alcohol, or a tequila sunrise that ended up being tequila, grenadine and Sprite). This is probably the one area in which the biggest improvement could be made.

The hotel's buffet restaurant, HEAT, had a good selection on the breakfast buffet; however, the staff often seemed disorganized, requiring several reminders for various drink orders (coffees, lattes, etc.). Also, a bit more variety in the actual offerings could be useful. Since I believe room service is also provided through HEAT, I will include it here as well. There could definitely be some improvements in this arena as it relates to accuracy. Steak salad ordered was missing the dressing, and even when asked about this, the server said it was on the salad already (it wasn't and was extremely dry just by sight).

Overall, outside of the few exceptions mentioned, the Edsa Shangri-La was a fantastic experience, and still outshines many of its counterparts in other parts of the world. I would definitely recommend it, and will stay here again on my next trip to Manila.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"An absolute pleasure to be in this hotel. The lobby is breathtaking and the spa experience unique. Its not inexpensive, but well worth it--the spa is truly impressive. My room was in the Garden wing on the fifth floor in front of a yoga studio; extremely peaceful. Beautiful room.

"Edsa is located as an oasis around two bustling malls: one mall linked directly to the hotel with a walkway. The huge hotel had a lot of personalized service which deserves special mention. I am a vegetarian and twice the chefs (at Heat) went out of their way to prepare a vegetarian dish (even suited to the Indian palate). The room was fairly large, very comfortable and stylish, with a modern chair and desk fitted to ergonomics; and lots of storage space. There was even a small stationary supply in the drawers, very impressive detail. The check in and check out was a breeze at the Garden Wing reception area, the other area being very busy. Impressive standards being such a huge hotel. Would recommend.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I stay at the EDSA Shangri-LA twice a year for 2 weeks at a time. The rooms, service and dining have always been fabulous. The gym is great, but it does not always open on time in the morning.

I agree with others about the 2nd cup of coffee....order well before you need or just ask for a large carafe.

Generally, I wish they had a good way to deliver a large carafe of coffee in the morning, every morning at a specified time.

The food is so-so in quality, similar to what other hotels have (like the Makati Shangri-La or The Peninsula etc.), with a smaller spread compared to others.

The staff are lovely, really the kindest anywhere. Food service is slow, ask for your second cup of coffee long before you want it. If you are a long term guest they treat you to socializing events to help meet others. Beautiful pool but again, if you are exhausted, there is no energy to get into it!

"Arranged for a hotel limo pickup from the airport and though it was a Toyota, they provided wifi in the car, which was cool. Reached the hotel in 30min and had the check-in in the hotel room. Passed by the grand lobby and it was typical shangri-la with the lobby bar overlooking a garden and waterfall/fountain. Check-in was ok and I also requested for the limo to the airport upon check-out

The king bed room I requested for ""wasn't available"" and i got the ""newly renovated"" room with twin beds instead. The room was ok, with my required flat screen tv and shower stall. On closer inspection, I found a giant tear/hole in the lounge chair. New room but old chair? The corridor also has the annoying smell of carpenter glue from the renovation. The wifi however was free and available throughout the hotel

Probably had a large tour group at breakfast on the 1st morning and guests actually had to queue up to get in! Not an experience you'd want if it's the shangri-la and you paid 10,000 pesos per night for. The 2nd morning was better but the tea and newspaper I asked for never came. Hmm

The gym front desk was friendly and gave individualized sets of water and towel. The gym itself was ok and the equipment was old. The male trainer on the 1st day was unfriendly and the female ones on the 2nd day were better. The staff in the sauna was also friendlier than the male trainer

The gym had a nice garden design and the staff were friendly

I went to the Japanese restaurant with high expectations as it was the Shang after all. The front desk was not manned and I waited. Stepped into the restaurant and waited. Finally caught someone's attention and got a seat at the sushi counter. The chefs were local and friendly. Had their training locally and found out some of the fish was imported from Japan and the rest local. Ordered a sushi set and was disappointed. The quality was just not there for a premium hotel

The next night i naturally skipped the Japanese and decided on room service. Excited about the laksa noodles as it was listed as a menu special and it's one of my favs. Oops wrong decision again, it turned out to be blah and not authentic tasting

The lobby bar in the evening had a singer with a pianist and it was pleasant , if not mundane

1 morning i called for laundry pickup. 30 mins later and nothing and I called again. Another 30mins later and nothing again . I called for the 3rd time and tell them I was leaving for a meeting and hoped they will take care of it while I'm gone. Luckily they did

Remember the limo I ordered to go to the airport? I didn't take any chances and called concierge the night before to confirm. and guess what, they didn't have my reservation. Double hmm

So overall, there are flashes of brilliance but their missteps far outweigh what they're trying to achieve. The shangri-las in shanghai, Singapore and hongkong are miles ahead and truly represent the brand. I'll be back in November and hopefully my 2nd stay will be better",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"spent three nights at Edsa Shangri-La while travelling to Manila on business in the past week. I was met at the Airport by the Hotel staff and taken to their lounge right outside arrivals area at Terminal 1 and sent off on the Hotel Transfer within 5 minutes. Upon arriving in the hotel, A staff met me at the entrance of the hotel and directly proceeded to the room and all the check-in formalities were conducted in the room itself. The whole process was so efficient that I was actually in the Hotel Room within an hour of landing in Manila.

I was provided with a newly renovated room on the 17th floor. It was extremely comfortable and offered all the necessary amenities for a very comfortable stay. The bathroom was definitely small in size in respect to hotels today. All the staff around the hotel were very accommodating and extremely courteous.

I had breakfast at Heat each morning and also had dinner at Summer Palace. The Buffet Breakfast is what you would expect from a Shang!! Very diverse and catering to a large spread of choices. The Dinner at Summer Palace was extremely good and my business associates and myself totally enjoyed the experience.

The staff are incredibly friendly and will do anything for you.

Rooms are spacious and kept clean, with the aircon working efficiently and the curtains and blackout shade allowing you sleep during the day if working European or US hours (i.e. during the Filipino night-time)

My one and only ""complaint"" as such, is that if I am working European or US hours and taking breakfast in the afternoon, you cannot order anything from the breakfast menu and the lunch menu has nothing on it that you could call breakfast.

"This was my first trip to the Philippines (On Business) and this hotel was recommended to me as a 'must stay' when in Manila and it certainly didn't disappoint.
I arrived at the airport and was met and shown to an awaiting hotel car. First impressions are so important and I thought that they had really hit the mark as I soaked up the air con and free wifi driving in comfort.
When I arrived at the hotel I was a little concerned by the building being constructed next door but my fears soon evaporated as I stepped out of the car and was warmly greeted by one after another of the smartly uniformed hotel staff. Before I knew it my bags had been collected, the door was opened for me and then I was being escorted by one of the check in staff to the reception area. Reception was a breeze and moments later I was in my room with bags arriving shortly after. (Not once during my stay did I hear any construction noise).
Breakfast the following morning was outstanding offering a huge selection in a very nice setting. Next stop was the gym. I'm usually very critical when it comes to hotel gyms as they usually consist of a few treadmills, a cross trainer or two and a couple of multi purpose machines but this gym was something else. It was big and had something for everyone including a great range of free weights. Then there was the service. From the towel and bottled water on arrival to the personal trainers who were so very helpful. Going to the gym just hasn't been the same since I left.
I found the location excellent with two malls just across the road providing great shopping, entertainment and plenty of places to eat. Travelling anywhere in Manila is difficult in the crazy traffic but for me the location was perfect.
The pool area was very nice and again the service was outstanding. I had no sooner walked out the door when I was being shown to a lounger on which towels were being placed and my drink order taken.
The inside of the hotel is very grand with lots of marble, an impressive entrance and wide open hallways. The room and bathroom was great with everything you need. It was clean and the beds very comfortable. To be honest the room wasn't really my style as I prefer modern decor tending toward the minimalist look but at this hotel I didn't really care. I was just happy to be there because the service was so good. Don't get me wrong this is not a complaint. The decor is very nice - just not my style.
As part of the package I had booked I received complimentary airport transfers, breakfast and unlimited laundry and dry cleaning. It was a great deal. The only negative that I could find was that on check out I had been charged for transfers and laundry. It was 5am so I was a little slow but when I pointed it out to the clerk he was very apologetic and removed the charge immediately. I always take time to check my bill on check out as many hotels get it wrong so it wasn't a problem for me. Once sorted I jumped in the hotel car with the packed breakfast they had prepared for me and headed for home looking forward to the day that I could return with my family so that they could experience this exceptional hotel too.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

The kids enjoyed the pool and slide, giving a resort feel to the decidedly urban environment.

Breakfast buffet at HEAT was amazing, as always. If the hotel's restaurants seem too expensive, you can always walk over to the mall (and the adjoining SM Megamall) for affordable and diverse dining choices.

"Stayed here for 4 nights in May when the hotel was at maximum occupancy. Though they were fully booked, the staff was exceptional and always apologetic for the slightly delayed response time with front desk/housekeeping requests.

Housekeeping cleaned my room up to 3 times per day, leaving fresh fruit in my room at least once a day.

The hotel is about a minute walk away from the SM Mega Mall, 10 min taxi ride away from the budget-friendly shopping area Green Hill, and only about 20 min taxi ride to the SM Mall of Asia. When hailing a cab at the hotel, the bellman take down notes of your cab, ie license plate, company name, etc., for security purposes. In Manila, many cabbies take advantage of foreignors and end up screwing with the meter and the rates, but when Shangrila hails the cab for you, cab fares tend to be at their lowest! It feels as though the hotel takes care of you even when you aren't on property.

Each entrance to the hotel is manned by hotel security with help from large black Labrador Retrievers, who sniff out all boxes and luggage that enter the hotel.

The hotel's Italian restaurant Paparazzi had delicious food, but only a couple of the waiters gave off the warm, hospitable aura.

"This is the first time I am rather disappointed in staying at a Shangrila Hotel.
Good: Staff were friendly and courteous. Location is good, right next to 2 big malls.

Bad: Was rather annoyed to be given a room that was noisy and near to the renovation despite request at check-in for a quiet room. The minute we got out of the elevator into the room corridor, there was this overwhelming musty smell. I had to smell musty odour throughout my 3 day stay. First day, there was an air purifier placed at the corridor, then it was gone for the next 2 days. I just don't like to be reminded that I am staying in an old hotel daily. Hotel should invest in air management, making the whole place smell pleasant, not just the lobby.

Room is spacious but old, and surprisingly the bathroom is even older and small. Bathroom faucet not working, can't shower until they fixed it. TV is still old and the amenities provided are not consistent. Only 1 bottle of mineral water, 1 bottle of shower gel, 1 shampoo given although I booked the room for 2 pax. Maybe the hotel is full, but again, I don't like to be reminded that I am not a valued guest at your busy hotel. Don't think the hotel is worth staying in until at least, the renovation is done.",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness:Value for money
"This was my 5th stay in the Philippines and first time at this hotel. When you first walk in the lobby, this place is beautiful and the staff is extremely friendly.. The rooms are very clean and the maid service is exceptional. I generally walk into a hotel with thinking ""what's going to be wrong with this place"". Other than the expensive mini-bar (still cheaper than comparable hotels), I could find nothing wrong. Pool is amazing and the service there is second to none.. Highly recommended.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"A long overdue thank you to Edsa Shangri-la. We stayed here a few weeks ago - security was great, and service, simply impeccable. From the moment we stepped through the doors, the greeters were extremely warm and welcoming, took me straight up to my room to do the check-in right there on an ipad. Room was clean, comfortable and breakfast was such a spread. I think I made 3 rounds the buffet each morning. The connecting malls also made it extremely convenient for some quick shopping and meals. Most importantly, my colleague had a major medical emergency and this being the first time I experience such a thing, I freaked out but the night manager reacted so calmly at 3am, they had an inhouse medical team visit my colleague immediately in her room and within minutes they had their own ambulance take my colleague to the hospital. Their subsequent follow-up was also a very nice touch.",Staff:Cleanliness:Food
"I recently stayed in a Garden Wing room on Level 5 for 8 weeks on a business trip. Whilst I will say that the hotel lobby, pool, gym, and all services cannot be faulted, definitely 5 star, the rooms themselves are getting tired and definitely need a refurb. The Tower Wing is currently undergoing refurbishment, and the results are wonderful- light and bright rooms as opposed to the dark lacquered wood and musty smells that abound in the older rooms.
I found my room noisy. The walls must be pretty thin..I could hear the chap snoring next door, feet running around in the room above me, and the room service staff moving their trolley along the corridor at all hours. Having a room near the lifts also meant that I could hear patrons arriving/departing at all hours. Garden view? No, my room view was of construction on the mall opposite.
Am I fussy? I've stayed in other 5 star hotels and had a much better night's sleep. I loved the pool and the staff, everyone is so genuinely friendly and happy to help in any way- and they remember your name.. My room attendant would leave me flowers and origami-towels, and the room service staff were so friendly. The pool staff are a class of their own- lots of fun and make great cocktails (and you get a free teddy bear!). The breakfast and dinner in HEAT is lovely, lots to choose from. Due to my long stay, I also received complimentary massages at Chi Spa, absolutely wonderful.
I will be going back, for sure, but this time I will ask for a room away from the lifts, and preferably in a pool-view room on a higher floor.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
The last time I was here was 10 years ago for our wedding. The lobby & pool are still the same. The room got better. Got a great deal from a friend for a weekend stay with the first night for full price then the 2nd & 3rd night for 50% off. The breakfast buffet was great. There were a lot of choices. Our son enjoyed the pool while we enjoyed the mall that was just walking distance to the hotel. Can't wait for the new wing to fill up with new stores. Although we were informed that there is renovation going on in our wing the noise was tolerable. The smell however was not. Informed them about it & the next day the paint & chemical smell were gone. I was really impressed with the action taken. We checked in because our house was being fumigated & my mother-in-law is allergic to chemical smell so good thing they did something about it. My son is already asking when we're going back. Hopefully soon. 5 star all the way!,Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"I have been here almost three months now on business. The Shang has been a great home away from home. Everyone here does a great job of meeting your every need without overwhelming you. I stayed in the Garden wing on one of the Horizon Club floors. The housekeeping staff, the pool staff and the Horizon Club staff have all been wonderful. They have made my stay here a flawless experience. My only complaint about the hotel is the service in the restaurants. After a few bad experiences, I learned to find my meals in one of the malls near the hotel.",Staff:Food
"...but doesn't always succeed. The lobby is great and the pool area is a nice oasis (with a 2.85m deep section and a waterslide). Staff are very nice but the sheer number of them stationed throughout the hotel with the primary job of saying hello to you every few seconds gets really irritating (avoiding them is a fun game: try to slip behind them so they don't notice you, or plan a circuitous route through less-populated hallways). And the staff aren't always great when it comes to something substantive, like organising our conference room or bringing drinks in a timely manner.

The room was pretty nice but not all that fancy and had a few problems - the fridge didn't work (took 3 days to fix) and the bath plug was broken (the knob to raise it didn't work but I discovered I could just pull the whole thing out; housekeeping would put it back in so I had to hide it). Also, there's construction on at the moment which didn't really affect me but made the room smell of paint occasionally.

All extras are ludicrously expensive (like $10 to wash a shirt; apparently the spa is good but it's also hideously expensive) but there are 2 large malls across the road with good-value restaurants. The food at the hotel is expensive, but here I'd say that it's worth it (except for the $7 cappuccino, which wasn't) - a whole range of good meals and the breakfast/lunch buffets (included in our conference rate) were the most lavish I've ever seen. I don't think I've ever been to a hotel with food as good as this.

I was going to give it an average rating, since it really doesn't have the polish expected of a 5-star hotel. However, it does have a nice environment and fantastic food, so if you can get it for a good rate (as we did), it's worth a look.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
We celebrated our anniversary here. The hotel's location is great. It's very near Shangrila mall where you can do shopping. Food is great. They also have breakfast buffet.

"I have stayed here several times over the years and always found the service and accommodation to be of high standard. I usually stay in the Horizon Club floor but this time the hotel had some problem with the booking and put me into the standard room. This was fine except at the moment they are renovating the hotel and, being on the 15th floor I was one above the works. Not good! I did not feel they did all they could to get me back into the club floor despite an offer on the second night to move when I had fully emptied my case and was working on meetings etc.
disappointed greatly with the breakfast which, although presenting a huge array of foods, whatever I picked was tepid warm and it took 15 minutes to get hot milk to go with my coffee. Will be sure to go club floor next time.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I spent 10 nights here on a recent business trip, so I had a while to experience many of the services they had to offer. Overall great experience, very clean facilities and friendly staff. The construction didn't bother me, other than crossing the street to the Shangri-La Plaza mall. The included breakfast buffet had excellent variety--sushi, dim sum, curry, crepes, bacon & eggs, as well as local flavor (I will miss the rice cakes and salted egg). Had the dinner buffet once, but a few times I tried they were fully reserved. Room service was reasonable -- and faster than service in the lobby bar. Complimentary shoe shine was appreciated, though the laundry service was pricey compared to the other services (but on a 12 day trip I can't pack everything). Spent a Sunday afternoon at the pool and enjoyed that. Proximity to 2 malls (SM MegaMall and upper-scale Shang Plaza) was a bonus for restaurant choices and shopping. Gym was nice and not crowded, well staffed, and had a steam room and sauna. I also appreciated the free Wi-Fi (wish US hotel chains would pick up on this) and ability to connect my laptop to the TV. Room was nice enough--not large but well laid out with a desk and couch. Also, before I arrived I was offered a limo (Toyota Camry) reservation from the airport at a reasonable rate, so I didn't have to worry about arranging transportation. There is a Shangri-La lounge at the departure area of the Manila airport. Another nice feature was the built-in voltage converter outlet in the bathroom, since my iPhone didn't recognize the one I brought with me.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

We had airport pickup which was quick and professional. Would stay here again, nothing to complain about here.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

We stayed at the Horizon Club 12th floor, superb amenities, nice view, very nice, very attentive and very courteous staff. Check in was a breeze via the 14th floor Horizon Club. Eating breakfast at HEAT is always part of the experience, Swimming Pool was great you can doze off at the lounge chair afterwards, walking distance to church and malls. Thank you for the very nice and enjoyable experience. Just one little thing, the connecting bridge to Shangri-La Mall is very tedious specially for senior citizens and the escalators going down is not working at that time. Still giving my two thumbs up to Edsa Shangri-La, Really it's your money's worth. God Bless Everyone!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"If I would have the chance to stay even for a night with or without my children I would definite stay here. #1 very accommodating and quick check in. #2 super helpful and friendly people-for all at horizon lounge. #3 value your money, they serve like afternoon tea and cocktail(not sure the exact time), with lots of food and drinks you have the choice of coffee/tea/juices. I compare their rate with another 4-5 star hotel , the other hotel rate is a bit cheaper by 500 and you have the access their lounge but they only give free drinks no food unlike with edsa SHANGRILA hotel, it comes with food.
My children always enjoy their stay beside the fact they enjoy the pool/food, they enjoy also the unlimited wi-fi and very friendly staff.

"I recently stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La for four nights on a business trip. I chose it because its location was very central to my meetings.

The hotel is not the newest - the Makati Shangri La certainly seems a lot newer and up-to-date - but it is undergoing refurbishment. This of course brings its own problems (construction noise) but there is little that can be done about it and the hotel did everything they could to pre-warn and inform guests. As stated by the hotel, the noise started at 9am and finished at 6pm - personally it made little difference to me as I was out and about during the day anyway....

The room was spacious and comfortable, the bed was very good and comfy, and the service was impeccable - the staff are just so lovely and cannot do enough for you, they anticipate every wish and they made me feel really special.

The outdoor pool is great - it gives the hotel a ""resort"" feel and is a great place to chill and relax, away from the hustle, bustle and general madness that is Manila and its traffic.

There are several restaurants - I really enjoyed eating in the Italian restaurant and the lobby bar is also very pleasant. The main buffet restaurant - Heat - is huge but still gets so incredibly busy that I found it quite noisy and a bit stressful.

The hotel is hugely popular with families (at least it was during my stay) so there is a lot of noise and people small and large running around. After a long day of business and being on the road, this can get a bit much sometimes. However, the lobby bar and restaurants upstairs are quiter, so there is always the option to get away from the general ""busy-ness"".

I would certainly stay here again.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"The Esda is reasonably priced and comfortable. I've stayed at the Shangri-la in New Delhi several times, and the Esda doesn't quite compare, but the Esda is also around a third of the price, so it probably tracks OK. The rooms seem a bit worn at the edges for the Shangri-La luxury billing, but there's nothing objectable by any stretch. The breakfast is that nice mix of world cuisine, if a bit chaotic/disorganized and loud. The rooms have comfortable beds, reliable high-speed internet, and is reasonably appointed. The gym is great. There are several cardio machines and hasn't been overcrowded, there's a reasonable variety of other equipment as well, and the staff are lovely. I guess they also hold classes there, but there's construction at the moment, so it's suspended. I've heard that the hotel has a ""club"" option for locals and that the weekend population explodes at the weekend as a result making relaxation by the pool far less likely. But since I'm on business, this isn't a huge concern for me.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"When I first arrived in Manila and saw Edsa Shangri-La from the outside, to be honest I was impressed, but all that changed once I got out of the car at the main entrance. As soon as you step onto their doorstep the quality of service is the best I have experienced so far!

It looks run down from the outside but inside it looked magnificent. The rooms were well looked after and spacious, occasionally I would get a door knock from a staff member to see if everything was ok. Room service was very quick and delicious, the breakfast buffet is amazing. I actually left my cosmetics bag in my room and only remembered it 2 days after check out, I returned to the hotel and they had it waiting for me, I could not appreciate more the service they gave me.

The bathroom I must mention as it's the only hotel I have not experienced water running onto the floors, the mirror is heated and there are speakers in the bathroom from the TV.

The only issue I have with this hotel is getting a taxi, I waited about 20 minutes to get a taxi from the hotel. From there on in I just walked over to SM and joined the taxi line.

This hotel is a very busy one, there are people everywhere. Despite being busy the service was great and I never had to wait for an elevator.

The hotel is a short walking distance to SM Mega Mall, it was very convient for shopping and dining. There were also many bars and restaurants nearby.

I would recommend this hotel if budget permits!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"The Edsa is where to stay in Manila. I have stayed there twice and each time was for over a week period. The service is outstanding. Here are a few examples:
- The breakfast is the best I have ever seen, The selections are great.
- Security is very tight and professional. Once I walked around the outside of the building and they followed me by sight to make sure I was safe.
- I was working nights at a call center, so I was placed on a special floor so I was able to sleep during the day.
- The pool staff was extremely helpful with towels, life guards, and food/beverages. Plus the pool is beautiful.
- Check in was simple and easy with new ipads.

The location is great as you have a choice of the Shangri-la mall or the Mega Mall. Both are safe and just across the street.

"I stayed here for 7 days for business and was very impressed with the level of service from the Front Desk and Garden Wing employees. I'm pretty sure my fingers didn't have to touch a button to summon an elevator my entire stay! The room was very spacious and calls to the service desk were answered promptly. The only downside was the service for breakfast at Heat. While the food was excellent, we often waited a great deal of time to receive our drink orders and waiters would never come back to the table to see if you needed anything else. Many mornings we would have to flag someone down, sometimes after we were finished eating our meal, to get our drink order fulfilled. All other meals at the Heat restaurant were excellent and service was not the same as it was at the breakfast buffet. The service at the pool was also excellent - I cannot say enough about how well this hotel treats you.",Staff:Food
"After a year bumming along quite happily, Old Mole has been dragged back to work. A combination of the place, the people, the job and, of course, the dosh has led One to move to Manila for a while and so, inevitably, a preliminary stay in the Shang. Having been in regular contact with the Sales department, I arrived full of the Joys and expecting Great Things. Sadly, however, no-one bothered to mention the major room renovations going on in the Tower Block from 9.00 am to 6.00pm and the fact that, during this time, the noise of drilling, banging, hammering, etc., made all of the accommodation uninhabitable. I was lucky. A decent level Horizon Club card got me a transfer to the Garden Wing (not as posh as Singapore but perfectly serviceable) at no extra charge, but I shudder to think how Poor Souls who were on vacation and wanted some quiet got on!! All of this is due to finish towards the end of the year but beware until then unless you are out at work all day. Apart from that - a typically excellent, efficient, friendly, clean, well run Shangri La and absolutely no complaints at all.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money
This hotel is a nice place to return to after getting stuck in the amazing traffic of Manila. Service always comes with a smile which helps the overall experience greatly.

"I have been all around due to my business travels. I could still say The Edsa Shangri-la is something to look forward to when in the Philippines. Their location is right smack dab in the middle of Pasig. Just perfect if you are going north or south of Manila. During my last stay, I was lucky enough to be checked in the garden wing with a slight upgrade to a suite since, as always, they were fully booked. The room was clean and comfortable and just right for my energetic little kid to run around. Personnel was again as always, commendable and courteous and always ready to lend a helping hand.

Me and my wife was lucky enough to experience the ""Chi Spa"" during our last visit. The experience was no less than exquisite. Simply relaxing and worth every penny you pay for.

Breakfast the next day was a fiesta with all the choices at the Heat restaurant. Honestly due too so much I ate for breakfast, I was not able to eat lunch and skip my dinner!!!

The Edsa Shang is still one of my favorite hotels and I am quite sure you will have a good time spending either a weekend with the family or for business there!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We spent a night at EDSA Shangri-la after the hotel's kiddie Easter event. We took a room at the Tower Wing. At the time of check-in, I didnt know that the said wing was being renovated. The hotel aims to complete the renovation of the said wing by the 4th quarter of 2013. I only found out upon reading a note in the room. Thankfully, there was no renovation work on Easter. I noticed the sound of construction the next day, after coming back from breakfast and a swim. This must have been at 11am or so. I would have appreciated information about it on the website as I did an on-line reservation, at least to make a more informed choice...but since I didn't stay in the room that long, it didnt matter much.

The room itself was a good size for my daughter and myself but would have been quite tight had another adult been around. The bathroom has a tub and basic amenities and is on the small side even for my just the 2 of us.

The Easter event for kids (Return to Oz, 11am-3pm) was well-planned and nicely executed. My 4-year old daughter enjoyed the activities, which included egg and hat/basket decorating, glitter tattoo and face painting, Easter egg hunting, parlour games and a magic show. What I appreciated about the event was that there was enough space and time to do most everything. Lunch was basically kiddie-heaven with mac and cheese, peanut butter sandwich, and sweets galore. I would have appreciated a vegetable dish though, since my daughter (maybe unlike most kids) loves vegetables.

The hotel pool area felt like an oasis! It is well-maintained and big enough to share with other guests.

The staff is helpful and cheery. Service is good enough for a hotel of its size. Translation: the staff is friendly but dont expect too much personalised service.

Since the hotel is located in the heart of a thriving district, it is easy to walk to malls, get a ride, watch a movie. The downside is the traffic if you wish to commute.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The rooms was ok, since im not expecting too much based on my experience in Shangrila KL. But just like Shangrila KL their buffet is superb! Everything was delicious, and there's lot of food. Their waffles is so fluffy and yummy!

The staff are very friendly and akways willing to help. I always decline their help since what Im carrying is not that heavy. But they are always there in case you need anything.

Their pool was great too, I managed to snooze for almost 30mins lying in one of the vacant lounge chairs.",Food:Staff:Location
"Stayed a week for business in March and took a Horizon Deluxe room. Loved that wifi was free all around the hotel and in the room, and there was still a LAN cable that came in handy when I needed to email large files for work. I appreciated the fresh fruit (specifically the bananas and mangos) that got topped up almost every day. Bathroom was a little dated but clean and toiletries are by L’Occitane. Unlike some who have mentioned before, my TV was a flatscreen LCD, and with enough cable channels to have something for everybody. There’s also a DVD player, but I didn’t try it out. The writing desk had a drawer with very quaint stationery in it, old-fashioned glue, ruler and scissors included.

My stay included free laundry services of which I took full advantage once I discovered that they seem to have a magical ability to remove the lingering sweat smell from a couple of my t-shirts. Which reminds me that I need to drop them an email to ask what miraculous washing detergent they used.

Tried both the club lounge breakfast and the breakfast at the ground floor café; both were very good. At the lounge, there was a self-serve section with fruit, cold cuts, salad, juices, cereal and some hot dishes. There was also a menu for cooked-to-order breakfast dishes like eggs benedict, bacon, hashbrowns and pancakes at no extra charge. The breakfast buffet at the main café downstairs was quite large and varied, with a notably generous “bread wall” and some Filipino dishes if you would like to sample the local cuisine.

Was very pleased that there were 2 malls flanking the hotel, which give you more dinner options. Note that SM Mega Mall performs security checks when you enter, and during rush hour the queues can stretch a bit (though they move quite fast). The Shaw Boulevard MRT-3 station is just next to Shangri-La Plaza and useful for zipping into Makati City on a whim. If you’re female, go right to the first carriage of the train as it’s reserved for women. There’s another mall across the road from the Shangri-La Plaza, but it’s rather run down and only filled with people hawking dubious electronic wares and clothes of uncertain origin.

The service here is friendly, welcoming and you’ll always be greeted with a smile.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Right smack at the middle of Metro Manila, EDSA Shangri-la has always been one of our go to places if we want to have some time off from our busy work schedule.

Check-in:
The check-in process is relatively easy, since we called in ahead to reserve a room, it's just a matter of presenting your identification and signing in their ""guest card."" Service starts at the doorway of the hotel where they gladly assisted us with our luggage.

The Room:
We initially took a room at the 15th floor knowing that there are on-going room renovations just below us, after being reassured that there would be minimal noise during our stay. We checked in late in the afternoon and was pleasantly surprised that there was no noise. BUT, it was a different story the following day. I guess ""minimal"" is a relative word, as we thought that the noise of the renovation was very distracting. When we informed front desk about this, they immediately moved us to a higher floor where the noise was reduced to a bearable level.

The room amenities were what we would expect from any 5 star hotel (toiletries, hair dryer, towels, hot iron and an ironing board, a safe, and some bottles of water). What was nice though was the bowl of fruit and a personalized welcome card.

The Pool:
This is one of the things that draws us back. The pool, for us, has that feel that you are staying at a resort far from the city. The place is very quiet and the staff is very attentive and accommodating.

Breakfast:
The included breakfast is top notch, the only downside to it is that there are too many dishes to choose from, all of which is worth the dilemma.

Service:
Overall, the service we experienced was in a class of its own, we could feel the sincerity of the staff to help us.

Can't wait to go back, especially once all the renovation is done.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Having stayed previously at the Makati Shangri La I made multiple stays at EDSA in February and March. I think that EDSA is actually more friendly, the staff far more open and guest-focused, even at 2am. The Tower Wing is undergoing refurbishment and I have to say that the noise is bad during the day. Anyone sleeping past 10am (and like many I was there on work and therefore in a different time zone that necessitated sleeping outside of normal hours ) is definitely going to be disturbed, even if just wanting to use the room to rest during the day. I'm sure it will all be worthwhile when completed but right now I'd go straight to the Garden Wing which us peaceful! I have to say that the hotel were terrific when I explained the situation and moved me without quibble. The Shangri La and SM Malls next door are very handy, and Greenhills only a short car ride away too, so if shoppings your bag this makes it really accessible. The Chinese and Japanese restaurants are top class and worth the expense, and the pool area is lovely, again with the warmth and friendliness of staff being a key point. Sadly while there I did see some guests snapping fingers and not respecting the people who work so hard, which I personally find very sad. Politeness and being friendly, regardless of how wealthy one is (from billionaires to the impoverished) is something we should all find easy. Noise apart this is a great hotel and I look forward to returning later this year.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La during the middle of February for 1 week while on business travels. From the moment I arrived the service was spectacular. We had set up the airport transit through the hotel, which was wonderful (and had wireless!), and then when arrived at the hotel we were greeted by name and escorted to a guest relations table where I was informed that there were no more king bed rooms - however, they would like to put my on the newly renovated 18th (top) floor. I was traveling alone so no complaints from me and I'm glad I didn't - the room very much nicer than the rooms that had not yet been renovated - make sure you ask for the highest possible floor as they are completing the renovation from the top down. I also opted for a package that included breakfast, unlimited laundry, and the airport transit - I think it was an extra $50 a day, but well worth it. The breakfast at Heat on the main floor was AMAZING! Anything and everything you could imagine from all over the world and very very fresh. The laundry was well worth it for me as well, as I was on the first week of a 4 week trip and only brought a limited amount of clothes. Also, the gym was open 24 hours which is very helpful for the jetlagged traveler waking up at 430 and not having to wait around for the gym to open. Additionally, I would highly recommend the Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor - I ate there twice in one week and had some of the best sushi I've had anywhere in the world!

All in all a great choice for the business traveler or anyone. The bed was comfy, shower great, internet strong and personal service from the staff was very impressive.

I hope I get to stay at a hotel this nice again in the future!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"If I was going to look for a fault, it was the little bit of chaos when we tried to book in but that was due partially to the construction and partially to the large surge of arriving clientele. The hotel staff was apologetic, helpful and they arranged for me to sit in their sumptuous lobby and enjoy a tea and cookie while I waited for my room to be prepared. It was very much a standard room but all the amenities were there, plus a nice fruit basket to make up for the delay.

The hotel has people to push the elevator button, to talk with everyone entering and exiting the hotel, etc. All the hostesses in the lobby and the lobby bar are tall, leggy and they show it. This is notable because nobody else at the hotel fits that description.

Food in the lobby bar is very good (hotel prices) and food at the poolside bar is even better since it is tied to the restaurant Heat. Sitting outside in March is special when you're a Canadian :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed there for two nights. Since west wing tower was under construction, the hotel's front clerk recommended to change the room to the club floor with some additional costs, but I rejected it. I booked the room for 7,750 peso (tax/fees are excluded) with breakfast. This time was business trip, so my budget was limited, that's why I rejected to change the room. As the hotel clerk said, the room noise was extreamly so loud that I could not talk on the phone. But, the construction would finish at around 17:00. After the construction, the room became comfortable. Basically, room was so comfortably. Security is also good. Without the room card key, people cannot go up by the elevator. Breakfast.....so nice!! But, I could not eat all of them. The restaurant on the 1st floor has a variety of food, so I think most of guests can enjoy the breakfast. For me, fruits were so nice. They have Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and continental breakfast. Breads were also delicious!!
As I mentioned, this was business trip for me, and I had to host dinner for my business counter part. The restaurants at this hotel assisted my functions good enough.
Just in front of the hotel, there is SM Mega mall, which is just 3 minutes walking from the hotel entrance. The mall was so huge that I had to walk around for a while to look for the good restaurant for dinner. But, there so many options for shopping and eating. I could get anything I want at the super market on the first floor.
Talking back about the hotel, the construction period is limited at the hotel, so I would recommend this hotel for business travelers. Secure, comfortable and enjoyable because of the location close to he SM mega mall.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
The premises are beautiful and staff very helpful - they remembered me when I returned for a second trip 6 months later! And there is not a better breakfast buffet in any city in the world! This is the hotel I always stay at and recommend to anyone traveling to Manila.,Food:Staff
"I was looking forward in staying in this hotel to unwind and have a relaxing day after wedding preps, but i was disappointed due to the noise of construction going on! We were just advised that there will be some noises from 10-18:00 when we are checking in , if we knew this when we are booking the hotel we could have gone to anotherhotel. For the price weve paid its not worth it! We could hear noise from the top ofour room, noise of endless drilling and falling debris! NEVERAGAIN!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I often stayed here because the room is big and very clean. Checking in is such a breeze . Staffs never fail to greet their guest and very willing to assist their guest anytime. Walking distance to malls, such as Shangrila Plaza ans SM Megamall. Breakfast buffet at ""Heat"" is very sumptuous with lots and lots of selection. ""Heat"" is very well known for the buffet. Also tried ""Summer Palace"", a Chinese restaurant which is very good a small size order is good for four people.

Unfortunately we were at the Tower wing where construction is going on. Expect banging and drilling sound from 10am to 6pm. We were given fruits And Complimentary water in our room daily. If you wish a more quiet room, request for a Garden Wing. Resort like Pool is really very relaxing.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Although it's a Shang but the premises are old and some of the Reno seem to be falling apart. With construction work ongoing, its definitely not a place that you choose to stay in if you see yourself spending sometime within the hotel premises. One good thing about it was the hotel is pretty self-sufficient. With a clinic onsite to boost of. Order dine-in services. Food served was really average for the price paid. I don't think I would stay there again if given a choice.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Stayed at the Edsa Shangri La for 5 nights in February. As always the staff at the Shangri La were excellent from the moment you worked in the door, through to reception, housekeeping, wait staff, pool staff, anywhere you went. My main reason for staying here was to have access to a great pool and access to shopping. The pool was great, it was large, well landscaped, plenty of sunlounges and the pool at one end was really deep which was great for a very tall family member who normally can stand in any pool. The hotel is connected by a walkway to Shangri La Plaza shopping mall and is less than a 5 minute walk to SM Mega Mall. This is Manila, the traffic is chaos, there is construction all around the hotel, however, it did not deter us from having a wonderful stay. The hotel is old as are most 5 star hotels in Manila so the rooms do have the shower over the bath, not a walk in one, the decor in the rooms may be a little dated, but bottom line it is a 5 star hotel, it has everything you could possibly want. A note on security - dogs will search all vehicles on entering the bottom of the driveway, there is always a security dog and handler on duty at the entrance to the hotel and your handbag will be scanned on entering the hotel at any entrance. This made us feel safe and we met most of the K9 unit (the dogs) who were well looked after and friendly. You can pat them, they are mostly labradors but there is a beagle as well. Erik from the K9 unit was extremely friendly and always talked to us and told us about the dogs and allowed us to pat them and take photos. Don't be afraid of them they are there for your security and we felt safe. The hotel is approx 13 km from the airport we arrived on a Friday night, the traffic was horrendous it took us 2.5 hours to get to the hotel that night. Going back to the airport it took us 25 minutes. Don;t let this detract you from staying here, just be aware it could happen. Edsa Shangri La is truly an oasis in the concrete jungle and traffic chaos of Manila. I travelled with a party of 5 and we all loved it. Would definitely stay here again.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
"I have to agree with the last reviewer I'm afraid. While the service from the staff is great this just doesn't feel like a 5* business hotel.

My room was small and smelled a bit damp to be honest with you. The TV was very basic and it was all just a bit tired. Shower was old and over the bath for example. These are all just little things but I arrived exhausted straight from LA and needed to be ready to work in Manila for 3 intense days before returning to the UK. I chose this hotel because it's where I've always stayed before when working in Manila (this was my 3rd time). Next time I might need to look again.

The biggest problem though is the internet. It's slow and keeps dropping. I needed to download big documents for my work and this took forever. Little things like this are really frustrating

While the construction/maintenance was a little annoying it feels like it's needed. Particularly because the building is letting the staff down. The staff are everywhere and all lovely. THe food at HEAT is good for a buffet too",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"We thought that Edsa Shangrila was a 5 star hotel and that is why we decided to book our hotel accomodation here. However, we were disappointed for many reasons. There was a construction going on which caused a bit of inconvenience due to the traffic flow. The interior of the room was not rated as a 5 star hotel as they were still using the tube TV. The feeling we got there was like a regular inn 3 star hotel. while we were there, painting works were being done and we could smell the paint on our floor.
The service was good like any other hotels in Manila which I thought was the only positive thing I could comment.",Value for money
"Edsa Shangri-la is a lovely Hotel comprising of two towers - the Garden Wing and the Tower Wing. The Tower wing is currently renovated. I got a room in the Tower wing and the work is really not disturbing. I stayed there for three weeks and did not have reason to complain.
Best part of the hotel must be the pool and garden. The rooms in the tower wing are a bit outdated, especially the bathrooms. I suppose that is why the Tower wing is being renovated. Overall the room was a decent size, fresh fruits daily, uncomplicated internet (wired and wireless throughout) and very clean. The staff is extremely nice and friendly, nothing is a problem or issue. Heat restaurant is average, the Japanese restaurant is exceptional, I did not try the Chinese one and the Italian one did not tempt me (Wagu beef is not really Italian...)
Breakfast was not included in my room rate so this made it a bit more expensive than the comparable Crown Plaza etc, but the Shangri-la Hotel is so much nicer.
As with everywhere in Manila the Hotel is close to several Malls and thereby a great variety of Restaurants. (Mega Mall in particular). From a tourist perspective you are in sightseeing waste land. This is however an ideal Hotel for the business visitor that needs to go to Eastwood etc. I could not find fault and will definitely be back! (April..)
Despite the better value in the Crowne I prefer the Edsa Shangri-la. Tips: sign up to the loyalty program if you stay longer.
Note: The lift can only be operated with a keycard, and then only to the floor where your room is. This can be awkward if you have friends staying on a different floor or if you are expecting visitors as you have to collect them from the Lobby.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Stayed just one night on business recently. While I had stayed here before quite a fair bit of time ago, seems like there have been only minor renovations carried out rather than a really full facelift. Arrived early evening and there were 3 people at the reception area but several people on queue to be served. Typically for such hotels, they would call additional people to serve those on queue to avoid long waits but it was not the case here. They had these tablet like devices where they make you provide guest details and your signature unlike other hotels which do this via hardcopy. I requested for a non-smoking room with a king sized bed but the hotel seemed quite busy as I was told only twin bedded non-smoking rooms were available as well as smoking rooms with a king sized bed. As it was just one night, it was not really worth the hassle of making too much of a fuss around this so I just chose the latter.

The room size was average. There was a love seat and coffee table plus a work desk with an executive chair that was quite comfortable. The bed was a true king sized bed not two twin beds put together where you feel the gap in betwen as I've seen in other hotels. WiFi was free and as there was no individual user IDs with passwords, you can connect as many devices as you want from smartphones, tablets, laptops and whatever else you had. The connection speed was also fairly fast.

Breakfast at HEAT was included with my rate package. The spread was above average compared to other similar class hotels I've stayed at in the Philippines. There was a station where they served the typical Filipino breakfast meals of garlic rice with different kinds of cured meats plus eggs. There was likewise a sushi bar with other Japanese options. The usual Western options of bacon, sausages and potatoes were also present as with Indian breakfast options.

The hotel is connected by a bridge to the 5th floor of the adjacent Shangrila Plaza Mall, which certainly makes shopping and dining convenient. The SM Megamall next door can likewise be reached via a short walk.

The pool area at the Garden wing was quite beautiful. Too bad I did not really have any opportunity to enjoy it on account of my short stay.

Overall while the hotel experience was really satisfactory, the rate I paid for the room, which was a corporate rate by the way, was quite high. For that price I thought that the hotel could provide better value in terms of facilities and services. I personally would NOT pay that price if I were to pay from my own pocket so were I not on business, I probably would not stay here because of that.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Maybe the hotel is just too busy and crowded, our late arrival (11pm) at the hotel did not have warm welcome from the hotel staff. The reception helping my boss was so cool too. I stayed here in 2008 and it was GREAT, but after all these years, rooms get old and glad that some are under renovation. The room I had was damp with smell. Luckily hotel arranged another one for me. But not much different, the second room is just less smelly. I had to get changed and go to bed for next day meeting. Just stayed as it as I guess all the rooms are the same.
My 2 colleagues had one comment to me ""the room is old"" the next morning. We had a choice to choose between Pennisula Manila and this one, turned out I recommended this as per my memory that this was good and last time I stayed at Pennisula, room was old too! Here, the lobby is so grand but definitely not the rooms.. I care about the room condition as I will stay in most of the time during weekend. Hotel just arranged me an ionizer in the room now. Hope it will get better. Anyway, 5 more nights to go. Good night!",Comfort & Facilities
"I must say that the staff is extremely pleasant and friendly so if a ""good morning"", ""good evening"" or ""good afternoon"" offends you then I am pretty sure you probably stole Christmas. The staff is amazing and they do their best to try to learn your name and learn your likes and dislikes to make your stay there more enjoyable. I really enjoyed the Heat restaurant and Rico makes some of the best omelets if you are there during the breakfast buffet. It has a nice swimming pool but due to the timing of my work schedule. It is walking distance from malls and about 40 minutes from the airport (with traffic). I must say that the prices at the restaurants were a pretty penny but the room service prices seemed more reasonable. They also provide for currency exchange at the front desk but if you want a better rate for your money then check out the Shangri La Mall and you will get a few more PHPs for your dollar.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"My family & I stayed for 2 nights and it's the same hotel I stayed in like...10 years ago. It is luxurious and regal. The atmosphere is different from the new boutique hotels who probably offer the same kind of service. But hey, it's Shanri-La. It does need some renovations but they should still maintain the grand & luxurious feel.

We were given the superior room with 2 double beds arranged together and my son would sink in the middle of the 2 beds. I'm not nit-picky with bathrooms, but it was a bit disappointing to pay that kind of money for a bathroom that needs a little maintenance. There were cracks on the tile surrounding the tub and the sink w/c was fixed with some kind of white cement. It made me laugh when my son said ""now that's one rough towel"". It's not a real concern but its something you would't expect from a Shangri-La hotel. Even the TV needs to be replaced I think. It occupies a huge space in the room.

There was a huge construction going on beside the hotel which was an eye sore. Not a concern once again, but not very appealing for tourists. The best part for me was the breakfast at Heat. It was even better than the wide variety served by its predecessor, the garden cafe. Excellent breakfast buffet!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"I was disappointed in the Edsa Shangri-La. The positives are the staff who are very welcoming and friendly but sadly the hotel is past its prime and looks very tired. I understand that the rooms are being refurbished and maybe when that has happened it would be worth a re-visit but for a business traveller there are now better places to stay.

One other issue, it is correct that the Breakfast buffet is magnificent. But the dining area is crowded and noisy - it is very difficult at peak times to get a table to yourself and it is not conducive to business meetings. So a great place if you are on holiday but not for work.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"This hotel is busy! Always a lot of people in the lobby and function rooms are full. Checking in was a breeze, concierge and front desk staff were very helpful (as I only had enough time to check In before the meeting started, so they brought my bags to the room). There seems to be a surplus of staff, as there were two girls just helping people at the elevator and another handful of people ferrying the guests at the lobby. You needed a key card to get to the room, which was great. They were doing some renovations while I was there and I was warned that there could be some noise, but I didn't really hear anything (renovations were on the top floor, I was on the 5th). The room was very clean and had the usual amenities. They gave the guests fresh mangoes during the turn down service. This hotel has an adjoining walkway that takes you to the Shangri-la Mall where there are a lot of good restaurants and shops. The hotel's own Heat restaurant was great too.

Booked a usual room day after the wedding while we got the garden suite for a few days. We actually had a tower suite reservation but due to repairs we had to be moved to a smaller suite. After a few email and arguments, we got upgraded to the Shangri la suite. It was very spacious considering it was just me and my wife there. Though dated, it's still can please you somehow. The garden wing is more quiet but the main hotel lounge where the tower wing is was too busy and lots of people were roaming around. The mall was a few hundred meters away. The bar costs a lot.

"From the door and elevator persons to the concierge they all greet you with ""Have an excellent day."" Excellent, indeed! I arrived at 9 a.m. to attend a black-tie affair in the evening. I was already expecting to be told that check-in is at 2 p.m. and would have to wait until a room is ready. Instead, I was welcomed by charming Charlene at the front desk. She said it's been a while since my last stay (November 2012); she even remembered to note down that I have difficulty sleeping in separate twin beds so she looked for one that had a king size bed. Voila, the room was ready in all of 10 minutes! Needed a 445 a.m. airport transfer the following day. Arranged pronto. She even apologized in advance for the noise coming from the construction of the upper floors (I stayed in the 13th--lucky I guess). As usual, the room was well maintained, housekeeping well beyond polite. By now, everyone has raved about the hotel being sandwiched between two giant malls. Aside from food and shopping, there's cinemas, a bowling alley, a skating rink; entertainment bars and bistros within walking distance. For devout Catholics, the St. Francis church is just a stone's throw away. But wait, the best is yet to come. By the 3rd quarter of 2013, the renovations would have been done and we certainly can't wait. For now, have an excellent day.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location

Situated at the crossroads of EDSA and Shaw Boulevard, you can easily drive to the hotel coming from Quezon City, Ortigas, Makati or even Manila. So, from two different companies, we set a 9:00 a.m. breakfast at the opulent lobby. Upon settling down on the low couch and a nice table in the center, our party of six ordered from the limited menu. Most of the menu selection were simple sandwiches or cereals/muesli for breakfast. It was ideal though for dieters and those who prefer a small breakfast. The coffee mug was big and we had a good fill of well brewed coffee. The Heat sandwich was quite a serving and four people shared it together with potato chips. The eggs benedict looked delicious atop the muffin bread. I love my muesli served with strawberry and blueberry jam. Though the breakfast was simple, it was quite filling that I skipped breakfast.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Edsa Shangri-La is the most luxurious, best managed and the friendliest hotel I have ever stayed in. I stayed there for 2 weeks in May 2012 on business. It is located in the very well communicated area. Very close to Manila Metro expressway and MRT-3 overhead rail – station Shaw Boulevard. Very cheap and convenient way to avoid traffic. To say that hotel is clean, shining and service is awesome is needless. Lobby is very spacy with huge brilliant composition of fresh flower in the middle. Changed every few days – what an aroma… Amazing. I would say the room is not standing out as much as the other part of the hotel. It is very good, comfortable with high-speed internet, fresh fruits, nice colonially stylized furniture and comfortable bathroom. The drawback was that room was not very spacy.
Not only the hotel was the best I ever stayed by it also served the best breakfast I have ever eaten. In fact it was combination of breakfast, lunch and dinner. Since Manila is pretty much 24-hrs city at the time of breakfast some guest could have dinner. Variety of food, fruits, snacks, pastries, soups, hot dishes, deserts was just stunning. The you can have a culinary around the world round during just one meal. On the first day I literally could not make my choice. All endlessly fresh and tasty. Yum, yum… This stuff cost a lot – it was also the most expensive breakfast :-) I have not eaten other meals – dinner or lunch in one of the few hotel restaurants but I bet it would be great too. I have visited gym – a lot of spinning and jogging equipment. One thing – especially if you stay on business – you should use outdoor pool. Edsa has two wings with beautifully maintained garden in between – in the heart of the garden between palm trees – there is a pool. Very easy to switch to holiday mode, just few steps from paradise.
Edsa Shangri-La is also conveniently located for shopping freaks. Megamall (really mega) is within 2 mins walk, on the other side of the hotel – Shangri-la Plaza Mall – even closer. You can reach it from the hotel premises thru covered walkway – important to avoid tropical rains.
Last but not least – female part of staff – the collection of ultimate Asian beauties – please watch out not to remain speechless with the mouth wide open… it looks stupid ;-) I cannot recommend this hotel more.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This hotel has impeccable service. It truly makes being away for business so much easier and downright decadent. Allergies to down, problems with the construction noise, cigarette smoke wafting in through my vents from another hotel room - I had all these issues during my stay. Luckily all were dealt with quickly (after a couple calls each, which I think would be the same as in the US). Per the construction, I'd recommend asking for a room on the 5th or 6th floor. I at first was on the 12th floor and the sound was deafening. I can only imagine that when there's not construction going on, it is perfection. The rooms are a little old, but still incredibly clean and really lovely. I loved the fresh fruit in the room every day and all the bottled water you want, on demand. And the breakfast is the best one I have ever had in any hotel. It will blow your mind - the have Japanese breakfast and sushi, Chinese dim sum and congee, Indian hot foods and naan and paratha, Western made-to-order omelettes, bacon, etc, and European baked goods (about 15 different kinds, like almond croissants, muffins, danishes, all amazing and better than most American high end bakeries), Filipino, made-to-order fresh smoothies and noodle soups.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Edsa Shang is the best. From the moment you arrive, you are greeted by smiles and the most courteous, friendly staff I've ever come across. The pool is the most beautiful in Manila, a tranquil city oasis (though soon undergoing renovation so be forewarned), and the buffet breakfast (typically included in the rate) gives you an array of choices that can be in the overwhelming category. Edsa Shang is ideally situated next to the Shangri-la and Mega malls and close to several others, so it's a great Manila stop-off if you are traveling elsewhere in the Philippines or are on a business trip and want easy access to restaurants and shops.

Everything in my room was clean, in order, and in perfect working condition. Although, I see that the rooms would appreciate an updated interior decoration a bit of freshening up.

There is no need to discuss the buffet breakfast as it is one of the best in Manila. I could easily fill up for the rest day from the all the offerings.

"Edsa Shangri-La

I recently stayed here for 2-weeks on business and I must say this was a pleasant experience. Everything was absolutely perfect from the staff to the food. I was a bit concerned when arriving and had called reservations a few times as I had heard there was construction going on in the main Tower wing. As I had to work nights during my stay, I would need to sleep during the days. I was concerned that the noise would be an issue. I was assured they would have me placed away from the construction prior to arriving, however this was not the case and on the first day at 6:30am the jack hammering began. I must say the management was extremely quick to react and immediately moved me to the Garden wing, which was perfect for the remainder of my stay.

STAFF
Truly the best! I have stayed in many hotels, in many locations, and by far the Edsa Shangri-La staff have been one of the best. I was extremely impressed and cannot think of anything to say that would need improvement.

FOOD
I mostly frequented the HEAT restaurant and the buffet, which had a wide variety of foods and all were extremely good. Again, hard to complain about anything and the buffet’s at HEAT were some of the best I have had. I also ate at Paparazzi and found this to be excellent as well. Service again, impeccable!! The in room dining experience was also done very well, with some of the fastest service I have ever seen in a hotel of such size. I was always polity informed that my in room service would be ready within 30-minutes and each time I do not think I waited more than 15 or 20 minutes. The food was always hot and serviced with class by those delivering to the door.

POOL
This was a great escape and a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of this major city. The landscaping is well down, the pool is very clean and well maintained and the staff are extremely attentive. Everyone remembers your name and is welcoming each time they see you. I was very surprised to see that there were not very many guests at the pool, at least not in the mornings. I frequented the pool each morning after work from 7:30am – 10/11am and on most days had the entire pool to myself.

I did not try the spa, but was told by a colleague that the spa service was exceptional.

ROOMS
As stated above the Tower wing is being renovated, so there is construction going on. I was in a very nice, large King Deluxe room on my arrival, which was a bit dated, but was still well kept. I can however see why they are renovating these rooms. When moved to the Garden wing I was put into a very nicely appointed renovated room. If possible I would recommend requesting a room in the Garden wing, especially if you need to sleep during the day hours. It was extremely quiet and comfortable and made my stay that much more enjoyable. The room Wi-Fi was also very good and I did not have any trouble with connecting and at very good speeds. This was actually noticed throughout the hotel, including the pool area, which I was pleasantly surprised about.

TIPS
If you are an extended stay guest check with the concierge about hotel excursions for extended stay guests. A colleague and I participated in a day of shopping at the famous Green Hills Market, Laser Tag and museum excursion, all put on by the hotel. We had a designated tour guide, security and a private driver and the expense was all taken care of by the hotel. This is a great feature for those who are staying for a few weeks or more and gives a safe way to get out and see the city and culture.

The HEAT Chicken Club sandwich, one of the best! Try it.

There is direct access to the Plaza Mall in the hall connecting to the Garden Wing. Very nice mall with many higher end shops. Also some good places for a quick bite to eat and a large cinema.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"I was at EDSA Shangri-La in October 2012 and thoroughly enjoyed the property. It's close to a mega mall and grocery store, the hotel is immaculate on the inside, the staff is friendly as with every Shangri-La property & the restaurants are awesome.

I spent most of my days at work, but my evenings were spent enjoying the hotel & all the amenities it had to offer. The rooms were extremely spacious, offering a good amount of room for a business traveler like myself who came to the Philippines with lots of extras! Make sure to ask for a room in the ""new"" tower, they're much nicer than the old tower.

One thing that I've noticed about many Shangri-La properties is that their breakfast buffet is insanely awesome. They offer a very international breakfast that is fitting to many cultures. In addition to their international breakfast buffet, the staff in the hotel speaks multiple languages making it a very traveler friendly location.

I would definitely recommend EDSA Shangri-La to anyone who is looking to travel to the Philippines.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

I cannot even pull the drapes together properly. I like the hotels with overlapping curtain rods like this one, but the right curtain doesn't pull to the end so there is a gap.

The room doesn't live up to the Club level expectation. I'm disappointed. However the Club lounge is good and the complimentary high speed internet in the room is good. You will need an adaptor as the voltage is not 110 but the hotel will loan a convertor to charge your phone, etc.",Comfort & Facilities
"Love the location, the hospitality, the rooms, the housekeeping, HEAT,(breakfast) you have all the food you want to eat. Meat, Japanese, local, seafood. YUM. I would definitely come back. Connected to Shangri-la mall where you can find a drug store, groceries, food court. Stayed two years ago. Also walking distance to SM Megamall which is one of the biggest malls in Manila.

"Instead of going out of the country to celebrate our anniversary, my husband and I decided to stay at Edsa Shangri-la instead. Being a member of their Club Gourmet i was able to get my room with a huge discount. The stay was as usual, great! Although the check-in process took me for almost an hour. I pity the three staff who was on the front desk at the time of my check-in. The very looong lines and the not so friendly, irritated guest (foreign and local) waiting to be served. i commend Ms. Malen of the front desk for doing her job well and the housekeeping at the 10th flr of Garden Wing (Mr. Mike) All in all, the hotel staff are very friendly, courteous and accommodating. Food was great at Heat restaurant. Definitely, will come back if my time permits.",Staff:Food
"Its a good hotel in Manila or I must say in Phillipines, Best part of my visit to Manila was only hotel stay. Staff is very good, many things to do in hotel itself, rooms are big. The best thing is wine collection in bar, they are having separate wine bar with a very good ambiance.",Food:Location
"More than anything else, this hotel has the most amazing breakfast buffet spread. Literally cuisines from anywhere and everywhere in the world. I would stay there again longer just to spend more time at the buffet! :-)

Other than that, a good hotel, good location (right in the middle of the city, and next to the Asian Development Bank and two huge malls). The lobby area is super crowded all the time though and makes it obvious that this hotel is the place to hang out for a lot of meetings social or professional.

Service is very good, rooms are comfortable, well appointed, and the swimming pool area is a real oasis. I shall stay here again if the occasion ever arises.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Only the HEAT restaurant is worth the stay. As others wrote, there is a mold /damp smell in the air which I think made me sick (Garden Wing). Bathrooms are bad, with little hot water.

"This review is in regards to my stay at this hotel from Nov 17-23. My stay was on level 12 of the Garden Wing.

My son and I were greeted at the airport by a representative from the hotel. I was addressed professionally and with a smile. Upon arriving at the hotel, we were greeted with a smile by Bernadette, who ushered us straight into our Horzon Club room. This immediately brought a smile to my face, walking right past the people checking in at the front desk, etc. Our bags came with us and didn't leave our sight. We were briefed on a few details before Bernadette left us in our room.

Our room itself was well kept, medium to large and more than adequate. Modern. With a 30-something inch LED or LCD tv. Nice to see the bathroom accessories are L'Occitane, which my wife loves, but unfortunately she's not with us on this trip.

My son and I had some late nights and sampled the in-room dining two of the nights we were here. We were informed of approx. how long the order will take to get to our room. When the waiters arrived, they set up the table and arranged everything nicely before leaving. Again, service with a smile.

Thanks to my maternal grandmother, I have always stayed at 5 star hotels overseas. The most recent being Makati Shang. It is the little gestures - the attention to certain details that for me, show how good a hotel's staff are.

One of those that I mentioned in a previous review is how they handle my son's soft toys. They're always on the bed wherever we go. Some places just throw them in a heap on a chair. Here, we were delighted every day to see them arranged in playful ways. It became the talk of my son and my nieces how his toys might be arranged when we got back to the room. Two of the days, towels were folded into animals and placed with his toys. Kudos to you, EDSA Shang.

The pool staff were attentive. My son knows how to swim so they wouldn't have needed saving, but we were greeted courteously and the banana lounge was covered in a towel for me before sitting down to do my work while the little man made good use of the water slide.

During the entire stay, it was nice to not only be addressed by name, but also for them to remember my son's name when visiting the Horizon Lounge in the Garden Wing. Thank you to Bernadette and Jackie at the Horizon Lounge for being so accomodating and helpful. Jackie in particular one-upping our simple requests to go the extra mile consistently.

It's service like this that earns my loyalty.

Check-out is the only thing I wish was as smooth as check-in. I was told to drop the room card at the front desk, which was busy so I had to wait just to hand my room cards in. It would be nice to just leave them in the room like in some hotels for quick check-out. I had already paid all dues the night before check-out.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I'm currently staying at this hotel, in my room, writing this review because when i first arrived i was disappointed, and wasn't happy with my room. The hotel is dated, and is in the process of being upgraded (there is construction going on in the tower rooms).

One of the reasons why i booked a room at a Shangri-La hotel is because i stayed at the Shangri-La in Vancouver - Canada, and assumed that the one in the Philippines would be just as nice. Unfortunately, i wasn't too happy, and called the front desk to talk to a manager. The manager arrived in my room in about 15 minutes, and listened to my concerns. He was apologetic, and wanted to do his best to ensure that i was a happy guest. The hotel was fully booked and wasn't able to move me into another room right away, but he worked really hard at making sure that he could fix the problem. All of the rooms in the hotel were fully booked, but said that he would ensure that he will do his best at moving me to another room as soon as possible. The on duty manager acted in a professional manner and did a good job at handling the situation with a difficult customer. The Manager's name is Warren and should be recognized for his hard work. I was later notified that i would be moved to another room. The message was passed to another manager because Warren's was shift was about to end. The new on-duty manager assisted my move to another room and i was very happy. His name is Rowal (i think i got the spelling wrong - sorry!), and throughout my stay i bumped into him a few times in the hallways (assisting me in additional room request and hotel services) and just to say hello. Each time we meet, he was very friendly and wanted me to be happy and feel welcomed. He does a good job at handling all the many difficult customers and problems that land on his desk. I was later contacted my Sridhar - Director of Rooms, and came to me to apologize for the room that i was originally booked into, and said it was his fault for not ensuring that the room was not up to the high standards that Shangri-La offers. I wasn't looking for anymore apologies, but Sridhar took the time to follow up with unhappy customer and wanted to make sure that everything was better. The hotel is a 20 year old property, and once the room renovations are complete, i think all of the other negative reviews that you read on tripadvisor will disappear.

Besides some of the dated rooms which need remodelling (which are in the process of being upgraded), the hotel amenities are great, and the location is good. I spent some time by the pool, and found it to be relaxing with a nice atmosphere. If you wish to do some shopping, SM MegaMall is just next door (a quick 3 minute walk). The mall is HUGE and has lots of stores and restaurants to choose from. There is also the Shangri-La Plaza Shopping Mall. At first i thought it was just a small hotel type of mall, but its a very LARGE mall with lots of everything. On my first day of arriving the philippines, i went here to buy a local sim card for my iPhone. All the major cell phone carriers have storefronts next door to each other. I picked up a SMART sim card for only 40 pesos and bought some load (lucky, they had nano sized sim cards that fit into iPhone 5's).

If your looking for a bit of adventure to see how the locals live, it might be kind of fun to take the public train system (called MRT), and then a Jeepeny (kind of like a open air mini bus type of car) to Mall of Asia (the largest mall in Asia). Just make sure you keep your cell phone, jewellery, and anything valuable in your pocket at all times. I only recommend doing this during the day time, and be very careful. The hotel is connected to Shangri-La Plazza Mall though a covered walkway type of bridge which is protected by security, and the MRT is connected to the Shangri-La Mall (so it's quite easy and safe to get to the MRT - just ask for directions in the mall). It cost 12 pesos for a one-way ticket to Taft Avenue (you'll be going south bound - it's the very last stop, and you'll see everyone get off the train). once you exit the train station, you will see people on the street holding a sign saying ""Mall of Asia"" yelling at the top of there lungs. You will notice people jumping into the jeepeny with the words printed on the side saying ""Mall of Asia."" Give the driver 8 pesos, and off you go to the largest mall in all of asia. I recommend keeping some loose change in your pocket so that you don't have to take out your wallet/purse, and that way you don't have to worry about breaking large bills and getting the correct change. once your done at mall of asia, i would just take a taxi back to the hotel. one time using the public transit system is enough, and if you have shopping bags with you, you don't want to worry about them getting stolen or lost. If you have any questions, simply ask the concierge for help and directions.

I'm having a great stay, and the management team is professional and curious. If you have a problem, just ask for help nicely, and they will be glad to help. The location is good if you like shopping because of the large malls next door with lots of restaurants and stores to choose from.

"I was picked up at the airport by a hotel car. Most welcome after a day's travel from LHR. Upon arrival it appeared that I was staying on a building site, but as soon as I entered the hotel all was well (after being semi-frisked by security, naturally. I ended up staying in the Garden Wing on the 14th floor (Club floor). As club rooms go, this was quite dated, although did still offer all the comforts one could ask for from a hotel. The bed wasn't the best I have experienced in a hotel but was adequate. My air conditioning was not working for the first night but once reported it was fixed very quickly and a note left by maintenance which was a nice touch.

The club lounge (and breakfast) was excellent although I did not get to sample the offerings of an evening. I was surprised that evening service ends at 7pm - given Manila's traffic and business people's work schedule I felt this a touch mean spirited.

The service at the hotel is exemplary. I have never met nicer, more courteous staff. I would visit this hotel again purely for that reason when returning to Manila on business.

Breakfast in the club lounge was great, including an a la carte menu as well as a buffet (not the typical western fry up which was nice). The coffee is excellent. I didn't get to try the HEAT restaurant unfortunately but it looked good.

The hotel pool looked really impressive and considering how built up Manila is, there was a good amount of sunlight all day long (from what I saw of it anyhow). I can't speak regarding what the pool area was like unfortunately.

Worth noting that when returning to the airport, you have to pay 550PHP (thanks to the very kind assistant on check out for telling me this!!).",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Having stayed in multiple Shangri-La hotels in Asia including the one in Makati, I find this Shangri-La in need of some fine tuning. The service was nice and friendly but when I was getting out of the cab no one offered to take my luggage from me and I had to carry it all the way up to the Horizon Club. They were really accommodating with my request except for the room preference of having me on the side away from construction probably because it was fully booked on that side for non-smoking club rooms, but then again i paid in advance more than a month from my stay. When I went to have lunch at HEAT they actually took 10 mins to find my table even if I did reserve ahead of time as I am well aware that their lunch buffet is really popular. Overall the trip was nice, the club rooms seem newly renovated and refreshed, the service was nice and it can really be considered 5-star, but its the finer things that make Shangri-La different from other 5-star hotels, and this property needs some of that.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"I stay here frequently when in the Philippines mainly because of the close proximity to the SM megamall next door! The rooms themselves are pretty average but serrvice is superb which more than makes up for it! This is the problem with staying in good hotels that we start to continue increasing our standards to the extent that when I have a bathroom with plastic shower curtains, I think it's time for them to upgrade the bathroom!

But as I said, it's adequate although on this occasion, I stayed in room 1104 and found that the power sockets on ther desk have stopped working! I'm checking out this morning and my way to Bangkok so haven;t reported this yet.

The decor in the room is a little dated but the bed is so-o-o comfortable! I just wish that i had more time to spend in it!

The pool area is very pretty but again, I haven;t had time to try it, despite my saying that I will every time I come here! Heat, the restaurant on the ground floor has a superb buffet with choiices to suit all tastes! I love the fresh mango!

The tariff seems to be creeping up but the hotel is very busy with many conferences on and coming up to Christmas so this is probably the reason.

There's lots of renovation going on at the moment so can be quite noisy during the day with the pneumatic hammers chattering away but they did warn me about this on checking in!

The cold water pressure in this room was very weak but the hot water was fine

Summarising though, it's a good place to stay with the main reason being the megamall!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
We stayed at the hotel in october and had a great overall experience. We just wanted to chill out for a week after visiting our daughter in Hong Kong and found it to be up to the Shangri la's usual high standard.

"Who would have thought we'll end up in Shangri-La? Kidding aside, we never planned on staying there since we always loved the Pan Pacific! But we ran out of hotels with a resort-like feel in the middle of the city, and boy, we decided to pack our things and head straight to Edsa Shangri-la. There's a lot of constructions going on, renovation of its namesake mall and residential condominium. A bit disappointed with the man on the front desk, not smiling, and even told us that our breakfast is not included for the two night’s stay we have booked. Then i reminded him that IT IS included and he might as well read the print-out for our reservation. But he apologizes and suddenly put on a smile and told us that we will have unlimited internet, unlimited laundry etc....They also apologized for the noise which we have to endure from 10am to 6pm. I was expecting a grand room on the tower wing, a bit outdated but huge enough for the three of us, (they MUST change the television and the furniture!)The bathroom is quite small for a Shangri-La standard. We love the view of the Ortigas Business Center. The breakfast selections at HEAT were superb! The best! The restaurant staffs are very accommodating and very attentive to every whim of their guests. What we enjoyed most, and it’s our top choice of facility when staying in a hotel, was the magnificent pool. I would say better than Sofitel's and way better than Pan Pacific. My son enjoyed swimming on the pool, especially at night with all the beautiful lights! The lobby lounge has this perfect view of the garden, very relaxing. The mezzanine level has the best bar (PAPARAZZI) and uber-chic restaurants (dimsum at SUMMER PALACE and a sushi bar at SENJU). The restaurants interiors are quite fabulous! We love browsing the many luxurious shops (mostly jewellery shops, but they should have a better selections of breads and pastry on the pastry shop. Overall, we had so much fun and my 3 year old son requested that we should have stayed longer. We have a free shuttle service and all I could say was the driver was very professional and friendly. We will definitely come back!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Stayed here for the first time after many stays at the Shangri-la in Makati. Good hotel with quite a few shopping centres nearby. However, not quite the same class as the other Shangri-la and I prefer Makati as a location and because it is so much closer to the airport. Had a club room and the service in the club lounge was good except that check-out was a bit tortuous (around 15 minutes even with no queue).",Food:Location:Staff
"Checking in to Shangri-La for a couple of nights while on holiday was the best decision ever made. The interior is stunningly beautiful and elegant while the staff were so warm, welcoming, and seem genuinely happy to be there. The concierge also directed us to some local events that we wouldn't have known how to get to otherwise.

The room itself was well equipped with toiletries, mini bar items, free wi-fi, and best of all, fresh fruit every day. The pool area was inviting, clean, well-staffed, and was a lovely distraction after a big day out.

Breakfast at the Heat was also incredible, now the standard by which all breakfasts will be measured against. The selection included a wide range of standard breakfast items such as pastries, pancakes, and fruits, made to order noodles, crepes, and eggs, as well as indian, filipino, and japanese dishes.

"I was able to stay here a few years ago and I can honestly say that their service has tremendously improved. Check-in was quite easy and the rooms in the garden wing were very clean and the color scheme was pleasant to the eye.
I stayed with my entire family so we had connecting rooms. I liked the fact that each of our rooms had sofa beds and the room of my kids had extra bath tub toys which they really loved. The guest relations officer, Joy Reyes, made my entire family feel welcomed including my kids. She even sent up 2 tetra-packs of milk with some goodies for my babies.
I also had an event during our stay and the service I got from my head waiters, Frank and Ayer, and their team was truly commendable. Janine Cue from Events also ensured that my event took place without a hitch.
The only thing that prevented me from giving a perfect rating was their lack of parking space. My guests had difficulty with that and the valet service was no longer available. This was very disappointing since the hotel should have ensured that they have adequate parking space for guests or at least they could have provided an alternative.
Overall, it was still a good stay for my family. My kids loved the pool and we loved the food, as always.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Edsa Shangri-la Manila is one of the better hotels in the Philippine capital and largest metropolis, offering value for money in terms of service, facilities and product choices.

Rooms are very clean and well-appointed, with each one giving good views of the Ortigas Business Districts (although rooms facing the Greenhills/Wack Wack Mandaluyong area is recommended because at least you see more trees and spaces, not just neighboring buildings).

The lobby is spacious as well. Typical of the Shangri-La brand, you will be greeted by a lush garden at the foreground of the lobby coffee shop.

It is also a paradise for foodies. Superb restos, wide array of choices, such as Senju for Japanese food, Summer Palace for Chinese. For more and mixed options, Heat Restaurant is for you. Personally loved Heat because of the choices. Another favorite for my company meetings is the lobby coffee shop--serves the best coffee and cookies in town!

The convenience and being beside world-class malls (Shangri-La Mall and SM Megamall) and within a vibrant central business district is a plus for those who love shopping and those with transactions in any of the multinational located in the area.

Hotel staff are genuinely friendly and efficient. Always smling :)

Best all of all, you get of these for competitive rates: for as low at P6,000+++ (local resident ratre)!

What Idont like about it lately is that the owners of the Shangri-La complex decided to erect a building beside it, demolishing a parking lot dotted with trees and distracting portions of the Wack Wack view. Also the complex itself feels so crowded.

"We stayed in this hotel before and had enjoyed meals at The Heat for numerous times. But what makes this particular hotel quite different from the rest, is how it would make you feel even after you left it.

Checking in is definitely a breeze. The one at the front desk, Rizza, is so helpful and was gracious enough to offer us an upgrade of room when our room of choice was found to be fully booked. Upon learning of our previous stay, she courteously offered us a discount for this upgrade!

The room is clean, a bowl of fresh fruits was given as a welcome gesture. The bathroom is clean as well and boasts a good brand of toiletries. We had a good sleep, the room is both quiet and comfortably cool.

If you wish to shop at the Shangrila mall, there is a connecting bridge from the hotel to the mall. A dry way to reach the mall even with a heavy downpour.

The hotel staff are very polite and helpful. How I wish they can get to lecture this demeanor to the staff of a certain hotel where I stayed last year! Breakfast at The Heat is just as expected... Heavenly!

After our stay, the hotel sent us an email, inquiring about our experience. This is what counts a lot! Their attention to these details, inquiring even after you left, etc., simply puts the hotel and its management a echelon higher than the rest.",Staff:Food

The connections to two malls (Megamall and Shangri-La Plaza) means that anything you need is close.

"After reading some of the reviews about outdated rooms I was a little worried- however my fears were soon gone.
We arrived at the hotel mid afternoon to a very warm welcome and were escorted to the check-in desk after passing through security. My King room was not ready but I was offered a welcome drink in the lobby while I waited. As the room was taking a while I was offered another room to relax in until mine was ready. It did take a few hours which was my only gripe.
I stayed in a horizon room in the garden room and was very impressed. It was fresh and modern. I was working at night and sleeping during the day. The room was quiet and when the curtains were closed there was no light in the room either. A quick phone call and my room was cleaned- even at night. I also had access to the business centre and horizon lounge.
The choices for breakfast were amazing and this was a real highlight.
The Shangri La mall is connected via a walkway and a highscale shopping area. A few hundred yards away is MegaMall.
If the rooms that people have complained about are upgraded to the same level as the room I stayed in it will be an amazing hotel for everyone.

"i stayed here for 6 weeks for business in 2010. the location was good for work as it was located in Ortigas. other than SM Megamall across the street there's not really much to do in the area. then again you can pretty much find everything at SM Megamall. also the Shangri-La mall was quite good with a decent amount of restaurants.

the room was simple and comfy. though after 6 weeks you do start to become a bit claustrophobic. some of the appliances did seem dated though. i'm sure the Shangri-La could upgrade to flat panel TVs.

staff and service were great. in less than a week a lot of the staff already knew my name and were always super courteous. anything i requested they facilitated quickly. room service was quick and quite good.

the breakfast buffet was quite good. having western and Asian foods. though during beak breakfast it was quite crowded. prices were a bit high compared to your standard Filipino prices. then again you would expect that from a Shangri-La.

went to CHI Spa almost twice a week and it was amazing. again pricey compared to going elsewhere, but the service was amazing. i recommend the the kelp wrap if you're trying to get over some jet lag.

i would definitely stay again if the opportunity came up, but perhaps opt to go to the Makati Shangri-La. a bit more updated and right in the middle of everything.",Location:Food:Value for money
"Like many of the big hotels in Manila, this one has seen better days. Nothing is wrong, but it does need updating. Still has old TVs and could use freshening up in places. There are some vey nice Shangri La's in Asia. This one is more about the name than the image.

Rooms are good, but not swish. Biggest problem is the multitude of people at breakfast. Seems that each room must have had 4 people in it . It is like feeding time at a zoo. Not the crisp white linen table cloths and service you expect from the Shangri La name. I can't see how the hotel could house all the people who were eating breakfast.

Trouble is that the place is not cheap. I would not rate it as a top 5 star hotel. Hard to get in and out off due to construction work and just the volume of people.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"When doing extensive renovations and noisy construction, hotels should really be more transparent about it when reservations are made. I am on day 5 of a 9 night stay for business and I am extremely disappointed in the hotel so far.

When I first arrived they informed me of the noise and asked if I would be in the hotel during the day, to which I replied: YES. They then put me on the 12th floor as opposed to the 14th. I was knocked out of bed the next morning with drilling and hammering.

After a request to be moved they offered me a smoking room, which I rapidly declined. They reluctantly gave me an executive room on the 9th floor. Well, the fabric on the walls is black with mold or grime, as is the lining of the curtains. The furniture is sagging. Everything is threadbare and tired. The noise is still so unbearable that I have to leave the hotel by 9am in order to make calls. My office only opens after midday.

Although the staff are very friendly, their treatment of men or couples if far superior than that of a single women traveling for business.

The gym is very busy in the mornings, and people do not wipe down equipment after use. The treadmill I used had a short in the wiring and sent electric shocks down my headphones. The trainers/attendants did not seem to care that much about it.

In general the hotel lobby, elevator and public space is very tired and tatty. Perhaps they should have shut down shop in order to complete the renovations.

All in all a very expensive 9 day trip in a 5 star hotel, only worthy of 3 stars. The only reason it did not receive an overall rating of 1 is because the breakfast is good, coffee hot and my pillow is very comfortable.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

If you want to shop or eat out, it has it's own mall across from the hotel and another big one only a few minutes away. Definitely a good location.

"Rennovations are always welcome in a hotel but at what expense? This may sound trivial to some of you but this evening at peak hour, i waited in the driveway for around 15 minutes because they only had one guard and one bomb sniffing dog checking what must have been at least 50 backed up cars waiting to be checked and causing traffic. Instead of anger at the security measure, i saw how exhausted the guard and the dog were. They were circling every car. enough to render any decent human or animal dizzy. Then they open the trunk and inhale the exhaust...over and over again...No alternate...just them and this other guard who held a stop and go sign..
I could not help myself from complaining to the duty manager. Before getting to the front desk, i did various quick interviews with the staff i saw on the way to the lobby...dogs can sniff for bombs, i can sniff for mismanagement. All of them said it was cost cutting to pay for the rennovation! The GM ( i have written about him before) is quite notorious for being profit and not service oriented
Finally spoke to the duty manager and he apologized and said he would do something about it.
After an hour and a half, i left the hotel. Drriving out, the cars were still backed up and there was still one guard with one dog doing the car search...fortunately he was being assisted now by at least six security men. Thank you mr. duty manager for trying at least to do something.
Mr. GM, it appears that profit is more important to you than a good working team. it appears that you don;t care about animal rights as long as you can cut corners. At the end of the day, you may have a profitable hotel but the service will be so bad because your team is so tired and un motivated.

"My friend and I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in a club room. Check-in was a breeze, the club lounge was cozy and very silent. Complimentary breakfast is included in our room and you can order from their menu and also get some food from the buffet spread, but it has such a limited choice, so I suggest you go for both. Their waffles were great, also their corned beef hash. For club rooms it has a complimetary snacks, cocktails and canapes served daily. For the snacks, they only have a very very limited choice, mostly muffin, cookie, chips; but the cocktails and canapes at night is worth the try. I'm just shocked because I was expecting a little bit more because going from one hotel to another, I could definitely see a huge difference. Our room was cozy, nice and elegant. The pillows we requested were served, great amenities, and very modern electronics. The odd thing about our room is that it doesn't have a separate shower room and bathtub unlike other 5-star hotels. They also didn't have a bedet. For the elevators you have to wait a little bit longer because there's only 2 elevators available.

We tried to have dinner at HEAT and we were very excited because of the raves about it. The buffet has fusions of different kinds of cuisines but overall it was not worth it. It was too expensive and yet they the buffet spread is not that magnificent. They only have 2 carvings, the roast beef and peking duck, that's it. The food was bland and there's actually noting special about them. My only favorite part in this buffet was the crepe station and the ice cream teppanyaki.

Overall, service was awesome and staffs were really nice and helpful. When I'm walking in the hallways, going to the club lounge or calling the phone operator, they all know my name, which is a surprise. The hotel is mostly for business travelers and not for pleasure and family. But I would definitely stay here again in the future.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

"Whenever my wife and I go to Manila we always stay in Shangri-La EDSA. In my opinion it's the best hotel in Manila, and we've stayed in a few! I do not like staying at Shangri-La Makati as in my opinion it's well over priced, the level of service is nowhere near as good as that in the EDSA hotel. The staff can never do enough to help you, and although tipping in the Philippines is an almost expected custom, you never feel like the staff are waiting for you to get your wallet out....other Manila hotels, they almost hang on to you!! Our room is always cleaned spotlessly twice a day. The Italian restaurant serves one of the best steaks I have ever tasted and you cannot stay at the Shangri-La without eating the buffet in Heat. Another advantage of Shang EDSA is that it's directly connected to Shangri-La Plaza (a mall) so there is a good choice of ""normal priced"" restaurants and cafe's to choosed from in there too. The only disadvantage with this hotel is that it can sometimes take a while to get to but that's only because of the famously horrendouds Manila traffic!! I would always recommend this hotel to anyone going to stay in Manila.",Food:Location:Value for money

However, I stayed in the Horizon Club wing and it was just amazing. The entire staff was super friendly and helpful, especially those working in the Horizon Lounge.

"What I love about the Edsa Shangri-la is the ambience of holiday that it creates. I've spent a week in total at the Edsa Shangri-la this year and they never fail to amaze me. The rooms are gorgeous, the lobby as well as the shops inside. Probably one improvement point is the basement space leading to the parking. My point of view is - the colors are off and the paintings should be replaced. Also, the parking - i see it as small. The gym needs some refurbishing and the lobby waiting area needs a facelift.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"it has been 4 years since i made a negative review about this hotel , and it was only last year until now that we used to frequent the hotel for weekend stays ( the condo unit that we own fronting the hotel and connecting to the mall was now under a leasing/rental agreement for a year ) , and i would claim that much has improved since that time , ..i liked the garden wing room that i booked for my family , airconditioning was very good , lighting and fixtures much complete , i like the piped in sound in the bathroom from the huge lcd television and the very comfortable beds ..even though the bath and shower tub are not separate ,just fine with me. they have a sofa which can be actually converted into a pull out bed...reservation that i had was handled out smoothly this time... a connecting bridgeway comprising of elevator and an escalator to the shangrila mall was actually a nice touch ( how about a bridge way to the sm megamall ?) , many shops and several high end restaurants can be found in the hotel , and there was even a cozy bookstore / mini coffeeshop can be found in the ground floor ... there was an abundance of personnel , and most of them are friendly , .. maybe making elevators accesible by card keys would be much better in terms of security... and lastly, 2 things that i like about this hotel aside from the location and its staff ...

"I've used this hotel on other occasions as well as it is conveniently located to the business district I need to visit. It always amazes me how many employees the hotel has: from about 20 staff outside, a lobby filled with hostesses, door openers, lift attendants, etc. etc. and they all are very friendly and professional. full marks to the staff and the people who train them.

This is a huge hotel, and it is always very busy. Many (many!) restaurants, some sit-down, some buffet style, all with quality food. Well equipped, large fitness centre with dedicated staff.

So why the average rating? Well, first of all, this hotel is expensive, you easily pay PHP9000 a night (around US$215). For that amount, you should expect the best there is in Asia. But the rooms are seriously outdated and disappointing!Your room is where (as a business traveller) you would spend most of your time. If you enter your room, it looks like you are stepping back in time to arrive in the late 80-ties.

Seriously, an old mid-size, non-interactive CRT television in a top-class hotel in 2012? A small kettle with some instant coffee? A desk phone from the 80-ties with such poor quality that conference calls are all but impossible? A shower in your bath which doesn't even reach shoulder level so you need to kneel to wash your hair? Free paper but I would expect the FT and not some local paper.

I understood that they are renovating (parts) of the hotel. I really hope they put in place what many (US/European) hotels already put in place: dedicated showers.(I have *never* met anyone who takes a bath in those hotels) Large LCD TV set with interactivity (movies or radio and/or online account info). Modern phone. A programmable alarm clock. Fresh new carpets in neutral colours (why do they always pick purple?) Maybe put some interesting artwork on the walls?

I hope next year all is better, or I will move to the nearby Crowne Plaza",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money
"...I wrote a review on this hotel last year, and I sung praises about it then!

As always the hotel facilities are amazing! Beautiful features and scents really compliment the brands ethos. However, on this occasion, service was a little slop. When I got out of my cab, nobody really helped me with my luggage. I carried a 75 ltr back pack, which is almost the size of a teenager! Clearly they noticed the bag but nobody for concierge came to greet me or offer any assistance. It was only until I got to the reception when I placed my backpack down did someone from concierge come and assist me. Check in was smooth and the lovely receptionist was polite and quick.

The room was beautiful and clean. I checked in with a group of lads and therefore got a twin room and an extra bed. I met some relatives for dinner that night who were staying in the same hotel. When I got back to my room, someone had turned down our beds and placed the slippers and matts appropriately next to the foot of our beds: nice touch Shang! :)

Again, I was disappointed with service at breakfast. The boys and myself, three of us, went down to the all you can eat buffet at Heat (which is amazeballs!). I requested that my relatives be seated with us as we would all dine together. The boys and I ordered our teas and coffees and go started on the buffet. When my relatives did join us we were side-lined by the staff. They're coffee orders were brought straight away and fresh fruit/food were placed at their end of the table. My Godfather had to remind the waiter about our tea n coffee orders. I felt that the waiter/esses paid more attention to the VIPs (my relatives) than my group. I didn't take it personally, but it was a bit embarrassing to have to constantly ask for top ups when my relatives had a constant flow of OJ and coffee without any request.

Having said that... the rest of our stay, albeit short, was okay and check out was quick. The pool was great and the ambience around it is so nice. Just remember that the hotel is situated next to busy roads and a construction site of some kind of mall or hotel, so don't expect to get peaceful laze by the pool...

P.s. if you can, take away as many of the toilet amenities as you can, no not the toilet seat, but the lotions, bath gel and soap... they smell great!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

"Oh my gosh - what a wonderful hotel. My husband and I travelled to Manila to attend a wedding and the Edsa Shangri-la was recommended by the groom as being close to the church and to the wedding reception venue which in Manila traffic seems to be very important,

We were greeted by the Edsa Shangri-la representative at the airport, despite our flight being over an hour late arriving. Our transport was there waiting for us. On arrival at the hotel we were met by a member of the reception staff who had all our details to hand and took us straight to our assigned room and we were checked in there. From the doormen to the porters to the lovely ladies who call the lifts for you we were greeted with large smiles. it was a really nice experience,

The room was large and spacious and well equipped with everything we needed. The bed was huge and so comfortable having spent the last week in mainland China sleeping on rock hard mattresses.

We did not eat at any of the restaurants in the hotel as the Edsa Shangri-la is connected to two of the largest shopping malls in South East Asia. I did however attend the inhouse hairdresser and beauty salon to prepare for the wedding we were attending. The service here was excellent but I would recommend that the hotel invest some money in refurbishment of this area. It was a disappointment which was a letdown from the overall look of the hotel.

Security at the hotel and in the connecting malls is very tight so if you are a nervous traveller you will either feel safe with the obvious presence of the security or even more nervous as all the security (even in individual shops in the malls) are carrying rifles and handguns.

If we were to travel to Manila again, I would definitely book Edsa Shangri-la",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

No matter what request I had they handled quickly and to my satisfaction. Everytime I walked the halls or into the hotel I was greated with great enthuisasm. I honestly felt like a celebrity while I was there, it was a bit hard to come back to the US!

Last thing to say is the buffet is amazing. It has every type of food that you can imagine.

I was kept safe and dry. I checked in on a lean month but the hotel took advantage of the influx of stranded guests that hotel rates suddenly shoot up. I know that this is a business strategy but the hotel should not take advantage of disasters. Rates for lean months should remain as such. Shangrila is truly pricey and is meant to be enjoyed by those who are willing to pay a little more for paradise.

"I used to stay in Makati when in Manila (Shangri-La and MO) and this was a first stay back in town after a long few years away from the country – staying close to our new office.

Overall, this is a puzzling hotel experience for me – the chain is usually very good, this particular property has some great assets but I experienced two very odd service failures which somewhat suggest that there are fundamental servicing issues at play.

The positives first – the staff couldn’t be nicer and the breakfast is really superb. So for these two items I may consider staying there again and hoping things would have otherwise improved.

On to the less positive aspects. Firstly upon check-in I asked, twice for the staff to confirm that the room I was assigned didn’t have a connecting door (always noisy)… he stated this was indeed the case. First thing I saw when walking in the room… a connecting door.

As I was rushing to go to a client meeting, left it with the manager on duty and when I returned was changed to another, better room. Oddly however, no card or service recovery items whatsoever. Inexplicable in such a hotel. As an aside, bathroom was pretty poorly cleaned – glass shower door had huge water marks and large finger smudges on top – not great at all.

Secondly on day 2, I ordered 5 items for dinner from in-room dining… there were issues with 4 of these items, including missing elements to two of the dishes… again utterly baffling to see such endemic failures on a simple, on-menu selection.

As I was wheeling out the servicing table, the in-room dinning duty manager and a chef turned up to apologize – that was a pretty good way to close the situation but overall, left me with an empty stomach. Not good.

Overall, this is a good property but sadly there are such fundamental issues with the actual service delivery – that should be a point of focus moving forward.

One final point, linked to the group itself – the loyalty program makes no sense whatsoever – zero recognition and it seems an afterthought when compared to others… could do much better there.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"I stayed here for 7 night in mid-July on business, and paid about $146 per night including taxes, breakfast, and wi-fi. Overall, I would give this hotel very high marks for service and the quality of the breakfast. It's also conveniently located for those who like to shop, with the upscale ""Shangri-La Plaza Mall"" and the mid-range ""Megamall"" within easy walking distance. The lobby and pool area are impressive and immaculately maintained, and the breakfast is one of the most expansive I have encountered -- an abundance of fresh pastries, fresh fruits, stations where various Asian delights, eggs, pancakes, etc. can be made fresh, and helpful staff. I stayed in the ""Garden Wing,"" whose rooms have yet to be renovated (the ""Tower Wing"" apparently is where the renovated rooms are). The room was smaller than what I expected for a Shangri-La, and had dated decor and a CRT TV, but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom was big enough and well-lit with a deep tub-shower combination. Wi-fi in the room worked reasonably well, although I experienced some very slow times undoubtedly due to the ISP and not the fault of the hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

The staff from the door girls to the valet service and management were most obliging and courteous and what they don't know about 'customer service' is not worth knowing!! Particularly Jen and Jackie in the Horizon Club...boy if I could bottle their skills I would be a very wealthy man!!

I loved that they added a cook-on-demand tapa (marinated beef, perhaps angus) and tocino (sweet-glazed pork) station. Check-out was a breeze. Shangri-la still continues to lead the hotels in the metro.

I love that the hotel is near everything. It's walking distance to 3 malls and a church. Near office buildings. a 10-20 minute cab-ride from a hospital.

"If you stayed @ Makati, then this place would be a disappointment. Somehow the shangri-la seems to be ignoring this place. The hotel location is not too good unless you've business in Luzon area or if you are traveling with family and looking for slightly cheaper option this is a good choice.

Hotel rooms are of acceptable quality but certainly need an upgrade. You can see the bathrooms in not so good condition and I had a faulty sink and they changed my room. Sleep quality is good but again, the aircon needs some touchups as I woke-up with pretty dry skin/face.

The Hotel is right next to one of the largest shopping mall in Philippines. So if you are going with your family, I'm sure they'd love it.

Our room was located in the Garden wing, which is away from the hustle and bustle of the a tower wing. The room had exclusive access to the Spa, so once you're done with the treatment then you can avoid having to go through the lobby. The room itself was very comfortable and was probably upgraded fairly recently. After the relaxing spa treatment we decided to order in room dining, service was very prompt and courteous, as expected from a Shangrila-La!

When comparing to the Makati Shangri-La I would say the Edsa has equal common areas and a superior pool area with a resort like feel. The Makati fitness center is a little nicier than Edsa, however Edsa was fine. Rooms at Makati are more modern, however my room at the Edsa was definitely up to Shangri-La standard.

I was working late evening hours while in Manila and a nice perk of both hotels is the late night bar/room service in the lobby area even when it appears visibly closed.

"I have made semi-annual business trips to Manila since 2003 and
have stayed in half a dozen different hotels around Mandaluyong, Pasig
and Makati. The Edsa Shangri-La hotel is one of the better choices if
visiting the Ortigas, Pasig or Mandaluyong City areas, although I would not call it a resort.

In general, the security is reliable, the staff is friendly and welcoming, and the hotel is clean and well-maintained at the Edsa Shangri-La. There is a large outdoor pool and a well-equipped fitness center which gets crowded during peak hours, but does include treadmills, free
weights and various fitness machines.

The breakfast buffet offers a very impressive mix of Asian and Western foods including made-to-order eggs/omelets, sliced meats, fresh fruits, juices, coffee & teas, etc - just about anything you could want. I stayed in a standard room with a King bed, which included a well-appointed restroom, good air conditioning and adequate desk and closet space.

When checking in, I informed the front desk that I would be working nights and sleeping days; I was provided an 8th floor room on the West side of the main building, opposite the pool and away from the elevators. This location was fine for my trip; although I would
recommend if you have similar sleeping needs, in addition to hanging the privacy sign on your door that you call the front desk and ask them to block your calls before retiring. Otherwise, housekeeping or other staff members may call while you are sleeping in an attempt to
schedule service. Throughout all of my hotel experiences in Manila this has been an ongoing issue; it would seem the local hotels would have better methods for accommodating the many guests working international business hours, however the industry in general doesn’t
seem to recognize the circumstances.

One other minor gripe: twice during my 7-night stay, the Edsa Shangri-La was unable to provide hotel cab service; one of these occurrences was for the outbound trip to the airport. One should call ahead to ensure availability of hotel cabs. In fairness to the staff, a public taxi was quickly obtained on each of these occasions.

Depending on what type of discount may be available to you, the rates can trend towards the high side, but the breakfast buffet helps offset the room rate. Overall though, the Edsa Shangri-La offers security, cleanliness, and good sleeping conditions. In all probability I will
return to the Edsa Shangri-La during my next stay in Ortigas.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Sent to the Manila on work assignment that began as a 20 day stay and ended up being being a 55 day working vacation!
The hotel car was quick and efficicent OR you have the option of just exiting baggage claim walking across the street to the Edsa transportation center and getting a car just as quickly. They quickly dispatch a car, allow you free WI-FI service while you wait and bottle water to cool off.
Arrival at the hotel was flawless and check -in took less than 10 minutes before I was wisked away to my room in the Garden Wing of the hotel. Previously, I stayed on the other side but the Garden Wing was quiet elegance at it's best. The Garden Wing of the hotel is like being disconnected from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the hotel which can get hectic and noisy. (I was there during Valentine's Day and Chinese New Year). I preferred walking around the pool area to get to the Garden Wing versus walking through the hotel. The pool I found to be quiet small compared to the size of the hotel but the pool was not why I was there. The room staff made of point of asking and memorizing the guest and what they like (they keep a file on long term guest, likes, dislikes, preferences) and they made certain to cater to those preferences.
Restaurants and food is in over abundance and The Heat restaurant turned out to be my favorite with too many choices to even be seen all at once. Since I am not a breakfast person, in all the time I stayed at the hotel I only ate breakfast once in the restaurant. I ordered room service, but the food was more than enough for two people versus one.
After working all possible shifts I enjoyed coming back to the hotel to someone greeting me by name and opening the lift for me.

The hotel is top notch and you pay for what you get (convenience of location, surrounded by The MegaMall, connnected to The Shangri-la Mall ""The Shang"", St. Francis Mall, Green Hills Mall, the subway, taxi's galore and most anything else you could imagine). It is very pricey but worth it. HOWEVER, there are advance booking that gives you that same room that I had at a 60% discount. You have to do your homework!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La on a business trip. The hotel was wonderful from the decor to the staff. The pool area was an oasis in a bustling city. When I left, I felt like I had not touched a door handle or elevator button in 2 weeks as there was always a smiling staff member to do it for me. The room was large and well appointed(there were even blackout curtains, which were a big plus as I was working overnight). I had a room overlooking the street on the 17th floor and encountered no street noise. If you are a light sleeper, you may want to request a room on one of the higher floors .The room attendant(s) was very accommodating and did an excellent job. Every staff member I encountered was polite and concerned with my satisfaction. If you wallet permits(or the company is paying), I highly recommend a visit to the Edsa Shangri-La.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
"Stayed here for 3 nights during a whirlwind business trip thru Asia. With a late night arrival, easy transfer from the airport, greeted at the door and taken immediately to my room for in-room check-in. Great way to arrive during a hectic trip.
Room was clean, well maintained, and very comfortable. I really appreciated the fresh fruit every day. Hotel itself is very peaceful and never any noise in the hallways, etc.
Staff was always gracious and helpful..
Buffet Breakfast at Heat had food for every taste, all fresh and well presented.
I did have the opportunity to spend some time at the pool and the service there was excellent as well. After the first day, the staff remembered my name, my drink of choice (coke light) and that I preferred to be in the shade.
Would love to spend some time here on a vacation, instead of for work ;)",Food:Staff
"I just had a overnight stay and I came away very impressed with the hotel. It's classy in its design and also its service. Arguably a bit too much service as there is a young lady in front of the lifts ensuring that I save a few seconds.

The buffet spread is excellent, even by Asian standards. I think one can have 4 or 5 breakfasts and not feel jaded. There is that much variety.

The room is well designed. I was just thinking the other day about how the sink should have a ledge so that some stuff can be kept there dry. And there it was--a glass ledge above the sink exactly for that purpose.

I tried the spa and it is very professionally done. No hanky panky here.

The hotel is next to a shopping mall owned by the same owners. At this time of writing, it is rather messy as some parts are under renovation.

The only downside is the price. Depending on what you compare with, it is two to three times the next reasonable place.

I suppose this means that if you can afford it, you should spring for it.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food

Buffet breakfast was great! So many dishes to choose from -- ""nakakalula"", haha. One of the chefs happens to be a former classmate of mine, she was attending to us every now and then.

"I've stayed in a few hotels all over the Philippines and to be honest none of them really met expectations till I stayed at the EDSA Shangri-la!

Stayed here for 3 nights in a standard room, it was booked under a corporate rate so it was very good value at that.

Service is extraordinary here (except for 1 instance details later) from the second you step out of the car and into the driveway you are welcomed by staff and your luggage etc is taken care for you. You are pleasantly greeted by hotel staff as you enter the door, go up in the lifts. It actually feels like a different world once you are inside the hotel.

The room itself was standard not extraordinary but clean and I think well maintained. The hallways smelled nice was well.

The buffet breakfast was HUGE! Yet it was of good quality and not just a mish mash of food. Staff at the buffet were helpful and friendly including the chefs! When I went to the juice bar and they saw that I was holding a plate then 2 glasses of juice the juiceman would actually offer to help you carry the glasses to your table.

The pool was of good size, clean and if kids were being too rowdy the lifeguard would actually tell them off!

The spa was exquisitely built but to be honest a bit too pricey. My husband and I got a massage though it was nice it wasn't worth the money! Our bill from Chi Spa was actually more than what our room bill was!

One area that the Shangri-la could improve on is the service at the lobby bar/dining area. We had lunch there and the waitresses were hard to catch! At one point they were just chatting at the front and not looking around if any of the guests needed anything. When we finally caught the eye of one of the staff who was serving another table she gave as the ""wait a minute"" hand gesture but never came. When asked later why she never came to help us she replied ""Oh because there are other guests in the hotel which needed my help"" Ummmm are we not guests as well? We complained to the manager on duty- she gave us a complimentary dessert but it would have been better if she took our feedback on board .To be fair the waitress approached us as we were leaving to apologise for the setback.

Overall this hotel is excellent and would definitely stay here again. We also asked our luggage to be stored here for about 5 days as we were going off to a remote island and the bell boys were happy to take it and efficiently tagged it.

I'm going back to stay here in May 2012 and I cannot wait!",Staff:Food:Value for money
"I stayed here for 3 weeks (business) and loved it. The ultimate in luxury, I felt like a film star! This is a TRUE 5 star hotel, although huge the staff greeted by name (how they do that in a hotel this size is beyond me) The room was huge, with lovely bedding (feather duvet and pillows so I felt at home) and the room guy, well he was great. Fresh fruit every day, he quickly realised I didnt like oranges - cos I left them, and made sure he left me fruit I did like. Great stuff!

The breakfast is a feast, more like a dinner really - I loved the garlic rice... funny think to eat for breakfast I know but I just pretty much tried everything.

The food overall was excellent, plenty of choice and great service.

The pool is lovely, just a little oasis in this manic city. The hotel is well situated being just across the road from the malls, so its safe to go alone (( was abit worried about this being a solo female but it was fine)

"Stayed for three nights during a recent business trip visiting a nearby company _first time in Manila_. Was warmly received at a lounge at the airport, while I waited for 5 minutes until a brand new car arrived to take me through the city's crazy traffic. It took good 45 minutes to get to the hotel, which were made easier as there was wifi in the car, a refreshing towel and water. On arrival, I was led straight away to my room for an express check-in _no counters or queues_ and in no time I was at large. Comfortable room, very clean, huge bed, great mattress. Old TV, which I personally didn't care about. The hotel is located just across the Shangri-La Mall, connected through a bridge so you don't need to actually cross the street to get to it. Very good place for shopping _most relevant brand stores seem to be there and a lot of good dining options too_. Breakfast at Heat Restaurant is by itself worth staying at this hotel. Chinese station, with hot steamed dumplings, buns and a few further options, Japanese station serving sushi, Pilipino snacks and meals, Malay-Indian station with different options of dhal, rice, curries, chutnes, papadums and roti canai, French pastries, chesse and cold meats, fresh fruit, eggs and bacon as you may get in the US, salads, cereals, nuts... you name it. I'm certainly failing to mention half of the options you have. You may stay there for a month and still have new options to taste. The gym is very well equipped and definitely worth visiting, specially after indulging over too big a breakfast and, unless you have an iron will, eating more throughout your day, as in Manila it seems there's countless places where you'll be tempted to try delicious food, with local stuff being by far the best, exotic mixture of Asian and Spanish influences. There's a generously sized swimming pool with an on-duty life saver and a towel clerk that just wouldn't allow you to go all the way to return your used towels, as soon as you'd start walking towards him he'd hurry to meet you at least half way. People greeting and smiling at you when they open doors or call the elevator for you are every minute's standard. While this might be unnecessary _I'm more than used to opening doors myself when I need to_ having people smile at you all the time and help you with every detail, brings about a positive atmosphere and a sense of well being. Alas, the reservations manager failed to timely inform the front desk that my company was getting my bill, so I had to go twice to the check-out counter and send a couple of texts to get it sorted out. The only negative point to an overall superb experience, still I sincerely recommend staying here.

Kids had a grand time in the pool, which was manned by attentive, polite and professional lifeguards. The four pools were enough to ensure that it wasn't overly crowded on a sultry hot Manila summer day. Ordered chips (oops, fries) which arrived hot and tasty, although a little slow.
Breakfast at Heat was magnificent. Highlight was the freshly cooked beef tapa at the Tapsilog station. You guys should really try this! Thin sliced seasoned beef paired with over easy eggs on garlic rice. I can hear my cardiologist throwing a fit...
Requested for a 2PM checkout which was granted immediately.

Reserved a room in the Garden Wing and requested for a rollaway bed. They provided a pull-out sofa bed. Although not as big as I expected (converted only into a single), it served the purpose. Garden Wing had its own small reception desk which was quite convenient since there is always a queue and the Tower Wing (main) one.

The hotel staff are great and enjoyed my stay on the Horizon Club Floor room in the Garden Tower. If you're concerned about security this is your hotel. Security starts as you drive onto the complex and is at every entrance to the hotel, mall and residential towers.

The restaurants are good and there are other choices at the Shangri-La Mall. The Mega Mall is close by and a nice grouping of restaurants are a few blocks away. Internet access is by far the best.

"I am always at the Edsa Shang for the health club and the restaurants. For the past year, it has quite deteriorated in terms of service. I think cost cutting is to blame since the arrival of the new Singaporean General Manager.
The restaurants are still full of people but i have noticed that the food and service are not what it used to be.
Service is erratic. The old favorite waiters are no longer there and the new ones still need training. Part of a hotel experience is sometimes the familiarity that the team has with the guest, what one likes to eat and where one likes to be seated. gone gone gone.
Even the friendly guards have been replaced. Ah yes, even the sniff dogs are new.
While it remains ok, i miss the way Shang Edsa was run before by the French GM then. It was simple, compassionate but heartfelt service....now it feels like a business inn.",Staff:Food

"I stayed in this hotel in the summer of 2007 and every summer until 2010. During our first stay, my wife and I wanted to go on vacation but didn't have the time because of work and we only had one day to spare. So we decided to spend the night at the Edsa shangril-la because of their nice pool. I realized, when I was waiting in line to check in, that the edsa shang is almost everybody's favorite hotel for the summer. I got a standard room, nothing fancy, but when I got to the room it was wonderful. The bathroom, the bed, everything about it was amazingly clean and in working order. Though some of the furnishings were kinda worn out, but it didnt bother me and had no effect on my stay. The pool was nice, even when there were so many people especially kids. the pool staff made sure we had fresh towels and we managed to squeeze some time for picture-taking around the garden, which was truly awesome.
Their restaurant, Heat, was and still is known to be the best hotel buffet in the land. No other hotel restaurant beats the buffet of Edsa Shangrila. It has been awarded many times and i am happy they still live up to their awards, perhaps even deserving more. Compared to her sister in makati, Edsa Shangrila's hospitality, security and total customer satisfaction is at an all time high, without reports of anyone dying in the hotel or getting robbed. I would highly recommend this hotel to any traveler, domestic and foreign. that's why we always stay there at least one night every summer until 2010.

"If your business is not in Makati, but more central/northern NCR, this is a good location, right off EDSA. It is also near malls, so it's easy to pick-up any last-minute items you may have forgotten to pack.

HEAT Restaurant offers a wonderful variety, for breakfast you can have a ""world tour"" of food options!

The spa did cancel my massage; I made reservation evening before for 7am, they called me at 6.40am saying ""too many walk-ins, can we move your appointment to later?"" When I told them ""No, just cancel my appointment"" they called me back at 7.15am ""Are you coming?"" So there was a lack of understanding there, and a bit frustrating that walk-ins are more important than those that make reservations. Guess if you're reading this, try walking-in for a massage, may have better luck than I did! ;-)

"Stayed in Edsa Shangrila once but have been to their restaurants a couple of times already. The room rates (and restaurant prices) are not cheap but the facilities and service are just top notch.

Location - This is a perfect option if you need to be near Manila's second Commercial Business District - Ortigas Center, or if you plan to go to Manila and do not need to stay in the Makati Commercial Business district which is about 30 minutes cab ride away. Otherwise, there is a Makati Shangrila in the Makati CBD and the Traders Hotel in Manila. Location is excellent as you are just a short walk away from the CBD. There are 3 big malls around the hotel - the big SM Megamall with lots of shopping, eating and entertainment options just beside, Shangrila Mall is just behind the hotel also offering good choices. There is also the smaller ""Podium"" which also offers good restaurants, just behind SM Megamall. Further down the road is another big Mall - Robinsons. If you are after bargain shopping, the Greenhills shopping center is just a 10 minute cab ride away. Public transport is very much accessible with a lot of taxi cabs going around. There are cues for taxi at the back entrance of the hotel, or you can go to the Shangrila Mall or SM Megamall to cue up for a cab. The MRT (light rail) has stations stopping just outside the Shangrila Mall and SM Megamall.

Rooms - Me and my family stayed in the cheaper superior room which was just nice for a five star hotel, nothing extraordinary but still up to par. Everything was clean and spotless, very nice and comfy bed. High speed internet access was complimentary. Colleauges have stayed at the slightly higher priced garden rooms under the ""Horizon Club"" where you have a separate and smooth check in, exclusive access to the horizon club where you get free flowing beverages and cocktails as well as access to meeting rooms at the horizon lounge - highly recommended.

Restaurants - The room came with complimentary buffet breakfast at their Heat restaurant at the ground floor. Breafast, Lunch and Dinner at this restaurant was just great but not cheap with a very good selection. I've tried the 3 other restaurants in the hotel and they were also very good, but if you want to enjoy good food without spending too much - go to the malls which offer a big selection of different cuisines. For drinks and entertainment, there is the ""Metrowalk"" which has bars, clubs, restaurants as well as live bands every night.

The hotel can get crowded due to a lot of events - weddings, parties, conventions, business and political meetings, so expect the lobby to be full of people going around. As with most establishments in the Philippines, security is quite tight with K-9 and security personnel checking visitors.

It's an excellent five star hotel, easily ranking the very top of all the hotels we've visited in Manila. My wife and I were pampered when we first arrived. We reserved a city view room in the Horizon club rooms. We had personalized express check in and free valet parking. When got to our room, we were treated with fruits and minutes later our luggage arrived.

We loved our room's decor, the abundance of face, hand, and shower towels, L'Occitane bath products, an iron, a large desk, and sofa that turns into a bed. Our bed was very comfy and we slept well without any problems concerning noise or any disturbance.

We were impressed with the additional amenities that the were exclusive for Horizon club's personalized guest care. For example, the Express check-in and check out made our arrival and check out extremely speedy, loved the complimentary cocktails, the free broadband Internet both WI-FI or Ethernet was a surprise, and the club's free snacks and free buffet breakfast at the 14th floor was excellent

"Located right smack in the shopping mall capital of the Philppines, the Edsa Shangri-La which is often used as a venue for various conventions can easily change the agenda of your business trip.

We stayed at the Chi rooms located in the new wing - the garden wing. The rooms, in terms of amenities and size, are standard for a five star hotel. Other posters have commented that the rooms in the old wing need updating however IMO, the new rooms in the garden wing surprisingly did not give me an impression that they were ... new. They were just nothing impressive for a new room, I guess. Staying in the garden wing however, will give you quick access to the spa, the pool and the bridge to Shangri-la Plaza Mall. The tower wing is not that far away to make a substantial difference to access the previously mentioned though. SM Megamall is within walking distance too from this hotel. Other shopping malls (Robinson's, Podium, Greenhills) are a short ride away. A plus for us was that the sofa seat in our room is actually a pull-out bed. I don't really know if the hotel will charge for it if they set it up but since there was an extra pillow and blanket in the closet, we helped ourselves. :-). The best thing about the room -- free wifi access and it's wicked fast.

The Heat, where you have your buffet breakfast if you opt for breakfast to come with your stay, never fails to please. They have a large selection offering different cuisines. It will be impossible if there wasn't at least something here that will please you even if you are the pickiest eater on Earth. I did notice that the Chinese dimsum (esp the Hakaw) wasn't as good as the last time I've dined there though. We were here during the first week of December and breakfast was really busy. By 9AM, a line was forming outside for you to get a table. Do come early for breakfast if you notice that the hotel is somewhat busy. I do not particularly like how they sit couples or singles. In order to maximize space, they put tables for two an inch apart in one long row in some parts of the restaurant.

The hotel has a large pool with 2 small kiddie pools. One kiddie pool even has a slide. The spa here is recommended by many and so are the gym facilities but I did not bother to check it out.

Service was good. Check in and check out were quick even during a busy time for the hotel. Guests billeted at the garden wing can check in or out at a satellite counter by the elevator.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This is a crazy nice hotel. The lobby is impressive, there are a bajillion employees, I don't think I opened up a door once while there...several restaurants to choose from, big pool, spa, shops...really nice.

Someone recommended I book an executive room in the garden wing. I booked an executive suite instead, only because I noticed the difference between the exec and exec suite was marginal, less the $20 US. The executive suite is ridiculous...really big, new, beautiful, one of the nicer rooms I've stayed in anywhere. I ended up needing to add an extra night to my stay, but the room I was in was booked, so I had to move to an plain old executive room. Perhaps if I didn't stay in the awesome executive suite I would have been impressed by this room, but I did not, so I felt a bit of a let down. It's nice too, but pay the extra $20 and get into the suite. It's worth it.

Security in the hotel is very good. Transpostion it easy - they will pick you up at the airport and you can easily get a car to bring you anywhere, for a reasonable price.

If you need to be in Manila this is a super comfortable hotel to stay in. I will stay there again next visit.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The location of this hotel is convenient for my business and as traffic is a major problem in Manila this is an important consideration.

It is also conveniently located to a number of large shopping complex's, this is not so important for me, but spoke to a number of guests who bring their wives to this hotel just so they can go shopping, hair dressers, spa's etc., in any event quite nice to be able to walk in relative air-conditioned comfort away from the hotel and get a snack etc.

The hotel is well presented and maintained although I feel the carpets and wall coverings in rooms and corridors are probably in need of replacement. The staff are helpful and well trained. Due to sudden change of travel plans I left laundry at the hotel un collected....six months later it was there, freshly laundered again and delivered to my room minutes after check in.

I particularly like the Italian restaurant Paparazzi, where I have had consistently good food, in fact the best food I have tasted in Manila and the choice of wines is also excellent.

The price of the hotel ( and indeed the restaurant ) is not cheap, but the service is good so on balance would say it represents value.

Everything worked, bed was comfortable, internet speed reasonable, security seems good, if the decor of rooms and corridors was a little bit ""Fresher"" I would not hesitate to give this a 5 star.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"If you have tried 5 star hotels in Europe - try this! Service is fanfuc....tantic! Upgrade yourself so you have access to their business lounge - this gives you the possibility to have breakfast there, afternoon tea, and free drinks plus snack in the evening. Overall GREAT!",Food:Value for money
"Stayed at the hotel for a night during a business trip with a number of colleagues. Airport transfer office was easy to locate and while it took the staff a couple of minutes to organize, they got a transit van ready and rushing towards the hotel in town. Check-in was done at the Horizon Lounge and was a quick. Was a given a club room on the 13th floor which unfortunately was next to the elevators so my sleep ended when the elevator traffic started at around 6am.

The room was large and comfortable, the toilet amenities and supplies were faultless and everything worked. The free broadband was fast and reliable.

Had breakfast at the lounge and food selection was generally okay. If you want more choices then the hotel restaurant HEAT would be a better choice. A couple of my colleagues ordered noddle soup which was not on the lounge menu so it had to be sent up from HEAT which took half an hour. Staff were very friendly and helpful.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Attended a course held at Edsa Shangri-La . My first time in Manila. Transfers were arranged by the hotel and the transfer office was easily located at the airport. It was pleasant having happy smiling staff to greet us when we arrived and check in was efficient.
Rooms: Whilst not entirely big, was dated. I did not expect a small ‘tube” TV for a 5 star property however it was not a problem. The bed was comfortable and there was a good selection of pillows. The bathroom/toilet was also dated but more importantly it was clean. A good selection of toiletries was provided .
The air-conditioning was a tad noisy but did not pose a problem. The room was well lit which was much appreciated as I hate dim lighting so often found in “modern” hotels. The room was comfortably bright with light switches easily accessible.
The complimentary bottles of water supplied daily were also appreciated together with the fresh fruit provided.
Food services: The buffet breakfast and lunch at the Heat restaurant was the highlight! The selection was great perhaps too much but I enjoyed the meals there every day. I also had the opportunity of trying out the Italian, Chinese and Japanese restaurant. The food was great but the price was really up there as well! I would say the Chinese restaurant was the winner this trip with its innovative and extremely tasty dishes.
Other amenities: the gym was large and well equipped with modern equipment. The pool was of a decent size. Poolside staff was friendly and courteous and the late closing time was good. It was a surprise to find out that the gym/sports center also provided a massage service which was considerably cheaper than the services provided at the “Chi” spa. Whilst the treatment rooms were basic, there were no complaints with the massage provided by the masseuse. The “Chi” spa was as expected within a 5 star property. It was well appointed with many private rooms where one can enjoy the peaceful surrounds and succumb to the pampering provided.
The meeting facilities: I believe this was a letdown or more an afterthought for this hotel. The meeting room was small and stuffy. It was noisy and was not well attended by staff causing the meeting organizers to work out light switches audio visual equipment by themselves. Each participant was provided with a glass of water (replenished during breaks) and we can count the number of “lollies” provided in one hand placed on each desk. Too bad if you needed to have more water during the meeting. The coffee/tea breaks were self help which I thought could have been better especially when there were so many staff ‘floating’ around the hotel.
The lobby lounge was spacious and having a quartet play soft background music was much better than having amplified performances where having a decent conversation would be difficult.
Overall the staff was efficient and friendly and somehow a smiling face seems to diffuse any problems away.
Location: whist we did not have much time to explore Manila, the hotel was close to 2 big shopping Malls which was very convenient.
Highlights for this hotel to me were the friendly and constantly smiling staff, the food at the Chinese and Heat restaurant.
Would I come back again? I think if not for the course being held here again and the cost paid to stay at this hotel, I would be interested in trying other properties. It was a comfortable and pleasant stay but I would not class it as memorable.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I nominate this property as first-priority for an upgrade. I knew that this was quite an old hotel, and obviously did not know that the management did not mind it being that way. In the executive room where I stayed (Horizon Garden Room), the hotel really did show its age --- fading carpets, squeeky cabinet handles, scratched working desks, old linens, and greyish towels. To be fair, the room was as clean as it could get, but it was obvious it had seen better days back in the 1990s.

Prices for 5-star hotels in Manila are notoriously high, but paying about USD280 nett (inclusive of lounge access and internet) for such an ill maintained hotel felt like a rip-off. They made it seem though that I was getting more than my money's worth --- but did not do their convincing too well, which made knowing that you were being ripped off worse.

The property is indeed a huge one, and the lobby can feel like a market with people milling around. I assume they were waiting for car pick-ups (everyone has chauffers in Manila, apparently), although it did feel like people were just that --- milling around. The ground floor has a gym that is open to non-guests, so there are folks in their exercise attire walking in and out. Not my version of Shangri-La.

The staff at the executive lounge were quite pleasant, but I had one experience with one staff that I could only describe as weird/off-putting. I needed to urgently scan documents in the Lounge on the 14th floor, and asked for assistance from one of the lounge staff. We had problems with scanning, and when I pointed out what I thought was doing wrong, she irritatedly reasoned out that she was doing the right thing. It felt like an angel showing fangs --- she raised her voice slightly, making it obvious enough that she was irritated, but just not high enough not to be overtly rude. Checking out never felt so good after that.

Good things here:
1. Internet was fast enough
2. Heat restaurant buffet was very good and reasonably priced.
3. Staff as pleasant as you can expect from a Philippine five-star hotel -- except of course, the bad experience at the lounge",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Service in hotel was excellent, very quick and attentive. Even when we ordered trolleys to take our luggage downstairs, they didn't knock our door because we had ""privacy please"" sign.
There are a lot of good toiletries in the hotel room, very comfortable to stay there, a lot of pillows, complimentary water every day, a lot of cable channels.

Breakfast buffet in ""HEAT"" is amazing and includes everything you ever can wish like dimsums, sushi, pancakes, waffles, crepes, french toasts, fruits, muesli, juices, yogurts, a lot of different breads, donuts, croissants, and so much more..

Upstairs in Chinese restaurant ""Summer Palace"" worth eating.. everything is very high quality and simply delicious.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We have stayed at this hotel twice and had a great experience both times. We upgraded to the Horizon Level and enjoyed having the extra amenities with a large lounge area and breakfasts/snacks.

The buffet at HEAT on the first floor was great too. We have never had a bad experience at any buffet at any Shangri-la hotel. There were many food choices that satisfied our whole family including our young children.

We also went to the mall next door quite often. There is a private entrance to the mall which makes it quite convenient.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"One of the best hotel we have stayed in. The service is great, the breakfast was great, the rooms were great. The location was also excellent. Not far is the Megamall and there you have everything. This hotel have everything you need and even more. Of course the price is also high, but worth it.",Location:Food:Staff
"Well, what to say about this hotel ... I would describe it as being ""OK"". Needless to say, the public areas such as the lobby, restaurants and spa are really nice. It sets however expectations for the rest of the hotel - in particular the rooms. And the rooms are a bit on the boring site. Fairly dark, lots of heavy and dark wood, tube-sized television, cabled internet and a safe without a manual (risky to put your stuff in there). Bathroom is also ageing and the days that I would like to shower in a (small) bath tub are definitely gone. In summary: luxury from the outside, average from the inside.",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"I stayed a few times in Manila now and tried the Edsa Shang this time.

Since The Edsa is part of the Shangri-La group, you will be provided with luxury - no shortcomings there.

The hotel itself is nice but not as great as the Shang in Makati. This was expected as the Shang in Makati comes with a considerably higher price tag.

The breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffet were not up to my expectations. The food was just OK but not outstanding and the selection was repeatedly the same every day. Compared to the food at other high-end hotels, I was disspointed.

The location is somewhat boring as there is not much to do within walking distance of the hotel other than visiting the 2 nearby malls. Expect to take taxi's if you want to roam around.

Bottom line: Overall, the Edsa provided for a good and safe stay during my trip and I don't really have any complaints.

I would probably stay at the Edsa again, only if I am able to find a decent deal or promotion. I would not stay there for full price but would rather prefer a different high-end hotel chain.",Food:Location:Value for money
"Business trip and I felt really well looked after. You cannot fault the staff at this hotel and I was taken from my airport transfer straight to my room. It was clean and plenty of room. The staff couldnt do more to help and ensure I had everything I needed for my stay. Loads of places to eat and drink and the gym, pool and tennis courts are even better to work off the food. I was really impressed with my 4 day stay here and will definately stay again when next in Manila. Another plus point was that I felt really safe inside the hotel too and its only a short walk to a shopping centre and bars. Only one down side is that the rooms are a little dated which is a shame as the rest of the hotel is beautiful inside.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"The lobby area of the hotel is very spacious and gorgeous. There were lots of staff members looking fantastic in their turqoise-coloured uniforms always ready and willing to assist with anything. Check-in was efficient and my bags arrived in the room not long after I did.

The pool area is lovely, I made sure I found a few hours to enjoy it. A waiter brought around some skewers of fruit which was a nice touch. Comfy deck chairs, ample towels, etc. My only complaint was that the outside lounge/bar put on some loud 70s-sounding music which destroyed the tranquility of the area - thankfully after about 30 minutes they turned it right down (this was late afternoon and there was no one in the bar - maybe the staff were bored!).

Heat restaurant was very pleasant, had a good selection of vegetarian food, and the prices were reasonable for this calibre of hotel. It was very busy though and I imagine it could get very loud if full (and the service could suffer, they looked a little flustered even when it wasn't quite full).

The health club opened at 5am which was great for people working, and had quite a lot of equipment (weights, machines and cardio equipment). I had no trouble getting onto any equipment during the morning pre-work peak hour.

The hotel is conveniently located next to two shopping malls - the Shangri-La Plaza (lots of designer stuff) and the large Mega Mall which has lots of eating places as well as shops.

Regarding my room - as advised on TripAdvisor reviews I requested a Garden Room and thankfully got one so had a nice view over the pool area. A colleague staying at the same time unfortunately was put in a room next to a helipad though this didn't seem to bother him, maybe he's a heavy sleeper! (I'm not!).

The bed was very comfortable and air-conditioning easy to adjust. Good space for suitcase and clothes, and adequate desk area. I always appreciate having a comfortable armchair, side table and foot stool like there was in this room. The bathroom was functional, the shower is over the bath so could be a problem for people with mobility problems. One gripe regarding the bathroom - there was a pull-out shaving / makeup mirror mounted on the wall next to the basin which is usually very handy, however this one didn't tilt and was mounted at about 5 feet high! My back hurt too much while trying to bend and use it so I gave up.

The room was fairly small but adequate. Gripes about the room are the damp musty smell when I entered the room (which I got used to after about 5 minutes) and the very old CRT TV - bad enough on it's own but also had no ability to connect a laptop or DVD player to it.

All up though I would definitely recommend this hotel for it's service, location, restaurant, health club and lobby - and make sure you request a Garden Room (and don't expect anything too big!).",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed here last December 2010. I arrived a few minutes before the shopping mall nearby would have closed, and I thought that I could breeze through the check-in so that I could buy a local phone card immediately thereafter. But no... check in was not speedy. In any case, the receptionist was very friendly, professional and attentive. What I did not like was that my luggages disappeared from my sight, and they were not in my room when I went up. So, I waited and then the time came for the mall to close. The luggages showed up a few minutes later. Check out was not a repeat of this experience. They kept the luggages within my sight while they called for a taxi. All in all, excellent services. I also liked their restaurant, Heat, where breakfast is served.
What I didn't like: The room was very old and had the associated smell to it. Also, my refrigerator was defective. I needed it to cool several chocolates brought for family and friends. But the room was cooler than the refrigerator. Unfortunately, I forgot to inform the hotel staff. But they should anyway control the conditions in the room regularly.
One more thing: At check-in, I was asked for my calling card - apparently to update my records. But I ended up later with promotional e-mails.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This is the second time I have stayed at the Shangri-La. The last time was in 2009. This time my wife and I were passing through on our way to Samar and stayed two nights in a Garden Room on the value rate. A bit more expensive, but well worth the inclusions it in my opinion.
Everything was just as good as the last time. I will recommend staying at this hotel whenever in Manila.
The Airport pickup & drop off service was excellent and timely.
Checkin / checkout was a breeze. You can ask to be billed in your local currency, so no surprises.
Our room was clean and modern. King size bed was very comfortable.
Free room wifi worked well on my wife's iPad. Skyping the kids back home was no problem.
Buffet breakfast at Heat is still awesome. So much choice and what we had tasted pretty good.

I love the swimming pool location and it's surrounds. A bit of paradise in a concrete jungle, which leads me to my only negative comment which is to do with all the high rise construction going up around the hotel. The hotel is being engulfed by high rise condo's. Soon there will be no city views, so ask for a garden view room. At least you won't be staring directly into someone esle's windows. On the other hand we enjoy the hotel location because it's within easy walking distance of Shangri-la and Mega malls.
And finally the overall service was great. Staff were always courteous and friendly and we always felt secure.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"WE are a California based family who travel quite often to the Philippines and are ""repeaters"" at EDSA Shangri-la. We highly recommend the hotel for family and business trips. Great location means- short taxi ride from the airport, within walking distance are two big malls, great restaurants in the hotel(HEAT, Paparazzi, etc). Rooms, pool, gym, tennis courts- the whole hotel is very clean and tastefully decorated- - this time around big bunch of orchids at the foyer.
Excellent service is what really sets this hotel apart. They aim to please- - That's why we like our ""home away from home- EDSA Shangri-la.""",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"My husband & I spent 10 nights at Edsa Shangrila from Sept. 16th. Arriving close to midnight after a long flight, we were met at the hotel entrance, escorted to the room by Princess and other formalities completed right in our room. We were upgraded to a corner room on the Executive floor which was comfortable and spacious. Breakfast at Heat was the best we've seen in our travels to nearly 50 countries. The variety of food, personal attention by staff were amazing. The staff in every department were courteous, smiling and always ready to assist. Soon they greeted us by name. Riri a Corporate Management trainee made certain that we were comfortable. She even got us a fruit that is normally not in the fruit platter provided in our room. The hotel was just a block away to the Shangrila and SM Mega Malls. Our thanks to the entire staff at Edsa Shanrila for being so accommodating.",Staff:Food
