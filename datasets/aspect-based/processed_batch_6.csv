"Eye catching right?

This will definitely be your home away from home in Cebu!
Been here for couple of days to celebrate my Mom's Birthday. Truly amazing and you'll never go wrong of choosing Shangri-la Mactan, everyone will surely greet you lovely the way how natural they are. From your point of entry, the guards that warmly welcomed us in Cebuano (forgot to get their names), the girl wearing a dress like yellow costume who greeted and assisted us for check in, even bellmans, guest relations and public attendants made us feel the warmness of Cebuanos. We arrived early at the hotel, upon check in? One of the jolliest and very accommodating receptionist who'll give you exceptional service delighted me and my family for assisting us all throughout, that's Bob! Yes! I commend his dedication and I felt how passionate we works. Just a quick tip for the others who'll visit Shangri-la Mactan look for this guy! I'm pleased as well as we enter the room to see a set up of a birthday cake for my Mom! Set up of fruit platter and a welcome letter from their FOM. Thanks giving us a delightful stay! Cheers! All staff were commendable some of them are: receptionists Nareen and Bob, the lifeguard Sir Jonathan, bellman Luigi, the housekeepers and guest service center who promptly attended our needs. Everyone is 2 thumbs up, exceptional service!!! Flawless stay!

You don't have to go outside of the hotel since everything is there. Great views, great food, great staff, and one of the most important thing is the great service.
The facilities and amenities are well maintained, imagine how big this resort hotel and they really managed to do so.

Comfortable beds, big rooms, clean bathrooms, very tidy and well organized! Memorable stay for me and my family!

Will surely be back the soonest! :)",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"The resort is beautiful with lot of amenities. Swimming pool is marvelous, kids play area is the additional attraction. It is a MUST stay place for relaxing vacations for anyone be a family, couple or oldies.",Comfort & Facilities
"This was my second stay here and i had a totally different experience this time. The hotel was just SO BUSY it felt like chaos. Breakfast was utter carnage and i almost walked out of the first day- it felt like feeding time at the zoo. That said, the kitchen and waiting staff did an excellent job of dealing with the demand for food and service.
For some reason on arrival my room was set out with the sofa bed made and a cot which was requested to be moved/put away. The cot went but i battled the sofa bed myself, removing the bedding which i left in the corner of my room. This sat there for the duration of my stay. I had a few other incidences of requests which never really seemed to happen. I had some issues with the laundry too.
The hotel is noisy due to the nature of the bulk of the clientele - there were kids running up and down the corridor in the morning and making much noise in restaurants/by the pool.
The bars were running low on stock- they offer cocktails which they don't have the ingredients for (no cachaca for caipirinhas) and despite offering a range of brands for each spirit, most of the time could only offer one type (this was my experience with gin). The waterfront seafood restaurant appeared to me missing half the wine list when we dined there.
The hotel remains a beautiful resort and the rooms are well appointed with very comfortable beds and excellent bathrooms. The service is generally good and the staff are well trained to international standards of hospitality.
The best part of my stay was my evening in the spa. Although the facilities have not changed since my visit 5 years ago and hence are looking a little used, my treatment was just WONDERFUL. The treatment bungalows are beautiful- my coconut milk bath in my private garden was a blissful retreat from the chaos of the hotel and the massage was excellent. I certainly recommend the spa.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Great resort to host an international event, from hotel's facilities to the Clearwater beach, snorkelling to gym then bringing the children to their playhouse. Everything is great except the rates they charge so you are paying for 3-4 times more than resorts around lapu lapu Mactan, that row of resorts that is near to Shangri-la are charging much higher for hosting the event, may visit during off peak to have a relaxing holiday in near future, good job all you staffs of Shangri-la, thank you.",Value for money
"We stayed in this hotel during the cobra ironman event last week. The service was excellent from the airport shuttle, at the hotel reception, room, dining facilities & the shuttle service back to the airport services were excellent.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"This hotel/resort although pricey is set on a good clean beach. The amenities are all very good with everything on offer. It is disappointing that they charge for everything except the beach towels. The service is great and the food plentiful with many choices. It is quiet because it is isolated from any of the locals. Cebu City is an hour by cab depending on traffic and costs about 300php each way. The room was spacious and very clean. The service staff checked it twice a day. The water at the beach is alive with fish and you are provided free fish food to feed the colourful fish on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. I liked how convenient it was to the airport and they run a shuttle service. They have excellent WIFI which is included in the room cost.",Value for money:Staff:Food
"We were one of the first guests of the Shangri-la Mactan when it opened and it was great to be back to discover the upgrades, expansions and be assured that the quality of the service has not changed. The staff were absolutely great and everyone from check-in to check-out and at the restaurants were very warm, welcoming and courteous. We often requested for local drivers to take us around Cebu City and they provided us with English speaking drivers who made life very easy for us even recommended to us some of the best restaurants in the city. All in all our highlights for our trip was a 3 hour massage treatment at the Chi and then dinner afterwards by the restaurant next to the water, under the stars.",Staff:Food:Location
"Just wade in and you have gorgeous colourful fish swimming all around your feet! There is snorkel gear to rent at the beach and it truly is an amazing way to spend time at the beach. I saw that a couple of reviewers complained about the amount of kids and noise so I would have to agree, ideal for families.....not so much for adults only.",Comfort & Facilities
"My family are regular guests of Shangrila Mactan, and I consider Shang my second home in the Philippines. Indeed, was my parents who hosted me for my brief visit this August (which included the stay in Shang) so I only write this complaint— if it may be called so, despite being a four-star review— as a concerned daughter who practically grew up in Shangrila Mactan, and not as a paying guest. Perhaps if I had been the one billed, this would not have been as positive a review.

On our first day there, perhaps because of being consistent Ocean Club and Golden Circle guests (more than five visits to Shang a year, for my parents), we were upgraded to an ocean-view suite. We were unable to check in though as I had a pressing meeting in the city schedule for 3pm, so we took the 1:20pm hotel shuttle. Due to the sudden rain, it took two hours (so I was an hour late for my meeting)... but that was fine, it was unforeseen and there was nothing that could be done. We wrapped up the meeting quickly, and went to wait for the 5:20pm shuttle back from Ayala to Mactan.

It did not arrive.

6:20pm came and went. This was supposedly the last shuttle.

It did not arrive.

At that point I requested my mother to please call Shangrila, as I did not have a local number, and ask what was happening. Note that there were three groups/families ahead of us in line, one of them with two small children, who had also been waiting since five that afternoon. There were even more people waiting in line behind us. We had been standing for two hours as the steps were wet and we could not sit.

The two families and a couple in front of us were also calling, and we could hear the same inquiries. We were told that the shuttle was stuck at SM due to flooding. Having come from that exact route earlier this morning, we understood. And so we waited. An hour passed, and we called again. The same answer. More time passed. We called again. The same. I was beginning to doubt whether this was possible... the 5:30pm shuttle, stuck at SM still? Even though other shuttles from other resorts on Mactan were coming and going? Very odd.

In any case, my mother called Veronica at the Ocean Club who advised us that it was best to take a taxi as she did not know and could not guarantee the shuttle. Best advice that evening. We could not get a taxi at Ayala however as it seemed the whole of Cebu wanted to do the same thing, so we headed to Marriott, where we were fifth in line. Even then, we waited and waited. We had asked the couple in front of us in the shuttle queue— the Wongs from Hong Kong, strangers but very friendly— to share the cab and they readily agreed. The Wongs were also calling Shang but were told nothing.

While waiting at Marriott, they received a call from Shang that there was no longer any shuttle coming as it went straight from SM to the resort, being full. We were shocked! If that was the case, we should have been informed while at Ayala... there was a concierge right there, the General Manager or whoever in charge of transportation should have called them to inform their guests after the first, second, third hour! And indeed, a bit of creative thinking would have been appreciated: this is surely not the first rain Cebu has seen. They could have called to rent a van within the city to bring us guests back. Or simply called to inform us that no one was coming.

In the end, no taxis were appearing at Marriott either so my mother called my father who called my grandfather who called a private driver who came and took us and the Wongs to Mactan. It was nearly 10pm at that time. We had still not checked in. We were so tired, and so hungry, and so, so frustrated. You cannot imagine. Why my 90-year-old grandfather had more power and was more responsive than a five-star hotel... well.

You'd think this review would end up as a one-star, but in the end, Veronica from Ocean Club made up for the terrible experience. She had set aside some food for us from the cocktails that we were supposed to be at but missed by many hours. And the nice servers there even kindly heated up some bread rolls for us. We were starving, and the gesture was very much appreciated. The previously-upgraded ocean-view suite was also a blessing, and did much to improve our evening and the rest of our stay.

Thus, from a one-star (or even zero-star, if that were possible here on TripAdvisor), we go up to four. I still love Shangrila Mactan, and I sincerely appreciate how they care for my parents, but I would have liked just a bit more creative thinking from management when it comes to the shuttle and stranded guests.

By the way we were even charged for those shuttle trips... my mother did not complain, but I certainly took offense. We literally missed an entire day of enjoying the resort because of what I chalk up to lack of foresight or downright mismanagement. One night should have been waived from the bill of not only us, but everyone stranded that night. Alas, nothing was done. I hope the others, specially the that family with the two babies who had been waiting long before we queued up, received better compensation. For me personally, it was Veronica and the rest of the Ocean Club staff who single-handedly made our stay acceptable.

As a final note: I find that over the years Shang has been catering more and more to Asian tourists, particularly those from Japan and Korea. This is evidenced by the signage that is now predominantly Korean. That said, perhaps some signs (in Korean?) regarding littering would not go amiss. I personally witnessed a Korean family leave their garbage in the shuttle and worse, throwing tetra-packs in the ocean from kayaks! The last shuttle I was in had a huge juice puddle on the seat from when they left their food to spill. Unbelievable. Tourism is the lifeblood of Mactan, and international tourism is fantastic for the country in general, but for the good of other guests and the reefs, something has to be done.",Staff:Food
"A very fun and relaxing retreat (5D4N)for the family. If you have kids, recommend that you take up the Family Fun Package (for 2 adults and 2 kids) which was of great value.

The Family Fun Package includes:
-Room accommodation (Main wing) and daily buffet breakfast.
-Daily dinner buffet with unlimited standard drinks. We dined in most of the times as it was not convenient to venture outside for meals. With breakfast and dinner catered in, we only needed to take care of lunch.
-Unlimited access to the Adventure Zone
-Round-trip shuttle bus transfers to/from the airport
-Fish house making activity for the family
-Savings of 15% on Food & Beverage services
-Savings of 15% on CHI, The Spa treatments for adults
-Savings of 15% on laundry and pressing services
-Welcome drink upon arrival
-Access to the Health Club for adults: whirlpool bath, steam room, sauna, gym
-Complimentary in-room wired Internet and Wi-Fi access
-Scheduled complimentary recreational activities

This tropical, beachside resort is beautiful and well-maintained with lots of lush greenery and full of family-friendly activities. There are a variety of swimming pools. The swimming pool at the Main Wing has few sections of pools linked together, each with various depths so that both children and adults can enjoy some splashing, not forgetting the hugh winding water slide. The swimming pool at the Ocean Wing offers a much peaceful alternative. There is the Kids Aquaplay Area & Pool, a playground with water slides, as well as a separate shaded children’s pool. Lifeguards available on duty. Adventure Zone, an 3 levels indoor playground which houses 2 exciting long slides and cushioned play modules for energetic kids, Toddler Zone for infants and children up to 4 years, E-zone featuring pool tables, arcade games, pin ball machine, table football, XBox consoles and a snack bar to keep everyone entertained. There are also daily activities for kids (at extra cost) such as Ceramic Painting, Air Hockey Challenge and Tie-Dye Magic. Golf lovers can practice their swings and putts at the 6-hole golf park or at the mini-golf park where all holes are miniatures representations of Philippines landmarks. We came across facilities for playing tennis, table tennis, jogging (jogging trail), giant chess set and zipline activities, there is a Health Club and Salon offering fitness facilities (gym) and beauty treatment. You can join in the scheduled complimentary activities such as yoga, snorkelling, diving, garden Tour etc offered by the resort at no costs. Frankly speaking, you don’t even need to leave the resort with all these facilities and activities.

A key attraction for us is the Shangri-La Marine Sanctuary and the beach, just a short walk away from the resort which is very private and exclusive to the resort guests only. Beautiful, clean, sandy beach with helpful staff waiting to attend to your needs like helping to find beach chairs, getting towels and ordering your beverages. One nice lady even helped to take care of my son while me, daughter and hubby went for the snorkeling session. Life-jackets readily available for use at the beach at no costs while snorkel sets are available for rental. We had a wild time swimming among as well as feeding the swarm of fishes that swam so close to the shores and around us. Fish feed purchased at the beach counter. The calm turquoise waters also allow for all kinds of water activities such as diving, snorkeling, kayaking, para-sailing, windsurfing, sailing or deep-sea fishing all for a fee, of course. All of us were at least 3 shades darker at the end off the holiday!

Our breakfast and dinner (included inside the package which saved the headaches of looking for meals outside) were settled inside the resort with buffet- style dining at the Tides restaurant featuring an open kitchen and an appetising range of international and local fares while lunches were settled at other dining bars or cafes. The price was not budget friendly but the food and bites were well presented and deliciously good.

Stayed at the Main Wing Deluxe Sea View Room which is decorated in a tropical fashion with materials such as teak and mother-of-pearl. Room is spacious and comfortable with a hugh bed and a pull down bed..Complimentary WiFi was strong and all amenities are in place as expected from a 5-star chain of hotels.

The resort offers city shuttle to the SM and Ayala shopping malls with daily departure schedule at PHP150 per adult. Trip to the city is about 45 min to 1 hr one way.

Services are definitely up to expectations, the staff are warm, friendly and ready to help at any request.

The family is ever ready to make a 2nd visit here.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"My family and I had an amazing time here. The highlight for kids is the beach with the tropical fish right there at your knees the minute you wade in. The service was also incredible. They were very flexible and accommodated all of our needs. The food was good but not great for the price, but that's the only downside. And it's expensive overall, but worth it for a rare extravagant splurge.",Value for money:Food
"My wife and 2 daughters spent 5 days at this resort and we had an excellent vacation. The staff are uniformly trained to serve with a smile. A special shout out to Sheen in the Lobby Lounge, Den in the Chinese restaurant and Imie in Acqua, the delicious Italian eatery. The food is well prepared and tasty but pricey - I often felt strange paying what was comparable to my hometown in Tokyo although the cost of living in Cebu is considerably less. Other positives were strong WIFI through out the hotel and the immaculately maintained grounds. Can't wait to go again.",Food:Location:Value for money

"Beautiful place and an excellent family (with a small child) getaway place. The resort is full of attractions for smaller and bigger children so parents can relax easily and 'only' monitor the activities.
The beach is very nice with - surprisingly - enough chairs for the beach users to use. Service staff is absolutely everywhere and all seam to be very willing to assist with everything. Walking from towel station to the 'third/first' beach area we were asked at least twice on the way by passing staff if we would like them to carry our towels to the place of destination, just to give an example. All our inquiries were attended and if the person asked did not know the answer, they always made a call and found out for us.

"A quick one night side-trip from Manila, my first experience in the Cebu and thoroughly enjoyed this hotel.
Its in a great location near the airport with huge gardens all meticulously maintained. You can walk out the door and bang there it is.
The hotel itself is elegantly laid out, the staff are very friendly and helpful, you won't be able to get to the door quick enough to beat a waiting staff member ready to great you. Rooms were well sized, modern and very comfortable.

"I stayed at Shangri-La's Mactan & Resort Spa for 5 days from July 8th to 12th. Everything was so perfect during my stay. Restaurants in this hotel have wider variety of foods. I really enjoyed having breakfast at a restaurant ""AQUA"" that is located in Ocean Wing. It is a pool side restaurant and really cozy and with nice atmosphere. You can have delicious food (including an omelet made in front of you), very fresh fruits and fresh fruits juice there. Especially, mango and mango juice were awesome!

The private beach is very clean and there are lots of beach chairs. I read some comments in tripadvisor website ""you should go to the beach early morning to keep the chairs"", but always sufficient number of chairs were available even I went there at 10am or aｒound noon. (it might depend on the season though) Water is very clear and you can see colorful fish (even nemo!). There is a beach restaurant too, so you can grab good hamburgers, snacks etc... and alcohol (of course!). But you should bring some water from your room as a bottle of water costs 150 peso at the restaurant.

I stayed on the ocean club floor that was on the 7th floor. The view from my balcony was wonderful. As everyone says in here, the amenities on the ocean club are L'OCCITANE. These are basically replenished twice a day (during the day and turndown service in the evening).

Room, the hall way, gardens... everywhere in the hotel was very clean and well maintained. All staff members are well trained, they always greet me politely with smile and that makes me feel I am really welcomed.

I went to ocean club lounge around 5pm almost every day to have some drinks and canapés. There are about 10 - 15 kinds of canapés, fruits, cheese, bread, alcohol and soft-drink. Those foods were enough for me as dinner.

If you want to go to shopping mall, such as SM / Ayala Center, you can take a shuttle bus from/to this hotel (150 peso per person for one way and this is charged to your room). I recommend to make a reservation at the reception when you go to the mall, but you don't have to when you come back to the hotel. There is a shuttle bus stop at the mall, so wait there and just get on the bus (you will be asked your room number by bus driver).

I really had a wonderful time at Shangri-La Mactan Resort & Spa and definitely recommend this hotel to people reading this comment!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri-la still lives up to it's reputation as being the best resort in Lapu Lapu City. We stayed a total of 3 nights, and although the weather was not all that agreeable, me and my family still enjoyed our stay. The rooms are clean, the beds very comfortable, I especially like the balcony so that you can step outside and just enjoy the sea breeze. We had the good fortune if being upgraded to one of their min-suites for one of the nights, and a welcome fruit basket was waiting for us. The room smelled wonderful as well! The beach was clean, the white sand soft on the feet, and you get to swim with tropical fish! They even give you free fish food! All their staff, from the life guard, to the front desk, to the gardener, demonstrated excellent customer service, their warm hospitality made you truly feel welcome! The pool was nice as well, and they even had a little water park play area for the kids! We had some issues with our room, (lock malfunctioned, wanted a different type of bed, some maintenance work going on the room across the hall) and their guest services did an excellent job, we had to move rooms several times, but they handled it flawlessly that it did not put a crimp on our stay at all! Aside from being on top of it and resolving the issues right away, they even sent us a small token of chocolates as well as a note card to apologize for the slight inconvenience! Now that is what you call 5 star service! I was very impressed!. The room came with free breakfast vuffets as well, and those were definitely something to look forward to in the morning! The wait staff, the chefs, they were all very pleasant. Eating good food is definitely a good way to start your day! I would like to commend all the staff, especially Terrence, one of the front desk managers, for giving that exceptional service to your guests, foreign or local, please keep up the good work! I am definitely recommending this place! A bit pricey but worth every penny!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"The last time I visited was with family and friends and it was during peak season. They had to entertain a lot of guests so we had a lot of waiting to do. Let me just write about my previous visits.
As you step into the lobby, as you see the smiles of their staff, you will already feel that you are there for relaxation. They serve welcome drinks and they accommodate all their guests as soon as possible. Going to the room, you will feel more excited as you look around what activities and leisure awaits. Maybe when you get to lay down on their comfy bed, you might want to sleep and just stay in, but don't, there is more fun waiting.
Shangri-la has three big pools with one mini water park for the kids and the enticing shades of their sea. Wherever you plan to sun bathe, you can still indulge yourselves with their drinks and food. They have cyber zone and timezone open for all ages and the kids can get hyped up in their playrooms . I remembered asking about their other activities, they have this daily sports activity wherein you can register yourselves to join. Their golf area is open for certain time during the day. With their food, I only tried their first-rate breakfast buffet and the dinner in Cowrie Cove (I will talk about this in another review). I haven't tried the spa but other reviews say it is a must try, of course it is gonna be a splendid time, expect rates to be high. You might wanna try different water activities, you can inquire at their beach shop. What else do they offer, shops (souvenir, jewelry), salon and there is a desk in the lobby where you can inquire about tour packages.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"As always, Shangri La Mactan never fails to amaze me. The scenic beauty of the beach front is a great way to start every single day of our stay. The resort is not crowded, which we loved. Visiting here during off peak season is the best.

A very warm welcome from Ferdinand at the airport always put a smile to our face he is very accomodating I remember him 2 years back who have arranged a shuttle for my family to the resort. The Horizon Club Manager Nica never fails us in any way. She's always the same professional, accomodating and hard working perosn we've known since the last two years we visited. She made sure that I have a place to stay for my family while we are waiting for our room. She accomodated us at the lounge and always made sure we are taken cared of. She gave a room close to the reception at the ground level to ensure easy access for my kids to the pool and adventure zone. Every moment we enjoyed because of her good gesture and hospitality. All the staff at the horizon including the kitchen were all courteous and provide excellent service! I cannot remember all the names but jasmine, katherine, karl, melcy, jennifer are worth mentioning. The managers Venessa and Terence were extremely professional they make every moment worth remembering. These are the fantastic people worth coming back for.

"We have just visited Cebu for 8 days and was a very enjoyable experience that was provided by the friendliest hotel staff I have witnessed anywhere in the world. From Lindsay as the meet and greet to Sarah in Lounge Bar to Guia in Tides for breakfast all became like family. I am sorry that I don't recall everybody's name as all were extremely naturally friendly. I have been in many hotels where the ""plastic"" greetings etc are the norm. This is definitely not the case here. The quality of food overall from a Westerners diet was excellent. One issue which I have reported is about replenishing the dinner buffet, the quality products was not up to scratch. In particular the Roasted Pig which when I arrived at a reasonable time was confronted with a carcass. Not good enough. Hopefully if you are reading this it has now been resolved. As long as Shangri La don't price themselves out of the market and they are close with the nightly rate it is worth a stay. The staff will make up for the price paid.",Food:Staff:Value for money

They have an anticipated mass at 5PM and then so many restaurants to choose from for dinner. We usually love to hang out at the cowrie cove for some drinks and they serve the best mango shake.

"We stayed in the Ocean Wing, King Ocean Club Room.
The room was everything as advertised. Bed, linens, toiletries, all amenities, and the service was as perfectly nice as described and advertised. All of the highest quality.

The breakfast in the Ocean Club was also very nice with a moderate but appealing selection and the option of an a la carte breakfast menu. The service in the Club room levels is excellent and all the staff is eager to please. Turn down service, airport-hotel shuttle bus was efficient and good.

The food at the restaurants was also very good but I believe some dishes could have a little more refinement. There was also no roasted meats (roast beef, roast chicken, etc.) in the buffet at Tides Restaurant except the roast pork Filipino style which is not to everyone's liking. The price commands a bit better offering.
There is a buffet for kids which kids themselves can serve-- super cute!

You MUST MUST order the Ceviche at the Breeze beach cafe. It is perhaps the most delicious ceviche I ever tasted in the world. Sorry Peruvian Ceviche, this ceviche is a homerun.

At the Waves bar, the Cosmopolitan is yummy.

The variety of restaurants and selections make it unnecessary to leave the hotel during your stay. The water sports activities are varied, clean and safe. All in all, a great place to be.

The beach is wonderful, clean and there are lots of colorful fish just on the shoreside. Marvelous!

I will return to this hotel so that I may enjoy a bit more peace and quiet which was disturbed by a very happy and joyous Indian wedding which lasted 3 of my 4 days.

I'm no sourpuss and enjoy a good party as much as anyone but since most of the guests to the Indian wedding had access to the Ocean Club they simply took over the lounge and it was very noisy. It was thoughtless to the other guests who were simply there to relax.

Perhaps the hotel could have created a secondary space for all the wedding attendants so they could laugh, shout, dance, and make all the joyous noise a wedding calls for without disturbing others who simply wanted to relax. 3 noisy days out of my total 4 days to enjoy was just too much of a loss. The hotel should have warned us about this when we made our booking.

Since there were only a few guests who were not wedding participants (yours truly) then, another area could have been designated to us for the duration of the wedding. Considering how expensive my room was, I would have wanted this deference. The staff apologized often and profusely.

The wedding participants took over the lounge at breakfast, cocktails, and whenever they needed a place to all (or many) to converge.

I will go back to reclaim my quiet lost. I just hope I get a better rate :-(",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

The only complaint about the hotel room was the shower/tub. No matter where we situated the shower curtain and positioned the nozzle, the water would pour out the sides and onto the floor so we needed to get extra towels to mop up the floors. All the restaurants on the premises were varied and good especially traveling with 5 kids and 4 adult who wanted to eat different things. There are many pool areas so we always found a covered chaise to relax. The kids had a lot of activities to choose from like the E zone(arcade), jet skiing, snorkeling, zip lining and mini golf.

I am in the travel industry and spend half of the year travelling, staying in hotels around the world. For a resort hotel this is as good as ive seen. Lots of thought has gone into every detail of the hotels operation. Its not run this well by accident. Huge credit to the management and staff. Not cheap but for what you get its great value.",Staff:Value for money

"A couple friend of mine had to cut their trip short so they offered me to use their last booked day at Shang. I was staying at Be Hotels so this upgrade was a definite no brainer.

The room was impressive with a such a huge king-sized bed. The hotel facilities and amenities were top notch. It's sad that I didn't get to take advantage of it all since my day was spent with group activities outside of the resort.

Thanks to my friends for such a kind gesture! :-)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"This is a fantastic resort. The swimming pools, the restaurants and bars, the rooms and the entire property are really nice. It is located about a 15 minute ride from the Cebu airport, which makes it a really convenient place to stay. There's not really anything near the hotel (i.e. easy walking distance) except for a couple of small shops across the road, so you may want to bring some snacks with you to the resort (they do have a shuttle bus that goes to a couple of huge malls in Cebu, but we didn't go there....apparently they charge for people to use this, which seemed odd to me given a hotel shuttle bus is usually free, but I don't think it was very expensive). I thought that the convenience store they have at the hotel was a bit of a rip off (e.g. PHP 150 for beer, which cost PHP 50 across the road, but I guess this is a 5 star hotel and it's only a couple of USD different anyway). The food was amazing - everything we ate was awesome. Tip: have breakfast at Acqua...less crowded than Tides, it's nice to sit near the water, and it actually had better food than Tides (even though it was a smaller selection). The happy hours at the various bars are good value...we took advantage of that every day. If you ask the cleaning staff for more water, they will give it you...this is worth while doing, as the water bottles they put in the room were kind of small (but they do replenish twice a day with day cleaning and turn-down service). The gym was quite small, but we were there every afternoon and had no problem getting on the equipment we wanted to use, so I guess it's not too popular. Note that this place is very popular with families of East Asian tourists, and to a lesser extent well-to-do Filipinos (I didn't see many westerners), so a lot of what they offer seems to cater to them, especially Koreans.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Shangri-La's Mactan Resort & Spa is one of the resorts you should stay in at least once in your life. Their service is above par -- you'll be well-taken cared of and you'll be pampered. Their staff is so courteous that each and every one of them will greet you as you walk past them. They're also very friendly and chatty (in a very professional way). They will talk to you about their promos, their facilities, their activities, etc. The Shangri-La grounds are impeccable. Covering what looks like hectares of land, the brand has truly showed what it is to live in a place where everything is there and you wouldn't want to leave that place. We stayed there for only 2 nights and 1 of the nights we went to the City, and we already wished we didn't. The resort is like a city in itself.

The downside to all these wonderful amenities is that the food and beverage price points are high. In terms of a developed country's standards, their prices are comparable. However, in Philippine standards, they're expensive.

Overall though, we'd recommend the place to literally anyone -- families, honeymooners, friends, etc.",Value for money:Staff:Food

"Stayed in Ocean Wing Panorama room on the 4th floor, with nice front beach view.
Lobby and the Ocean wing section seems to be a bit dated, remaining sections of the main building is not looking much younger. Nicely manicured grounds and the beach may uplift the overall value for money.
Breakfast in Tides (we have not tried bkf at Aqua) is generous in variety, but those who expect luxury five star spread would not find i.e smoked salmon, olives etc for that matter.
Spaghetti with crab meat / sauce for dinner in Aqua was great.

Beach is man-made with patches of sharp sand sometimes not comfortable to walk on, but clean and well maintained. Snorkeling, is great, plenty of fish to be seen knee deep or further in deeper water. Expect to pay 600(+) peso for gears unless you have your own.
Jetski 2600peso for 30min.

Pools are great, and let me ask here? are you the one who leave belongings on sun bed and disappear for hours? do not blame staff as they do try to help. Water in the main pool gets really warm in the afternoon, Aqua side is cooler.

Management host happy hour on Friday late afternoon. It is meant to be a proactive event to get to know customers view, but I had an impression that on 22May the lady attending my section had a 45min free style conversation, with one customer, partially about Shangri-la in Kowloon and mainly cruise ship experience - I can grant a credit for professional culmination of above conversation at min 59. Job done, time to go..... Wine and canapés were nice, though.

Airport transfer is included in Ocean wing rooms. Metered taxi from the airport cost 150-170peso and takes 15-20 min, to the airport - as per hotel.

Sofa bed in Ocean wing room is good to accommodate a kid, although large, might not be comfortable enough for an adult.

"Our holiday in Cebu was started on a wrong note. Room allocated to us was not the one I've booked for via the official website. Upon entering the room, I realised the wrong type of room was given to us and I made it known to the front desk. We can't get our supposedly booked room as it was full house that day. We have to wait till the next day before we can get our correct room and had to go through the hassle of shifting. Actually because of this screw up, we kinda of wasted a day in Cebu. But thankfully, the staffs made the remaining stay a very nice and wonderful one.

Appreciate the Duty manager and the Director of Rooms effort to rectify the problem and get back to us on what had happened. Thank you Mr Raja and Rommelle for rectifiying the problem for us ASAP.

On the whole, the stay was good. Do try the Chinese Restaurant there. It's good! We tried the In Room Dining for 2 nights, you guys can give it a miss unless something is done to improve the standard of the food. In room dining food is not up to par. Don't miss the Chi Spa too!

"This resort earns every bit of its five star rating and then some. I need to start this review with the staff: they were extraordinary. This is a very large resort and yet they knew some of our grandchildren's names early on. If one of our party of eight was not present at breakfast they asked. After learning that I am gluten intolerant someone would come up as soon as I entered the restaurant and asked if I would like them to make gluten-free pancakes and gluten-free toast. The people who cleaned our room remembered we like extra water ... I could go on but I think you get the idea.

As for the accommodations, our rooms fronted the ocean. Most nights there were big events on the beach. It is a premier wedding destination and yet we never heard any festivities except when there were fireworks.

The choice of activities for our family (67, 67, 39, 37, 7, 5, & twin 18 mos) were numerous. The craft center has a list of different activities for different ages throughout the day. We were comfortable leaving the older two during the 45 minute craft. There is a room for older kids and adults with pool tables, games etc. etc.

The beach has plenty of chairs, umbrellas and people taking drink/food orders. The snorkeling is good. I have been a scuba diver since the '70s and have never seen starfish the color of the ones we saw there.

"We are disappointed with our stay in Shangri-La Mactan. We came to the hotel at 2pm to check-in but we were told there is no available room yet. As we find it totally unacceptable, we asked to talk to the manager. The manager brought us to a waiting area wherein the food trays and pitchers are empty and promised to comeback after 20 mins but didnt comeback as promised. By the time we check-in, its already 3:30pm and maybe as a gesture, the manager promised our check-out to be extended at 4pm. Fast forward our check-out day, we came back to our room after lunch but we can not enter already. When I called the guest services, he told us our check-out time is 12nn and when I explained to him that we were promised an extension, that is the only time he checked with the duty manager. From the time I put down the phone until the time they gave us the extension card key, it took us 30 mins to wait. With 2 kids in tow, the experience was horrible.",Staff

Great place for a work conference, especially is spouses and children are invited. We were looked after amazingly well by the conference staff.

Only problem in the whole stay was the shuttle bus to the airport was very late in turning up at the hotel so leave in plenty of time before your flight or take a taxi.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Our expectations were high, as we know the Shangrila standard. But have to say we were extremely disappointed here. Stayed 2 nights, cut our stay short because it just wasn't worth the exceedingly high rates they charge. Much prefer Imperial Palace (where we stayed on our previous trip to Cebu), as it was superior in all respects. The property itself is lovely, but very disconnected because it's so large. Too much walking to get to the pool, not easy with small children in the heat. Need golf carts. Shuttle service between wings is exceedingly slow. Rooms are good enough, but in-house service is shockingly slow. (Check-in took us almost an hour!) Food was likewise disappointing, not at all worth recommending to anyone. Buffets were the worst.

"THE Shangri-La's MACTAN Resort and SPA is such a Luxurious hotel with a touch of excellent service.
I 've been in Cebu three time and I'd stayed mostly in a resort so I can enjoy my vacation. First I'd stayed in COSTABELLA Beach Resort-this resort is a romantic type resort but small though but it has a good room and good service.. On my second visit to CEBU, I'd stayed in Blue Water MARIBAGO Beach Resort-my kids enjoy this resort. It has a great pool for kids and we love it.
BUT Shangri-La's MACTAN Resort and SPA Hotel is the Best by far I've been to. My room is a Deluxe Sea View, it has a fantastic view of the main pool and the sea,Great amenities, staff are courteous, Early buffet breakfast is a must if you want to get a good table and if your having it at Tides restaurant, they have a sumptuous food with a touch of western, Asian cuisine-lots of fruits and salads-we love it. Although, dinner at BUKO Bar are bit pricy-may because of the cultural show, but then again it has a great food. I didn't manage to try other restaurant because my stay is only 3days/2night (which I usually do if I'm going for holiday)but I did manage to go to Cebu City to buy some souvenirs. Their Beach front are a bit of a white and golden brown, (I can't compare it to Boracay Island which is totally powder white sand) although the beach of Shangri-La is shallow-a perfect for the kids but you will enjoy it as you go farther part of the sea. You can feed the fish as well, its fun actually.
All in all, this is a wonderful luxurious resort, a perfect paradise to relax .",Food:Location

"Personalized greeting at the airport with private shuttle to this resort ten minutes away is just a sampler of this world class resort. Have been twice and will return. Why?
The service is impeccable. The rooms are tasteful and spacious enough each with private balconies. The restaurants serve delicious foods catering to many cultures. The facilities are almost endless. The fitness club has steam, sauna and whirlpool with a special tea served gratis, for example. But it is the white sand beach fronting a coral reef teeming with tropical fish in crystal clear waters that really makes this a superb resort in our opinion. Because you can snorkel right off the beach into this wonderland. Water is nearly perfect. Then there are the grounds of the resort, just lovely. The walk to the fabulous seafood restaurant, the quality of service and the cool band playing music in this indoor-outdoor venue are all worthy of smiles. For families there are several huge pools for water play with slides and hoops, all attended by great staff. And the white beach of course.
While criticism should be included, there is really nothing to criticize. The hotel can be full but the facilities are never crowded. It can be a busy time say for check in or out but you would never know it. Relax and enjoy.

"This is a very large but beautiful resort that harkens back to luxury resorts of an earlier time and place. Set on Mactan's Northern shore, the resort covers extensively manicured grounds and a prime beach front. The resort offers extensive activities, both on and off the water. It's facilities include a half dozen or more restaurants and bars, as well as a two large swimming pools

Despite its size and complexity, we found the resort provided a relaxed and friendly atmosphere throughout our stay. It is not at all unusual for staff here to call one by one's name, and regardless, everyone is greeted with a smile.

Having spent time at the Shangri-La Boracay resort, there are certain things about Mactan that we like here better, others not so much. Mactan's restaurants, especially Acqua, are much better than Boracay's. The beach and beach activities are slightly better here as well. Whereas, the rooms and some of the public areas, are superior in Boracay. In fact, if we had one complaint with Mactan, it has to do with the rather dated and plain room furniture. An update is seriously needed. We stayed in an Ocean wing room, primary because of the additional benefits offered, but it is my understanding that the older wing may have superior rooms and suites.

Overall, this is a very nice resort that provides both superior comfort and above average range of activities. I would happily return for a longer stay!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Shangrila Mactan is truly an amazing experience. The ambiance, the room, the beach, the food -- everything was just perfect. Breakfast buffet was the grandest I've seen as compared to other 5-star hotels in Manila and even abroad.

We were part of a conference group where foreigners were present, and they all had praises for the place, especially the food-- fresh seafood and fruits at all outlets.

The group was given a discounted package for the use of the beach, conference venue, etc. but we came to know that the lowest room rate was like $300++. We also came to know that this place is always fully booked so for anyone who has plans, book your holidays well in advance.",Food:Value for money
"Room and surrounds were lovely, service was great (everyone greeted us as we walked by) and the food was better than expected (particularly the Italian at Acqua - would eat there every meal if I had my time again). Sadly, resort information/orientation was lacking upon check-in and a few of the details online were incorrect but the manager explained that they were in a transition period and this would be amended in the very near future. Also disappointed that pretty much every activity is a cost-add (including kayaking/snorkelling which are typically free); with very VERY little to do for the western tourist outside the resort, you can't help but feel the victim of a slight bit of entrapment. A lovely stay at the Shangri-La Cebu overall though.",Food:Staff
"I stayed here back in 2000 so cannot comment on any date past that. My room was on a high floor with an ""ocean view"". The customer service was outstanding and the room was very clean. Fresh fish was offered at the buffet and the food was good. You do have to pay for everything separately, not much included in the room rate, but overall I really enjoyed my stay here.

"I was in Asia for 2 weeks (China / HK for 1 week and Philippines for 1 week). I stayed at this resort at the end of my trip and couldn't have asked for a better way to end my wonderful vacation.

It's a beautiful and well kept property. They staff are extremely friendly (every single one of them) and always greet you. Every thing is clean and just feels like a 5 star resort.

I stayed here for two nights booked through two different reservations (one using credit card points and the other with cash). The first night, I was upgraded to the Ocean Wing. It's their ""premier"" wing. Unfortunately, I checked in at night and left early morning so I wasn't able to get a look at the ocean from the room. However, it was nice and there was fresh fruit laid out for me.

The second night I was put in the Main Wing. Honestly, it felt more up to date than the Ocean Wing and I don't really see the need to stay at the ocean wing unless you want access to the ocean club. However, I will note that there are more kids / teenagers in the main wing who can be loud and obnoxious. More on the guests' fault and the hotels.

The gym / fitness center was wonderful. Full squat rack, plenty of benches and free weights, a cable machine, medicine balls, plenty of cardio machines, and weight machines for those who use them. Really top notch for a hotel.

The beach was well groomed and clean. There were plenty of seats when I went. There are two pools which both looked nice from what I briefly saw.

Breakfast was included and was absolutely delicious. There were so many options at the buffet and everything was great. I also dined at Aqua and had a stellar experience. The service was on point and the food was very good.

Wi-fi is free and very strong. Having travelled to Palawan and Malapacua before, it was nice to get some strong wi-fi available throughout the whole property.

The gorgeous property and excellent service make this the top choice in the area. I cannot recommend the resort enough, and will surely stay here again if I return.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I spent 4 nights at the resort with my wife and 5 year old child in Feb-2015. I am very happy with the stay and would absolutely recommend anyone to stay there. The staff is very warm and friendly and the service is very good.

Airport Transfer and Check-in
I requested for an airport pick-up and there was a representative who was at the arrival hall and who helped me to bring my luggage to the car. However, what surprised me was that there was a staff waiting for me at the hotel entrance when I get off the car. She was the front desk staff who walked my family straight to our hotel room and the check in formalities was also performed in my room and not at the front desk. I find this to be very wonderful as we can start to unpack and rest up after our flight immediately and we can also have our young child in our room straight away without him being distracted by the pool and so on.
Hotel Room
We had a room overlooking the beach. The view was breath-taking. The hotel is not new and to some extent, it shows its age. But overall, I find the hotel to be well maintained. The management obviously taken pride in trying to upkeep the place.
Dining
We had all our meals at the resort though-out our stay and did not dine out. Generally, it is not difficult to get a table during lunch or dinner. However, during our stay, there will be a line at breakfast. We are early risers and are not really affected. However, as we finish breakfast we will walk pass a line of people who are waiting for a table. To the staff’s credit, despite the large crowd, they try to clear the tables as fast as they can and seat people as fast as possible.
The food is adequate and I think for a resort relatively good value for money. I don’t have any complaints.
Gym
There is a nice and relatively large gym overlooking the lawn and horizon. The equipment is quite adequate. During my stay, I don’t experience any crowding/waiting at all. The staff there are also very attentive with the towels, bottled water.
Beach
The beach is quite clean, the staff did a good job clearing the sea weeds and any litter. Although there were quite a lot of loungers and so on, I noticed that the guest have a tendency to ‘reserve’ these early in the morning. As such, I would advise you to do the same if you want to get a good spot. My family then to use the beach in the morning after breakfast, my family make a point to remove our towels and make the loungers ‘available’ right after we leave. The staff also told the guest that any unattended towels will be removed after an hour. During my stay, I did witness some guest asking the guest to find them loungers and I can see that the staff is trying their best to help them.
There are ‘fish feeding’ days where you can get free fish food from the staff and feed the fishes. The fishes will swim up almost right to the water line. It is really amazing to see fishes surrounding us when we are standing in water that is not even knee deep. My son had a wonderful time as well.
Pool
They have two pools and they were both busy when we were there. There was the problem about ‘reservations’ in the early morning at the pool as well. We usually go to the pool in the late afternoon when the sun is not too strong and when my son had woken from his nap. When we get to the pool, all the loungers are taken up and reserved with towels and items. We usually can manage to locate one/two to use. When we were there, we witnessed some loungers who are reserved but unused for a long time. I think the attitude of some of the guests will need to be improved but this is no fault of the hotel/staff.
In the main pool there are a lot of activities for kids. And overall it is very very kid friendly. There is a small pool for small children and it also have a sun shade to protect the young kids from the sun. There are also some water slides which my son do not dare to try. The slides are for children only and not for adults.
There are ample life guards on duty, I noticed that the life guards are very alert and really keep a very good eye on the pool which I think of it as a positive thing.
But overall the feeling of the pool is very ‘family’ and I think couples without children or singles will probably feel a little out of place and will think of it as too noisy.
Other activities
There is an area where there are a lot of slides with an additional charge. I left my son there for about an hour while my wife and I have some couple time. There are a recreational room with lots of different arcade games. These are payable but very affordable. My son really enjoy ‘air hockey’ and we have to play a few games very day. There are also some pool tables. The overall vibe is very family.
My family booked a karaoke room for the fun of it. We sang some of our adult songs but they also have children songs and my son have fun singing karaoke for the first time.
Important note for families
On the very last evening at the resort, we realized that every evening, there is a get-together for families, we attended the event and there were free food and wine for everyone. There is a video being shown and the children can watch the video while eating while the parents can chill out. For parents with a young child, this setup is wonderful!!! Our only regret is that although we stayed in the resort for 4 nights, we only know about this on the last night. It was not really advertised well. There was a signboard next to the function room where the event is held and only when we walk past it and read it will we know about this.
Even then enjoying it for one evening is wonderful.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

and even then you'd be ok if they actually gave you a clean room. unfortunately the management is always apologetic but nothing has changed over the years. they cater to mass market and do not care about anything but taking your money because lets face it your room will not be assigned to you till you arrive because they will sell it at last minute at an inflated price to someone else. its not fit to be a Shangri-La property

"Context
We are a well travelled professional couple travelling with two very young children. We have high standards in terms of service and generally choose branded hotels.

The Service
Generally very friendly service. Some disappointing features such as functions taking over the facilities of the hotel to the detriment of the hotel guests not involved in the functions. This included the main restaurant having massive queues for breakfast as the ocean wing breakfast place was closed for a wedding party.

The Beach
The beach itself wasn't that special, coves rather than a vast expanse of beach but the sea was beautiful; aquarium clear and the fish swim round you. The temperature was perfect.

The Pool area
The splash pools and swimming pools were great for the children. The ocean wing pool was particularly picturesque. The number of lifeguards around was excellent. There were also life jackets provided for children.

Food
We ate at the buffet restaurant every night which was nice but very seafood heavy. For lunch we ate by the ocean wing pool which was better than the other restaurants. The ocean wing restaurant was also better than the main restaurant for the breakfast.

Room
Was nice, modern, clean. We had a suite which allowed us access to the ocean wing facilities. The size of the room was very good and comfortable for a family with a cot and single bed for our older child. Our room rate included unlimited laundry which was great, leaving the hotel with clean clothes! There was noise from functions audible in our room on some evenings.

Other
The soft plays were great for the children. One for babies/ very young children and one for older children. I was less impressed with the arts and crafts type stuff available. There seemed to be less of that kind of thing than what we have seen in similar hotels in the past. The beach was so great though (including a covered child area with lots of toys) that we didn't miss there being more child stuff in the hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We stayed there last April 21 - 24, 2015. We had an Ocean Club Room. The room has king size bed and a sofa that you can convert into a bed upon request. We are two adults and two kids (8yrs old & 3yrs old). Club rooms have access at Club Lounge for breakfast, all-day beverages and evening cocktails. If you have extra budget its better to stay at the club rooms and suites :) The room & bathroom are clean. Internet connection in all parts of the hotel is excellent. My husband arranged a surprise dinner at the Observatory Cowrie Cove (private dining area) for our 9th yr wedding anniversary. The food & service were impeccable. Worth the price! The lady that served us took care of our 3 year old daughter while we were having our dinner. That's not part of her job but she happily did that for us so we can enjoy the night. Thank you again Miss :)) Sorry we forgot your name. My kids enjoyed the childrens pool & aquaplay. They also enjoyed swimming at the beach especially my 8 yr old daughter. She was amazed of the fishes and corals which made her more excited to swim at the beach with a lots of fish. 4 days was not enough for us to enjoy all the amenities because there are lots of things that you & your children can do inside the resort. All the food that we ordered in the restaurants inside the hotel are good. The only downside for me is that they are closing the ocean wing pool & half of the main pool at 6pm. I think 6pm is too early for a beach resort especially during summer where there are lots of guests who wants to have a night dip in the pool. They should at least open it until 8pm or 9pm. But overall we enjoyed our stay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"we went to cowrie cove restaurant for valentines dinner, the food was good, plated nicely and the ambiance was great, staff was attentive to our needs, we also had a chance to walk around the resort. they also had a long stem rose for the ladies the thing that i didnt like is we were seated a bit far from the terrace which had the best view of the sea, we came in early so i expected the place was going to be packed thats why they did not allow us to seat on the terrace but as the night went on i notice that there were probably only 3 couple on the terrance and the tables there were empty while the other couple were cramed on the inside part. that was such a waste of a view and for the price of almost 6thousand for 2 persons for a 3 course meal u would expect to get better seats.

another dinner was the dinner buffet at the tides. there was a wide array of food to choose from great, the sea foods was especially good. the staff was attentive to ur needs as well and very polite. i was a little disappointed with the buffet selection thought, there were a number of cakes to choose from but nothing special, some dry, others are okay nothing that i was crazy about. the chocolate fountain was pretty good, they used high quality chocolate, the ice cream was good too, crepe station which i got so excited about was a little disappointing, no cream and the sauces and topping had nothing special about them. over all still a good dinner buffet1",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"A stay here is simply divine! The rooms, surroundings, grounds are all perfectly manicured and cared for and yet you don't feel intimidated or over-serviced by staff. The staff are either just genuinely wanting to please (and give the sense that they love life and people) or the staff training is beyond perfection. Either way, you feel well looked after wherever you are in the resort. Amazing food and amazing facilities. The resort is expensive and price of drinks/meals etc., tends to be excessive but for the wise (those who venture into the many bars during Happy Hours of which there are plenty) the sting of cost is lessened somewhat. Too many great experiences here to name but, suffice to say, the offerings are aplenty and always match or exceed expectations. Great snorkeling here too is a bonus (the resort has its own coral reef).",Staff:Value for money:Food
The stay was everything that everybody has been raving on about. I don't think there is a better resort in Cebu. I stayed there for a few days with my boys and there was plenty to do for them as well as enough places for me to relax - I highly recommend it.,Location:Food
"Stayed here for 9 nights over Easter . A few grumbles first so bear with me...

We decided to stay at the shang following numerous positive comments from friends in Hk. Seems to be one of the best regarded hotels for families with kids that is easily accessible to from Hk.

Arrived at the airport and things were pretty chaotic. We had opted for a private car by prior arrangement but had to speak with 3 people and work down a lengthy list with them to where are names were. Most top hotels in the region would have a name board In arrivals so you could identify where to go.

That said, short hop to the hotel, which was great.

Upon arrival, we were met by the manager that mentioned the room we booked was not available but they had a better room for us. We got to the ""better room"" and it only had one bedroom and no kids bedroom (which was exactly the reason we had opted for the one we did, six+ months before arriving. We asked to speak to the manager again who said it was busy because of Easter and if we wanted the room we had booked, might mean someone else would have to move to another hotel. Er...... So they are not happy with this room either?

To be fair, room was changed and we got on with things. Very happy with the new room; however, no cot available for our 8 month old...

Again this was sorted after much complaining. So, the hotel addressed our concerns in the end but the point is, when arriving at a hotel for a break, with a very young family, guests want to feel more relaxed entering the hotel, not more stressed.

Apart from that first day, the rest of the trip was really good. The kids club is awesome. Loads of space and great variety for them. The staff in the kids club and ezone are brilliant.

Thought the video night was a great idea for the kids. Even had a hot dog and pop corn trolley, which was included in the package.

Food was generally pretty good. Liked the Italian's pizza and the snacks from the pool bar.

Staff very friendly across the resort. Service could be a bid hit and miss but hotel was very busy with Easter and staff were quick to respond if chased on something.

One think I really liked here that I am not normally keen on in hotels is the lobby bar. Nice place to relax and has been done up really well. Decent bands in the evening.

A massive plus for adults is the dive centre, which is one of the best equipped I have seen at a resort style hotel. You can access some nice dives very close to the hotel.

The beach is great. Fish swim right up to you on beach and kids can feed them knee deep in water.

Wife enjoyed the spa.

Gym could do with a little TLC but staff were really great.

The club room was nice.

Overall, a really good hotel for families and some excellent facilities. Marked down a notch simply because of experience on day 1.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Just a mere 20 minute trip from the Mactan International Airport, and you have reached Cebu's own paradise that is, Shangri-la Mactan. This is our second visit to the luxury resort and it did not disappoint. Even sprinkled a few new surprises. The property is sprawling and have well maintained its facilities despite showing some age in its rooms. There were several new things added like the pool adventure for the kids and the now bigger Tides restaurant for breakfast. Service was impeccable with warm smiles and a greeting wherever you may be.Your request attended to with a great professionalism and a desire to ensure you enjoy every detail of your stay. And that's exactly what happened. The beach with its pristine waters. Kept clean at all times. The restaurant with every personnel on the look out for your needs -- even anticipating them. It has been such an unforgettable trip. We can't wait to plan for the next one soon!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"The hotel is beautiful, food is fantastic, beach and pools wonderful. The best thing about the hotel is the staff who are all great. Jessa at the pool was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Prices are generally high but mostly worth it, other than the soft drinks which are way overpriced. We drank a lot of water which they will provide for free when asked. However, with the prices being what they are I would have expected better separation of children's areas to adult areas so that you could find some peace! Would therefore probably not recommend to couples but it is perfect for families.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"This is our second trip to the Shangri-La in Cebu/Mactan, and it seemed to us that the resort had improved since our last visit. The accomodation and facilities seemed to have been updated, and it was a thoroughly enjoyable holiday.

We visited during the busy Easter weekend, and the hotel was at capacity for most of our stay - which is usually when you see service etc. stretched to the limit, but the Shangri-La's excellent service withstood the pressure with ease.

This is the perfect holiday for a family with active kids (the snorkeling off the beach is fantastic) - I am not sure that I would recommend it as wholeheartedly for a grown-up only holiday.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I had huge expectations from this supposedly 5 star hotel but sorry to say it was a huge let down. Dirty bathroom, outdated decor, old carpet, small room, delayed check in, delayed luggage delivery to the room and charge for everything made my stay unpleasant. You cannot find chairs by the pool, the artificial beach sand hurts while walking barefoot and the beach is rocky. The hallways have dirty appearing pebbled floor tiles, the ocean wing carpets are old and dirty, the ice machine on 6th floor was not working and the whole experience is too commercial. A guest needs to feel pampered which I did not experience here. Do not go there. Save your money and go to a 3 star hotel. You have to pay even for the kids play area. Not only that you have to buy a long sleeve T-shirt worth 450 Peso to go to the kids play area if you don't have one.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Cleanliness
"We spent 4 nights there in April 2015, just after the Holy Week in the Philippines. It may have been because of the timing but the room rate of approx.USD800 per night for a Panorama Suite in the Ocean Wing was simply not worth it and we won't spend that again to go to the Shangri-La. The room had a number of issues that required attention by the housekeeping and maintenance teams (broken chair, non functional TV, non functional telephone, broken Aircon motor (room was FREEZING), rocking table,...and the list goes on). The room was also very dated and in desperate need of an upgrade (previous reviews confirm this) which the Director of Rooms agreed with. Annoyingly previous posts raise similar issues and yet the hotel continues to charge the same rates for the same sub-standard quality. All this being said, the team at the hotel responded well and our bill was adjusted in the end because of the issues. The service at the hotel was fantastic and the facilities are very very nice indeed. The beach in the afternoon is great and the kids loved every minute of the stay. We will return for sure but I do hope either the rates will make more sense or the rooms will have been significantly improved, or it just isn't good value for money (Php650++ for a glass of Sauvignon Blanc is VERY expensive even by Asian standards).",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

"This is our 2nd time in Shangrila Mactan. It was still fun despite the hotel showing its age. The front desk staff was not as attentive though as the hotel was fully booked when we stayed. This was depressing. Housekeeping staff did a good job in keeping us satisfied with our requests though.

I specially appreciated the fact that we were able to redeem our Golden Circle points on food and beverages.

Only issue we had was we were not automatically given the 10% discount when we dined in the hotel's restaurants except for Tides.

Overall, it was a good stay. Rooms are clean. Beach had a lot of corals and fish.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"This property was so disappointing, especially after our trip to the same property in Boracay last year. It is not a resort, rather it is a hotel that wants to be a resort. To begin with, our expensive Ocean Club room was very dated. The bed was uncomfortable, the bathroom needs to be updated (tub only), rugs were grubby and the tv reception was terrible. The internet was just 'ok' in the room...hopeless anywhere outside. We went during Holy Week here which means that the hotel was completely full, even overflowing. We were unable to get dinner reservations in a couple of the restaurants as they were fully booked. There were no chairs available. people did their usual thing of taking ownership at what must have been 5 am by placing something on a chair...and then failed to return all day. There ought to be some way of policing this rude behavior. I have been in resorts all over the world and while this happens, there are attempts to stay on top of it. Also, finding anyone to provide service while at the pool or on the beach was next to impossible. I had to hunt people down to get drinks or whatever. As well, never try a special food order here. You will get whatever is described on the menu and nothing else. You will get it with a smile but it will not be altered in any way, and under no circumstances will it be removed from your bill.
The Tides restaurant is very good....but every, very expensive.
Also, keep in mind that you are next to a very large city. If that is what you want then fine. You can even see the buildings under construction from the view in the very expensive room. If you want an escape, go to the Shangri-la in Boracay and give this overrated, hotel pretending-to-be-a-resort a miss.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"I always avail of Shangri-La Mactan's Day in Paradise whenever I have time when I return back for my holidays. I actually first inquired about Boracay but learned that they have discontinued it so I went back to Mactan. I always visit Cebu and never have I missed going to Shangri-La Mactan. A Day in Paradise includes lunch buffet at Tides Restaurant (or breakfast), use of pool, towels and other amenities plus discounts on spa and other things. It is a family-friendly environment and kids would love it. Hotel's staff are very accommodating too. I went there last 15 March 2015. The buffet was good. They served native delicacies too which I think I did not see last year. The staff at Tides are very friendly and accommodating especially Ms. Guia. She certainly make you feel at home and she is funny. I could say the overall experience was very good and will be back there for sure whenever I have time.

"Super Accommodation! Seriously one of the best I've had in my travels. One good experience I have is that I did ask for room service. Expecting the normal bellboy to bring up my order on a plate, I was surprised that they set up an actual table for 2, complete with plating and a flower.

They would also surprise you when I come back to my room after the day and find my room transformed for sleeping, Sheets all pulled back and a book mark on my bed inviting me to just quiet down and read a book. It was such a relaxing experience. I slept really well on their bed.

I would recommend just staying in whenever you're here. The resort offers so much things to do that my 3D 2N there wasn't enough. Add to it the fact that I was busy shuttling myself and my guests all around the Cebu City proper as well.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"It's given that the resort is beautiful, I'd rate the room, facilities and dining experience a 4.8 but what brought my rating lower were the little things:

1. I arrived a couple days later than my husband, so when he checked in, he asked the front desk to put a note that I will arrive, add my name to the room, so when I get there all I need to do is show ID. But when I arrived, I had to wait as if I was checking in again, maybe even longer.
Totally different experience from Makati Shang, where as soon as I arrived, they welcomed me warmly, didn't have to wait at all. I think Mactan needs to be better in getting/noting special instructions from guests (or referring to it), so guests will have hassle free stay. Normally, I wouldn't mind waiting long, however I came from a 10-hour flight (with delays), so all I wanted then was to finally relax.

2. On our 2nd week, my name suddenly disappeared from the room and during breakfast, the hostess said that my husband needs to sign for my breakfast (meaning, pay). We had to go to the front desk to see what was going on. It was some rates issue but it was cleared up. This was the 2nd not so good experience after arriving so I was kinda getting an 'unwanted/not welcomed feeling' lol

3. My husband works at night so he sleeps during the day, I'm on vacation so my sleeping time is normal, I sleep during the night. We normally have the 'do not disturb' sign for the most part of the day, unless we ask for room cleaning or order in-room dining. A couple of times my husband received calls from the front desk while he was sleeping, I was outside. The first one, asking if everything is ok, that they noticed that the do not disturb sign has been on for a while, second about his membership. There's a reason why it was on, regardless if the guest wants the room cleaned or not, 'do not disturb means do not disturb'. Second, they should be aware of the reason of their guests' stay or even look at the trends/activities based in their record (dining, laundry, room/car service).
It makes the stay feel more personal and will also avoid those kinds of situation. The calls woke him up, and unfortunately, hd a hard time falling back to sleep.

Again, comparing it with Makati Shang, Makati was much better in making their guests' stay feel more personal. When my husband was staying there, they remember his name, even the kind of tea he orders, the time he goes to the pool and the times they can or cannot call him. I don't want to be too hard on this as I understand that it's a busy time of the year, however the fact that they don't seem to have reminders on their guests' records is disappointing.

4. The pool doesn't get as busy in the morning, however people reserve chairs as if there's no tomorrow. You'll see 90% of the chairs are reserved before 8am to 10am without people on it. I just find it rude. We'll get there before 8, limited to no chairs available, so at times, we end up in an isolated area or just place a towel on the floor. We're usually done by 10am and we see most of the chairs reserved still unoccupied. This just annoys me. I know it's not the hotel's fault, but I hope there's a way they can avoid this. The attendant we spoke with said that people reserve chairs then goes to breakfast or wherever. One attendant also mentioned that some of those guests who do that are Golden Circle members which I still find rude and unacceptable. Guests should have courtesy towards other guests. We are also Golden Circle member but we know we are not the only guests in this resort. we respect other guests' right to enjoy themselves.

Again, it's a given that the resort is beautiful, great pool, great beach, nice clean room, good food!
I also want to commend the staff in the pool area, very nice and hard-working people. They go above and beyond their job to help you be comfortable.
Needs improvement on front desk (or at least be better in taking instructions, add them in guests' record and referring to those when needed)

As I mentioned, these are little things, however they add up. I still had good stay but I wanted to give this feedback as I hope to see improvement in the future when I come back :)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"We were invited to our friend's birthday at Shangri-la Mactan. This place is awesome! A paradise of its own. Rooms are great, services and amenities are superb. And of course the pools, you can choose from infinity, to slides if you have kids. But surely you will not jump into the pool if you have the fish sanctuary right at your footsteps as if you are swimming in an aquarium with variety of school of fishes.

I will suggest if you are visiting Shang Mactan ask for a room facing the sea.

If you are with friends or family and to elevate the bonding time hire a big boat and do island hopping, which what we did. The boat will cost you around 10k or 200 dollars. That will include your lunch at the floating restaurant and this is superbly cool as in. Anyway the itinerary was to visit islands and sanctuaries near Bohol or in Bohol. I strongly suggest that you do Bohol fish sanctuary first before going to Olango island. Or I think you just need to choose with the packages but for me fish sanctuaries must be on the top of your list. The rest of the island hopping will be just an icing on a cake.

Don't forget to bring your sunblock, suntan lotion, your booze and drinks, and good music. The boat is huge it has comfort room and beanbags. I love those fish sanctuaries and literally you are swimming with the fishes.

Island hopping finished at around 5pm. By that time at Shang cocktails are buy one take one, so enjoy the sunset cocktail before having dinner. I enjoyed their Singaporean Sling as to compare with their Mojito.

Dinner time we went to this restaurant called Lantaw. A Filipino cuisine and serves mostly seafood. This restaurant has its own character located at seashore. The food is great and reasonable!

To sum it up! I had fun in Shangrila Mactan. As it is you will enjoy this place. And Surely you will be sunkissed!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

The snorkeling was incredible, make sure you buy an underwater case for your camera, there are so many fish & beautiful blue indigo starfish. This is a great place for beginners to learn snorkeling.
In regards to the spa we always like to go off site & try along with the locals. There are 2 massage places very close to the resort that u can walk to, one I think was called shade tree I just can't think of the name if you walk out of the hotel, cross the road & go to the right. It's only a 5 min walk. You can do a 90 min oil massage for approx $24 USD. I got sunburned & I got a cold aloe lotion massage, they are great!!!! They even can pick u up at the hotel.

Have stayed here I believe 4 times now and each stay just keeps getting better and better and something is always different each time much to returning guests' delight. I got the club floor room again and was happy to have gotten a room facing the beachfront this time, right smack with a center view. It was breathtaking. Though there was a little hiccup when i checked in, the lady handling my room in the ocean wing club floor made up for the delay in securing my room. Even then, the service was and is always spot on here and I am never disappointed with anyone I deal with at the resort whether waiter, pool and beach attendants, room attendant everyone speaks the same customer service language. I was amazed at how they have separated the check in for the ocean wing guests as it is quite a distance from the main lobby. The only thing that was a bit shocking was the crowd and line for breakfast at 730am in the main buffet resto. It could have been handled more efficiently to lessen guests queuing up for 15 minutes to wait for a table to be freed up. The resort was extremely full but they should be able to handle that situation better. But other than that, even the ladies at the spa were great knowledgeable and cordial without being too patronizing.

A special thanks to the whole Aqua staff (and especially the chef!) who were always kind with our kids and nicely fulfilled our requests. If you fancy a quick lunch by the beach, go for the skewers! So yummy!
Rooms are spacious and spotless. Bathrooms are fully equipped with both adult and kids necessities (toothpaste, swim nappies, soap and no-tears-shampoo).
In Asia we stay exclusively at Shangri-Las and we can guarantee Mactan Resort is the best resort of this chain. Also Mactan Resort is the best location of the island, water is crystal clear. Snorkeling in the Sanctuary will leave you breathless!
We are looking forward to go back!",Food:Location:Staff
"We went to The famous Shang at Cebu during the recent Chinese New year break. As is to be expected, the hotel was full to overflowing at the moment (ended up running into two of my colleagues there too- not something I was looking for, mind you). So the legendary service was a tad stretched - breakfast queues being the chief culprit, and food running out.

Other than that, just need to reiterate - absolutely stunning beach. No need to really step out of the resort. The seafood restaurant (Golden Cowrie) is amazing. service (outside of the pieces I listed) was actually excellent. Even though I could not get an extended check out - it wasn't difficult to see how full they were running and it was entirely ok.

Would definitely visit again, but my preference is a bit to the equally excellent Shangri-La at Boracay for even more stunning views and a bit bigger rooms.",Food:Staff:Location
"Stayed in Ocean Club room for 2 nights on way home from Cebu, was sad to leave . We only stayed in the resort did not venture to town and chilled at the beach. The snorkelling was good and did see some nice fish, the beach staff were very good and help with finding loungers and cabanas.
Went to the Acqua and Cowrie Cove restaurants both were very good.
The club lounge is good however in holiday times be prepared for families coming with young children which can get quite noisy. there used to be a family lounge but this is now closed.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Got here before Valentines Day and before the Chinese New Year. Lot's of Asian visitors because this is a popular destination while it is winter in Korea, China, Japan, etc. It can get real busy during check in but the staff was very professional and accommodating. Their beach and coral reef is good for short snorkeling else you can take a trip to Nalusuan.
Food at Tides (especially breakfast) is awesome. Don't forget to have the famous Cebu mango.",Food:Staff:Location
"Our second time to the resort. Both times we've stayed it the Ocean Wing. Our first visit was almost 2 yrs ago for Easter and loved it. So we went this CNY break as well. It still lived up to it's wonderful memories. I read reviews before going back so knew to expect the long queues for breakfast and the whole lounge chairs to be reserved very early issue. I don't recall this being an issue when we went in 2012 for Easter but the hotel was definitely at full capacity this CNY. I do agree the rooms need some updating but they are very clean and comfy. I hope they update the Ocean Wing rooms soon? For breakfast, we mitigated the long waits by putting our names down then taking a walk on the grounds and they had a very nice balloon twister man who also helped make the wait better.

As usual, the service was very good, always smiling staff. I found the food little above average but not amazing- except for Cowrie Cove which we 2/3 dinners during our stay (again, made reservations as it was the CNY holiday). The grounds are lovely and very relaxing. It was great seeing our 2.5 yr old run around and squeal with delight. We were still in awe with the lovely beach and tropical fish swimming everywhere. Pools were lovely and there are so many activities to keep children of all ages busy. We used the hotel sitter so that our daughter could run on the beach while we relaxed a bit in the shade. The sitter was fantastic and our daughter asked for her to come back the next day which is great as she's usually wary of strangers. My husband played tennis with the tennis coach and enjoyed it. The second day we made it into family tennis and let our daughter run around the side of the court ""playing tennis"" as well. We ate at the pool bar (not too impressed, maybe ordered wrong stuff-papaya salad was Filipino style I guess as it did not taste like the typical Thai or Vietnamese style); aqua (good pizza and bread); beach bar (husband enjoyed his burger); tides for breakfast (not the best breakfast buffet ever but did the job well); rooms service (after dinner desserts plus milk for daughter) and our favorite Cowrie Cove (very good).

All services were great but for the second time we tried to book the sail boat and it was still broken! We tried to book it 2 yrs ago and they said it was broken. Annoyed that they post prices for the different types of boats when none of them are functional even 2 yrs later.

All in all, a great place. It's now become our go-to for a family break. Gorgeous grounds with stellar service.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"My husband and I just returned from a three night stay. The hotel is wonderful and the service is great.

We booked the Ocean Panoramic view room, it was lovely. The room was a nice size and spotless with a balcony that had a table and chairs overlooking the ocean. We arrived early in the morning and the front desk staff said once the room was ready they would call our mobile. 40 minutes later, we were given our room keys. This was a nice touch.

The food was fantastic. Every restaurant was delicious, our favourite was Aqua, we ate there multiple times and the food and service was always perfect. The pizza is a must try!

Also, visit Cowerie cove, which is perched overlooking the ocean, the atmosphere was great. I suggest making a reservation for dinner, we did not (as no one told us too) and we were turned away. Lack of space doesn't bother me, however the way the hostess dealt with a full restaurant is something that needs improvement. After we were told there was no room, we tried to make a reservation for the following night. However, The hostess said there was no room for dinner the next night, without even checking the log book. When we got back to the room, I called reservations anyway and were given multiple time options. This was the only time service faltered.

The grounds are gorgeous and there are multiple pools to choose from, as well as the beach. So even though the resort was busy, you don't really feel it because the grounds are so large and there are so many chairs.

The snorkelling at the resort is amazing! They have their own coral reserve and there are so many types of fish to see. The waters are crystal clear and there are an abundance of fish making sightings super easy. The hotel offers snorkelling gear for rent, among other beach activities.

Another highlight on service that needs to be mentioned. We had lunch one day at the cafe on the beach and we wanted a club sandwich but it wasn't on the menu (it is on the menu at the pool restaurant). The waiter offered to get it from the other restaurant for us.

This was one of our favourite beach vacations and we will definitely be returning.

Only complaint, I emailed the hotel twice with a question about my invoice and its been almost a week and still have not received a response. I am not sure why the wonderful hotel service ceases to exist once you check-out.",Food:Staff
"Had a very pleasant stay in this resort hotel - every staff member delivered a professional and super friendly service. Consistent and true hospitality at every level, the property and gardens are pristine and always well maintained. A sincere thank you very much to the leadership and each and every staff.",Staff
"Typical Shangri-la experience in terms of service and facilities/amenities. Service from all the staff we interfaced with, from the frontdesk to the lifeguards, was A+. They really make you feel welcome and appreciated. I love that there were so many activities that the kids could do while at the resort. The food was excellent too. The place was packed but you never felt unattended.

Highly recommended!",Staff:Food
"We stayed twice at the Shangri-La, Mactan either side of Sinulog, both times in an Ocean Wing Panorama Suite.

The staff were very courteous.

The hotel is quite old but very well maintained and has a very nice character.

TV reception in the hotel was poor, either in the rooms or public areas.

The gardens and grounds are very beautiful and well kept and have some quiet areas if you want to get away from the crowds, which congregate around the pools / beach.

Beach is small but well maintained and we did not experience the 'towel on lounger' issue mentioned on other reviews. The Sea and snorkelling area is very nice.

Chi Spa:
If you have access to it (either getting a treatment / staying in the Ocean Wing) then use it if you want a nice quiet place with a pool / saunas etc. away from the main areas which can get crowded.

The Rooms:
4th floor Panorama Suite (4001):-
Had no handles on the outside of the patio doors to the balcony so closing / opening from the outside is challenging. Also the curtains in the living room do not provide blackout so not ideal if a 3rd person is sleeping there. Seat in shower is badly broken/repaired

8th floor Panorama Suite (8001):-
Has a really nice view and has a lot of shade on the balcony. (* I tried a few times to write this without it sounding amusing...) The noise of wind buffeting the bathroom window sounded like a typhoon but actually the weather / wind was not too strong when out on the balcony. I think the wind must catch the outside of the building to make it sound worse than it is. (* I failed)

* There are usually functions taking place in the evening on the beach below the Panorama rooms / suites that overlook the sea, which are noisy but they stop at 10:00PM so it's not too bad.

Ocean Club Lounge:
You have access to the lounge if you are staying in the Ocean Wing. It's a nice facility to have, as there are free soft drinks and nibbles throughout the day and between 5 and 7 there is a free all you can eat and drink buffet.

Food Outlets:-

Tea of Spring:
Food was nice. Service was shambolic.

Aqua:
The food at Aqua was excellent. The staff were not very knowledgeable about menu.
*If you are staying in the Ocean Wing, Aqua is the better option for breakfast as the food / ambiance is nicer than the Ocean Club Lounge. However the Ocean Club Lounge is still very good and has a different menu so is good for a change. Coffee when sitting outside at Aqua is tepid before you add milk - so ask for warm milk or coffee from inside which comes from a machine and is served in mugs.

Cowrie Cove:
We planned to eat at Cowrie Cove but upon reading the menu found that there was no vegetarian option and (as I am vegetarian) we left.
On another evening we did have a drink at the Waves Bar (next to Cowrie Cove) but there was a band playing in the restaurant and another band playing on the beach and with Waves bar (and us) in the middle, the ambiance, which could have been really good, was spoilt.

Tides:
Food from the a la Carte Menu in Tides was very poor. My Wife's gnocchi was pretty much inedible and my vegetable biryani had no dhal and the vegetables were almost raw. We should have complained at the time but did not.
We did not try the buffet at Tides but it looked quite extensive.

In terms of food I would say the restaurants could do better. Also there is not much Filipino food (I think one buffet which we did not try). If you have transport take a drive down to Lantaw Floating Restaurant at the other end of Mactan Island and eat there one evening for sunset. You may not think it while driving there but it is worth it, the food and ambiance is excellent.

On the whole this is a very good hotel that does cater for different kinds of holidaymakers who enjoy a bit of luxury.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Stayed just before Christmas to relax, we paid the premium price, informed hotel of our arrival, asked them if everything is ok and fine in the hotel... they did not say anything.
When we arrived in the hotel --- where we should expect calm, relax and tranquil place... but alas! we've got noisy, dusty and chaotic hotel reception area, loud banging as if you were on construction and their renovation is too much to handle of guests being damped like refugees.
The place was full of dust, smells of paint, sand, cement and they have to check us in to the farthest side and still able to here the banging and the noise of their renovation. At least they should have the decency to tell to their guest or at least an option to say ok.. if you dont want to stay .. you are free to go and we'll refund you. But hell no! if you walk away they will keep your money greedily without returns.. since their renovations are printed on of course, the small prints.
In short your supposed to be quite and relaxing time has turned into hell.
They don't have at least the consideration to use the full facilities and the spa is only for guest they prefer.
Yes, food is great but thats not what other people are aiming for in a luxurious hotel like this.

You may say... I'm too fussy about this, well I paid a premium and i should get one.

Well .. as expected you can't get away with it.

Stressful at its premium price.

"We stayed Jan 31 to Feb 1 to attend the wedding party of a good friend. The Shangrila Mactan is the yardstick of luxury hotels in Cebu. Check in and check out was a breeze. The rooms are clean, spacious and well appointed with average internet speed. There are a lot of facilities to keep you busy, a fantastic lagoon-shaped pool and it's own private beach which is considerably clean. Everything could have been perfect except for the breakfast experience. We were hoping to have a peaceful and an unhurried breakfast but during the time of our stay, there is a big conference group that the hotel is hosting. There were easily 200 people in the dining area with some hotel guest queueing at the entrance waiting for seats to be available. Seems like the conference participants have taken over the whole dining area and were jostling to get their food. People were talking loudly, children running around shouting. The management should have served the conference group's breakfast in a separate area/function room so that other hotel guest can leisurely enjoy their breakfast. Me and my friends could have better enjoyed our short break if not for this breakfast incident.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We have been to a lot of hotels from the Philippines to some Asian countries bur never had this experience and treatment as we had in Shangrila, Mactan. Even my American husband was surprised about the treatment. We stayed in the Ocean Wing where the view of the beach was amazingly beautiful!! The staff are friendly! Every single of them will greet every guests! Wow! Never had like that in some hotels! Though this is the first time that we stayed in a 5-Star hotel but the price you pay is really worth it! The room is huge and nice! Complete with everything! The first thing that I always look for everytime I enter into a hotel room is ""slipper""! Wow there were 2 pairs! Towels are abundant! Everything i needed were there! Restaurants and bars are all nice. You feel all the comforts in a 'vacation"". By the way thanks to the group of Myres! To Joel, Michael, Ramil and Belinda of TIDES, Dennis, Dick and Psyche of COWRIE COVE and Joemarie of Tea of springs you guys are all amazing, very welcoming and hospitable! We already have plans of going back on April or May with our daughter..... Thanks Shangrila!

The rooms were booked through the event team and any changes were really difficult. Called thrice and still no amendments. They would not follow through on their commitments tosending emails.
Resort is a bit old I guess..but being maintained well.
No restrooms nearby their conference rooms.. the nearest one you had to walk and go down a level..
Had a sea view room.. but not a great view...not worth it.

Beds, together with the sheets and pillows,will bring you to dreamland instantly. There are a lot of activities for the family, specially kids. The beach and pools are great for bonding with children. If you're honeymooners, don't expect a quiet and romantic experience here. The breakfast food is limited but good.

Everything about this hotel was fabulous — from the room, to the bars, the restaurants, the food, the ambience and most of all the staff.

We literally never left the resort as we heard some horror stories from other and decided with a 2 year old it best we stay. We found different things to do every day and it could not of been better. Rooms are a reasonable price but were nothing special . The staff were very well trained and professional even helped us check in at 4 am. The Breakfast was beautiful and perfect. Lunch was pretty good and a good atmosphere ( we chose to eat at the beach bar ) The dinner selection was Average. The Buffet and Sea food Restaurant were both good.

"We attended a wedding and stayed here for 3d2n, together with my husband and mom. It's my 2nd time to stay in this resort & I must say the place is still great! It doesnt disappoint!

Room: we got upgraded. I loved everything about our room - the beds, the bathroom, etc. The room we got didnt have a view of the beach, just the trees, but we had a view of the sunset. Since the room had a veranda with lounge chairs, we spent a considerable time just lounging around & enjoying the sunset view. What a treat!

Service: impeccable. Staff were very courteous, helpful & prompt to attend to every need.

Food: breakfast buffet was realllllyy good! They have such a wide selection of menu, with fresh fruit drinks & even pinoy comfort food such as bibingka, etc. it's so filling & so good, i get hungry just writing about it.

Amenities: we enjoyed swimming around - water was at the right temperature at night - quite warm. We also used their jacuzzi, which was a good time to bond with my mom. We also had fun trying out their giant chess board & table tennis. We also saw facilities for kids - Perfect for families with kids.

"The one thing that stands out is the world class service. The moment you step in you are greeted with a smile. I have a 2 year son who is allergic to dairy, wheat, egg and peanut. All the restaurants at the resort were very accommodating to my son's needs. The executive chef would personally come out to ask us what to cook for him. When eating out with a child with food allergies isn't easy but Shangri-la's staff made it so easy for us. Even when my son didn't want to eat what was given, they would suggest another allergy friendly dish.
The property itself is beautiful and immaculate. Though the pool areas are ok, I feel they need to be updated to make it more modern. The beach areas are nice and the water warm. We preferred swimming at the beach. Though my son enjoyed the kiddie areas of the pools.
The room we had was a family room in the main wing with 2 queen beds, seperate living area and balcony. As expected from a 5 star hotel the room is nicely decorated and elegant. Our room was also a few floors above the lobby where the evening entertainment plays, can be abit noisy if you plan to stay in the living area, though the room windows are double glazed so you hear minimum noise.
The food is nice but be prepared to always eat there as there aren't many places to eat outside the resort. Plenty of choices at the food buffet for breakfast and dinner. The Chinese restaurant had great dishes. As you would expect, food is a little pricey.
Overall we had a great experience as a family and would definitely stay again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Wanting to take a rest before I went to Shanghai for business and having had wonderful experiences with other hotels of the chain , I decided to book a 4 days vacation in Cebu Shangri-La . It was expensive but I deserved it !

Fist of all , if you do not garantee your reservation with a credit card , they do not take it into consideration . So be aware !
The check-in area was a zoo when I got there ! Having booked a room with a view and being a member of their preferred customers club I assumed I was going to get the best room in the price categorie I had reserved : Sea view there was but the sea was far ........very far..........!Construction sites and main lobby entrance were a lot closer !

The room : nothing special . The bath room ...a green liquid was coming out of the floor , the sink was clogged . OK Let's stay cool

After a short rest it is time for dinner . The buffet seems to be the best choice : What a dissapointment ! We are on an island but no fresh fish dishes . Sorry there is sushi ( tuna and salmon only ) directly coming out of the freezer . The price is astronomical for what you get : mainly deep fried pork or chicken . Very little plain vegetables : In summary do not go there if you are on a healthy diet . The chef is Dutch . Does that explain ????

If you are not with small children forget the pools . The beach ? Could be nice but corails prevent you from going further than 1 meter into the water . A board shows you pictures of very exotic fish you are supposed to see in the water . Big warning : do not touch them !!!
No risk I would......... I did not see any !

Morning breakfast : same place , almost same menu as last night's dinner . Nothing fancy : do not expect smoked salmon , you won't find it , at least I didn't

Next day at the beach : a big part of the beach is reserved for a party held for people from India and you cannot access it . Let's hope their food is better than for the hotel's regular customers . I wasn't given a chance to try anyway . If I could not share the food I could share the noise . The speakers were full blast with exotic music ( at least exotic for me though not local )
In the afternoon call for the muslim prayer . We share that too !!! with the same noise level . I thought the Philippines were a catholic country . The pope is visiting tomorrow

Smoking is only permitted in designated areas : this is great except the people from the party do not seem to be bound to the general rules . They smoke in the restaurant . when I complained to one of the waiters , the answer was : "" the manager saw but did not say anything ""
Guess what : he is from India

Only positive note : everybody in the hotel is very very friendly and tries to help .

The bill : over 1800 $ for 4 nights for a single person . I timidely asked for a discount since breakfast price is for two and I was alone ??? NO

While the resort building/kids' pool is dated and needs renovation, the service is very good and it's a friendly place for families. The snorkeling at the house reef was excellent - tons of fish and clear water, easy to access from the beach. The 6 course New Year's dinner at the waterfront restaurant was one of the best meals I've ever had, our kids enjoyed the kids' club activities, and the resort also had a amazing fireworks show right in front of our room. Staff was always friendly and tried hard to please.

"Resort and the beach were great, however, food quality was not up to par with a 5 star rating of the hotel. The food menu for the beach was very limited, nothing healthy, only fried and fast food stuffs.

We had the breakfast buffet every morning, same stuffs, nothing great, noodles broth was too sweet. For the dinner buffet, again it was pretty average, the turkey was too dried and the stuffing was lumpy. Even our kids were commenting how average the food was for a 5 star hotel with 5 star prices.

Don't try the Teas of Spring chinese restaurant because it was much better before, but on this stay, the food was terrible. We ordered Westlake beef soup, and it came out with corn in it. The scallop with tofu was with a very sweet black bean sauce. The yangchow fried rice was lumpy and soggy, not using jasmine rice but local rice. The pork rib has no rib, but a big piece of pork overlay with, again, very sweet sauce. It seemed to us that the meal was done by local cooks instead of a chinese chef. Totally disappointed and again, not worth the price we paid.",Food:Value for money

"This hotel is perfect in every way. I read the many reviews before choosing the hotel and noted that many reviewers said this was a family oriented hotel, geared for children, and I was a bit nervous as we are a retired couple. Whilst this is true, we enjoyed every single day of our 14 night stay. Yes, there are lots of families, but if you prefer your holiday to be to be quieter, then stay in the Ocean Wing. The rooms there are spacious with extremely comfortable beds, and all the amenities you could wish for. This wing has its own restaurant for breakfast which is much quieter than Tides the main restaurant. Both restaurants have a huge selection of beautifully cooked and presented food, everything your heart could possibly desire. The Ocean Wing has a pool that is very quiet as the fancy water equipment for the children is at the main pool.

We ate in the Italian Restaurant, Aqua and also Cowry Cove which is situated right on the edge of the sea, both were absolutely superb. Comments have been made regarding the expensive price, but this is a five star hotel, both restaurants are in lovely surroundings, we thought the restaurants were good value. We also often went to Breeze Bar for cocktails, this bar overlooks the sea and just wonderful.

"Stayed here for a week in November in the Ocean Wing at a club level room, the rooms are nothing special I had to change rooms as the noise from the club lounge was intolerable. The things I did not like about this resort was the queuing for breakfast which I found very frustrating also the Italian was closed for three days when we were there because of a conference and a wedding and also the Ocean wing pool I found this unacceptable especially as you pay a premium to stay in the Ocean wing and no compensation was offered for this inconvenience not a good Shang experience. On the plus side the staff at this hotel is so helpful and friendly and Shang should be really proud of them. The food at the various restaurants is very good and I know it’s pricey but that is what is expected at a 5* hotel. The man made beach was small but very well kept and again superb staff nothing was too much trouble would recommend this resort but the Ocean wing needs major refurbishment and especially the club rooms they are really dated and I think the club room needs to be enlarged and what’s on offer i.e. food and snacks etc. these are not on par with the Dusts and Centres where snacks are available at all times.

"This is a huge, top class hotel resort.
The place is very cleanly kept and one of the hotel's strongest point is its staff, smiling and helpful, really relaxing.
The pool is excellent for families/kisd with slides, large shallow areas, lots of lifeguards.

The hotel is quite big but even full for Xmas, one could still find a beach-side/pool-side lounge without having to wake up at 5am and throw down towels at a random chair. The only place that feels 'packed' is the Tides buffet at breakfast (noisy but very large choice of food).

Besides breakfast which was really nice, food ranges from average to good. Even the Chrstmas dinner at Cowry's cove was underwhelming. That being said, the setting of the Waves bar/Cowrie's cove is really nice and cozy, has to be checked at least once.
The food ""problem"" is compounded by the fact that there are no real food options around the hotel (unless one wants to go to the city, 30mn/60mn away, depending on random traffic jams), so one might get a little ""bored"" after a few days (depends on how much you're a foodie I guess).

Finally, the beach is small but clean, without random sellers, and it's really surprising to see such coral reefs/fishes so close to the shore, the kids really enjoyed it!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I rarely write a review about an hotel, but this time I decided to make an exception.

We have spent 7 days in Sangri-la Mactan and it is certainly the last time we go there. It is a good place for kids and my daughter really enjoyed the kids club there. The rooms, the facilities are OK. We had several issues about the hotel, but we could deal with most of them.

Now the biggest let down, the food is a real joke there!!! We had most of our breakfast in Acqua, and even though the food was not so great, the staff there was always courteous and friendly. However, the Christmas Eve dinner at Acquawas really disappointed with Potato chips (like the lays chip) served with our salmon.... the buffet dinner at the pool was horrible, but it was not really a surprise... The most disappointment event was the romantic dinner at the cowrie cove which was a total disaster. First we had to move inside because it was too windy outside, but cannot blame anybody for that. When we booked, we were supposed to have a bottle of champagne, but it was only two glasses according the waiter. Finally it seemed that it was a bottle and the waiter made a mistake, but it was too late when they realized their mistake. then I ordered a glass of red wine which was served at the room temperature and I was also unable to get a glass of water during the whole dinner. And then the food was a huge let down, the lobster was deep fried and it tasted like any kind of deep fried fish. during the middle of the meal, we just decided that we have seen enough and then we paid the restaurant bill and leave the place.... For compensation, they have given back the bottle champagne and gave us a free lunch at tides on the next day. We appreciated the compensation, but it can replace this very bad experience.

If you care about you are eating, we suggest you to avoid that place...",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Heaven in Cebu. Amazing relaxing place or even fun. Everyone is extremely courteous and friendly. They're there to guarantee you a wonderful time. There are an amazing variety of restaurants and bars on the property.

The lobby is wonderful and rooms very clean and relaxing. The rooms are designed with upscale local materials giving you the best Cebu experience.

Not one resort in Cebu can come close to Shangri-La's standards. It's worth every penny. You just go, unwind and enjoy paradise.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"One of the city's premier resorts. It's on the high end but they really take good care of you. Renovations to their lobby and front desk were ongoing and occupancy was high so you can imagine it's how busy the receiving area was. That's to be expected. Breakfast buffet had an incredible choice of cuisine featuring popular dishes from different countries. Dinner buffet was great too albeit a bit expensive but the very wide choice to food was mind blowing. Their wine buffet was worth the extra cost.

The rooms were well maintained and our family deluxe room had ample space for 3 kids to enjoy their stay without feeling cramped. My only disappointment was the missing mattress on the pull out couch. It had the bed sheet, pillow and blanket in a bag but without the mattress it was useless. It was late so I didn't bother any more.

Loved the rainfall shower head! Spacious bathroom and well stocked supplies. Staff were courteous and always wore a smile on their face. The grounds and facilities were all very well maintained just as they were 7 years ago when I first visited.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Visited the Resort and my family loved it!

We have never been to the Philippines but this Shangri-La Resort is one of the top resorts that we have visited. The hotel grounds are big, with lots of space for the kids to run around.

My kid loved the kids club and the water slides, which provided child minding services for hotel guests. The Hotel also provides a cultural show where guests can enjoy Filipino culture within the hotel.

Best thing we loved about the Hotel is the Marine Sanctuary. Just walk into the waters, and there are corals and marine sea-life to explore. No need to take a boat out to the islands at all.

Totally loved this hotel, and will definitely go back! :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food

I want to thank the receptionist who allowed me to check in early & check out late without any addtl fees. There are wide selections of food in each restaurant. The buffet is great and the food served were delicious. The room is odorless and spotless. Some special requests I asked were given on time. I want to commend the driver of the shuttle who made an extra mile by dropping me off to the place I want to go. The staff were courteous and respectful. Everything in this place are picture perfect. I didn't know they have a card reader in the business center. I guess all you need is all in this place. The only downside or observation was they allow some hotel guest to swim wearing t shirts and shorts, they also allow Koreans and Chinese to swim with long sleeves. I hope they should be stricter when it comes to swimming attire for hygenic purposes. They should provide a golf cart if you want to go from one place to another, the place is too huge and I got tired of walking. Its too expensive but its all worth it, you get what you paid for.

The 6 hole pitch & putt golf is fun but a needs some love and attention. Enjoyed a delicious grilled parrot fish in the lounge overlooking the ocean at sunset, and an extensive buffet breakfast and lunch in the main restaurant. Room was large, comfortable and well equipped. Definitely recommend if you are in the Philippines and looking for a luxury get away.

"Our family is a large one, three adults and 2 babies, one a terrible two years old as we say in Australia.
We had our reservations as to how this would turn up, our first day was memorable, we had a ton of luggage and from the moment we landed in Cebu our moves were totally handled by experts.
Even our kids were catered for and we felt cocooned as never before by the professionalism of Shangri-la staff.
every single day we spent in our ocean wing was better than the previous.
At this stage we got to know some of the staff which helped us with our large family in looking after our security and my hyperactive 2 years old daughter. I'd like to give special thanks to Willy Barce and Rey Meslas of security and the excellent restaurant staff Jirbi Sumaya and Jenny B. Zata for their care and professionalism which was memorable.

"We had a great stay at the resort. Really touched by hospitality. The beach access and quality is great, and they provide complimentary fish food on Monday, W, Friday. The downside was continuos construction which we heard from some of the rooms. Some common area facilities are a bit run down (and are under renovation). We also really enjoy the breakfast buffet at Tides (lunch there is very reasonably priced too, much better than restaurants right next to hotel - avoid those, they are tourist traps). If you make it here, make sure to venture out to Lantaw - great local restaurant on the water, worth a visit",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

We had dinner at the Cowrie Cove and the people and service were very genuine, Thanks to Mr. Dick and team! The food was great too! We had the Seafood platter and 1 soup dish.
However, the only thing that needs to improve was the breakfast. I understand that the resort was full but the services has something to do more...

The hotel is a little isolated, but it is easy to take the ¨buss¨or a taxi to mactan for some local small business and restaurants.

"The pros:
1. Food - very good choice of restaurants, good quality food (wouldn't say excellent though).
2. Atmosphere - very relaxing, quiet.
3. Grounds - lots of green areas where you can walk around in the shades or after dinner.
4. Location - close to airport, excellent views.
Cons:
1. Cost - way too expensive for the quality provided. A coconut on the beach is ~USD8, one hours massage anywhere between $100 - $150, lunch at the buffet around USD40, one dive USD 120.
2. Quality of diving equipment - since the beach and the water is mostly coral reef (beach is man-made rough sand), the best activity is snorkeling or diving. However, after I tried snorkeling, I decided not to risk it with diving - masks and snorkels were leaking, one mask fell apart in the water, etc.Besides, the visibility in the water was very poor.
3. Service is mostly very good, but some areas are lacking - for example, during breakfast and lunch the service staff at the buffet seems to be always edgy and stressed. While it is understandable that they are busy, this wasn't peak season and the line was never longer than 6-7 people and in fact no one but the staff seemed to be stressed.
4. The hotel is comparatively old and it shows in places like floor in the corridors - large and numerous stains, which I would expect a hotel charging such prices to be able and willing to clean. Some common areas places seemed outright disgusting. Room and restaurants were always spotless though.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Despite some construction work in the lobby, this hotel still tops the list of hotels in Cebu. It isn't in the center of the city, and that's a GOOD thing. The gardens are immaculate and it's lovely just taking a walk through them. Stayed here with friends and even if I am not a beach person, I still had fun with the other facilities this resort offered. We got 4 rooms (upgraded to premier, yay!) and all 8 of us had a great time. The buffet breakfast had a good variety of food though it could have been more relaxing - there were just a lot of guests over the weekend. All in all, This Shangrila did not disappoint.

"First, I would like anyone who is reading this to know some background and understand the authenticity and extremities of my case and review of this property and hotel chain. If you look at my other reviews you will see I am a well seasoned traveller - I have visited all over Europe, many top US cities and all over Thailand and Australia. I have always stayed and top rated resorts and not been disappointed too many times. I have to say that this was my first experience with Shangrila and i will not stay or recommend any of their properties. I was choosing between this and the Movenpick and if you are reading this I would recommend staying there or elsewhere on Mactan Island.

This is my story - I had my passport STOLEN in HK and therefor was not ALLOWED on the flight from HK to Philippines. I immediately contacted the hotel to let them know what had happen - I had forms and emails to prove this from the Canadian embassy and they WOULD NOT GIVE ME A REFUND OF MY $1500. I get cancellation policies, but most hotels treat this policy on a case by case example - they did not treat me as a human being who just went through tremendous stress from an incident that was out of my control. After numerous emails and calls to the hotel and travel agencies I am out of the money - i begged them to even just transfer the credit to another Shangrila location so that I could use it elsewhere in the future and they would not even do that. I have stayed at the Langham, Intercontinental, Fairmonts, Four Seasons and none of these high end luxury chains have let me down - things happen and hotels should work with you to help you have a better stay and experience.

I have never ranted about anything but I feel so strongly that I have been wronged and I want to share this so that no one else has to go through the stress and the financial loss that I have incurred.

I am a travel blogger on http://www.theitlists.com/ and will definitely be ensuring everyone knows what horrific customer service Shangila has - to think that I had my passport stolen, could not stay there and had all the proof to show them I had every intention of going and them not helping me at all and just taking all my money is ludacris.

Loved the pools especially for the kids and lifeguards were all attentive.

At first, I was hesitant to stay here as I thought the beach was small but it was actually big and a beautiful beach area. The sand wasn't powdery, it was like brown sugar which was still nice.
Snorkeling was good, fair variety of hard and soft corals.

Had a great stay here. Would come back and would definitely recommend to families and friends.

"Their beach was so beautiful that I spent most of the time hanging out there, even at night. The beach beds were so comfortable that I would snooze there at night, listen to the waves, and wait for sunrise.. before going back to the room to continue sleeping. Even without a snorkelling mask, you can see a lot of fish just by the beach, because there are corals.

The staff was very nice and attentive. I was very happy with their service.

Food and Spa services were way more expensive than outside the resort, but this is normal for big hotels. There are a lot of cheaper restaurants outside the resort, so just ask the lobby staff to get a taxi for you. A ride to the nearest mall won't cost more than USD 3 - 4.

Food at Breeze Bar was good. Waves Bar was really nice, with a very beautiful view. Rooms were good and clean, as per Shangri-La's standards.

"We stayed 19-24 Oct, wife decided to go all in and booked the Ocean Club rooms. Excellent decision on my wife's part. But Diabetics and Alcoholics should avoid booking the Ocean Club as soft drinks are free all day and alcohol is free 17:00 to 19:00. We were worried before we arrive because of the negative reviews in tripadvisor but was pleasantly surprised by everything in the hotel. It took a while at immigration control(nothing to do with the hotel) but once outside, we found the Shuttle bus in no time and was at the hotel in 20 mins. The front desk on the ground floor was busy and the staff quickly ushered us up to the ocean club for check in. They already installed an extra bed for the 4 of us so happy days.

Maybe the resort is big because whatever we do, it didn't feel crowded at all. There were plenty of room on the beach, there were usually 1 or 2 kayaks, 10 to 20 ppl max at the swimming pool, even less at the adventure zone.

Having breakfast at the Ocean Club(8/F) is a more serene and less hectic environment than at Aqua(G/F). Ocean club has a much smaller selection than Aqua but you get to order an a la carte breakfast like scrambled eggs with salmon or waffle or pancake. It is best to go to Aqua at 7:00 or 9:00 so there is no wait if you want to sit inside. And I assure you that even at 7:00 in the morning you want to sit inside. The extra selection at Aqua is mostly the juices, the noodles and the bread and pastries.

There is plenty of things to do for kids and most things I allow my 2 year old and 5 year old to do are complimentary through the Ocean Club package. e.g. kayaking(free) highly recommended to do with the kids as you can ask for fish food from the hiring desk and feed the fish in the middle of the ocean, snorkeling(free), mini putt(free) plenty of cheating needed here, 2 hours of Adventure Zone for each kid. My 2 year old was too young to play in the Adventure Zone so my 5 year old got 4 hours instead. He had so much fun with those crazy slides. Make sure you bring a long sleeves shirt and socks for the kids to play in the Adventure Zone so you don't have to buy their shirts and socks.

The food is good but quite pricey, similar to what we pay for at a nice restaurant in Hong Kong. But our friend told us there is a Spanish restaurant(Hola Espana) just outside the hotel gate and the food there is half the price of the hotel's but you are limited to Italian and Spanish food.

All the staff are very friendly and well trained to make our stay enjoyable. My son kept leaving stuff behind in the restaurant and the staff managed to find it all the time.

This is definitely a resort for a family with young kids who don't really want to venture outside and just want to play and relax and make good use of the resort. The kids had so much fun that on the second last day even they want to stay in bed and do nothing and just chill.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"Stayed for 4 nights with my fiancee in Oct. Went on a golden circle deal - book 3 nights and get a 4th free.
Ended up paying $270 US per night on average for an ocean wing room with a view of the ocean (taking into account the 4th night).

Good points
- Friendly staff in abundance who will wait on your every need
- Lovely (yet little) private beach with its own marine reserve area allowing you to swim with and feed tropical fish (so bring goggles or a scuba mask).
- 2 large outdoor pools with a play area for children, slides and a basketball net
- good selection of restaurants and bars with evening entertainment. We were fortunate to be around for the opening night of the refurbished Tides restaurant which had a fantastic complimentary buffet dinner for all guests.
- no difficulty finding a sun lounger even when we arrived late
- great buffet breakfast included in price with hardly any wait for seating (during weekdays anyway)

Cons
- The hotel is very much a resort hotel with little else to do around it i.e. you cannot take a walk outside of the hotel grounds as it isnt very safe nor attractive to do so. Compare this to resort hotels in Phuket and Bali where you have the option of walking a long length of beach of you choose or explore their cities
- Persistent faint smell of cigarette smoke coming through ventilation. Noted in 2 rooms (i upgraded the first room to a ocean view at a cost of 500php).
- Missed opportunity by the staff to help us celebrate our engagement, though i did announce it to several staff members. Im aware that nothing in life comes free, yet after a simple dinner at Abaca next door we were presented with a whole complimentary selection of desserts by the chef. Sadly no acknowledgement from the Shang.
- Cost of watersports is relatively more expensive compared to nearby seasports centres. E.g. 15mins on the jetski costs 1500php - yet outside you could get 30mins for 1900 (and could bargain down as well im sure).",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"We loved our stay at the Mactan resort - rooms were spacious and modern. Breakfast service was excellent and we had our meals at the restaurant most meals and quality were consistently high. Nothing to fault with possibly just two areas to be made. First, the resort could do with more activities as it was getting repetitive by our 3rd day there. Secondly, we would have liked more frequent shuttle into town and back (and please have a bigger bus) as there's only so much you can do at the resort too or perhaps organise alternative paid tours to nearby areas.",Food
"Pros
- This place is great. Luxury at it's best. Get a piece of paradise in Mactan? This is one of the places.
- Buffet lunch is just great. I'm not a big fan of buffets because most of the buffet food only looks good but tastes bland. But by far from my experience, nothing beats buffet lunch by shangrila hotels.
-Perfect for a family vacation. Fun fun place for family especialy for kids!
-All staff are courteous and great
-Surrounding/Cleanliness is great.
-You'll never run out of fresh towels!

Cons
- Very expensive :). Well, that is expected. But this really hurts our budget. :)
- The beach is quite artificial. You get white sands along the shore, but as you swim a little farther, it's becoming rocky and you'll see the white sand coating the natural sands of Mactan.

"We were a family of 4 plus grandparents in 2 connecting rooms, kids 5 and 8. We stayed from Oct 2 to 6.

The pros:

Staff are extremely service oriented. Kudos to mgt for recruiting well and/or training well. The staff are all very pleasant and hustle hard. At breakfast buffet, Mike was particularly welcoming.

Pools and grounds are nicely designed and the beach area, though tiny, is good enough for kids with snorkeling and kayaking just offshore.

The indoor play space is elaborate and really fun, the kids enjoyed that.

Wi-fi is really strong. Extensive coverage, you get a signal everywhere.

Located near airport so commute to and from is nice and short.

Fireworks display on 2 nights of our stay was a fun touch to the trip.

The Cons:

Seems they can't quite handle the crowd. It was impossible to find a shaded spot by poolside or on the beach. The resort should have spare umbrella stands and set up as required. No paying guest should be told, sorry no shaded spots available. We were also told 2 days in a row that they've ran out of towels and to go back 30 mins later for possibly a chance to get some clean ones.

Saving spots should not be allowed. Selfish guests would park their cheap hats and floaties to reserve spots and then proceed to breakfast. The resort should put up signs that say No reserving of chairs allowed; belongings unattended for 30 mins will be taken by pool attendants.

Back to crowd capacity, it was hard to get tables for dinner. The buffet at Buko Bar, Cowrie Cove fully booked; Acqua had long wait list. Out of our 4 nights, we had room service twice. And it was annoying because our package gave 10% off food at restaurants but not for in room dining. Ok so maybe we should have reserved a table early....but do the math, what if every paying guest calls to reserve a table early? The resort can't handle the crowd. They should have 2 seating times, 5:30 to 8 and then 8 onwards. Especially when the the hotel is at full capacity and with one of their restaurants under renovation.

At breakfast on our last day, they actually ran out of pancake batter. On one night when ordering room service, they also said no crispy pata available.

In sum, if you haven't yet been here, it's not a bad box to check, a pretty OK place especially for families. But try to avoid it during peak times because they can't handle the volume well. All the cons are fine if you're not paying a big bill, but not really acceptable given the price tag. Unlike Discovery Shores Boracay, we won't make Shangri-La Mactan a repeat destination.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Our family of 4 with young kids (ages 8 & 5) just returned. The resort is beautiful, and there are plenty of activities of the kids - they loved it! However, the service was horrible. One day we and 6 families we were with were told they were out of pizza, chicken nuggets, and light beer only to find out they weren't. Another day we waited in the E zone for an hour and a half for pizza - we were told that due to the wait we wouldn't be charged, only to find out upon check out we were charged. One evening we ordered room service (2 kids burgers, 1 pizza and a salad, plus drinks) - Pizza was delivered 20 mins after the food, were not given any glasses, ice or silverware. Called to request these items, but they were never delivered. Each evening our room was only partially serviced for turn down service. We had club access, which was overcrowded and when they ran out of something (i.e.: orange juice) their response was ""sorry we are out""...however, once mentioning that you'd like to speak with the Food & Bev Director, you'd have what you wanted. Ran out of towels at the pool often. Upon check out there were multiple charges that were inaccurate - took 45 mins to sort out.

"Pros:

Hands-down, great family-friendly hotel. Has water park-like slides, playroom, game center, and a lot of daily activities for kids. Please note: the playroom and activities cost money. Website doesn't indicate that.

Cons:

Hotel is overcrowded and there is not enough beach chairs/ pool chairs/ towels and Staff to accommodate all the guests. Can not find an empty chair by the pool for 30+ mins. If you get to the beach after 8am, there will be NO more chairs for you. Ran out of towels a few times.

There was NOT enough staff to accommodate all the guests. Had to wait for a looooong time to get poolside service and at the Buko Bar. Once you get someone though, they are very nice and professional. The tough part is to get a hold of someone....

Food at the multiple dining facilities are pricey and disappointing. The buffet dinner at the Buko Bar was not worth the $2050 per person price. They start running out of food by 8pm...and the food was mediocre at best.

Overall - it's an average hotel, below other regional Shangri-la standards, i.e. Hong Kong. It is a safe bet for first-timers to Cebu",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"If you are really set on coming to Cebu then this is the place to be.

I came here for a conference. It is very nice, but to keep your expectations in check this is not the Shangri-la experience you might be used to elsewhere.

The gardens are nice as is the pool plus beach. Rooms are ok, but I felt the the hotel is old and aged. To be fair when I was there the hotel is undergoing renovations, so no doubt things will be improved in the future.

I did manage to go visit some other hotels on the Island. Overall the quality of hotels on Cebu is not great. Really this is the best option.",Comfort & Facilities
"Very good hospitality. If given a chance I would wanted to stay long. Hope to get more room promos for my family to enjoy next time. My kids love the swimming pool park.

"I've had the pleasure of staying at the Shangri-La in Mactan on two separate occaisions and loved it. Talk about refined elegance. The staff are attentive and respectful and the setting (right on the beach), is simply superb. All the usual beach activities, from jet skiing to snorkeling, are available and the pool is quite simply the best and most beautiful I've ever seen. I simply love the place! In fact, while I was out snorkling, I even heard dolphins calling to one another! I can't wait to return!",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Stayed at this resort over the weekend to celebrate my birthday, together with my husband and two kids. I would like to say ""Thank you!"" to Nareen for upgrading us and for allowing us for an early check-in.

My kids really enjoyed the water slides and the fish feeding. Me and my husband simply like the cultural show and the acoustic band playing in their Buko Bar.

Shangrila's ever efficient staffs sets them apart from other hotels here in Cebu. From their friendly and smiling faces to their commitment to make your stay wonderful.

My family would truly cherish those memories.Thanks so much Shangri-la!",Staff:Food
"This is the best hotel because of its hospitality, service, view, and food. Every hotel staff I met in every corner..always greeted me with sincere smile.
It is also the best for its quick service.
If you stay here, don't miss the delicious food in Tea of Spring Chinese Restaurant..
I definitely will come back here..",Staff:Food:Location
"For a hefty price of P49,100 via Golden Circle, we were able to experience a 3D/2N stay in a Seaview Suite. We opted for an express check-in and expected a GRO to escort us to our room but ended up checking in via Golden Circle counter. The check-in process was a bit slow compared to properties in Makati, EDSA, Jakarta and KL. Being in a suite, we were able to enjoy snack buffet at Ocean Club Lounge (similar to Horizon Club for Shangri-La Hotels).

Now on with the good points.

We have our own two balconies, overlooking the majestic Mactan beach. Our room was huge, full of L'Occitane toiletries and has everything we need.

The employees are tourism itself (special mention to Guia ). They always smile and say ""Maayung Buntag!"" (Good Morning!). They make you feel like they genuinely want you there as if it is their home. That sets the tone.

Daily buffet breakfast is abundant, enormous, delicious, endless.

Considering the price, I don't know if I will be near this resort again in the future but it is one of the best I have ever stayed on so many levels. Maybe, if it will be your first time to experience a Shangri-La property, then you would have thought it's impeccable.",Food:Value for money

One point of comment are the lifts in the main building which not seem to work properly.

"Perfect place for families (with small kids) who like luxury, privacy, safety, and to stay within an enclosed resort in Cebu (certainly, the best in this island). Service is as usual impeccable like in any Shangri-la property. The beach is not as wide, and a bit rocky, but I am amazed with the coral farm just a few meters from the beach where you could see so many fishes of all colours and shapes, big corals and giant clams (one of the best snorkeling spots I have been to). Jetski and canoeing are also available. A must do is to book an island hopping tour/snorkeling around the area.

The rooms were also nice, well appointed and clean, and it will be good to book an ocean view room, so you can hangout in your veranda and still get a nice view. The gym was also nice, although I forgot to bring my sneakers. Good place to stay active if it is raining (especially in this season, July-Oct). And the sauna was such a good place to relax and change the pace from the beach. It was also impeccably clean and not crowded. There is also a spa center called Chi, really beautiful, but quite expensive. The cheapest is to order a massage from the gym, although rates are still high compared to the city.

There are also many activities for kids. So for parents, you have many options: 2 large pools with mini slides and fountains, huge indoor adventure place, nursery playroom,and huge video gaming room. Since it is all inside the property, it is very safe and secure.

The food quality is also very high. They have several restaurants in the property. The breakfast buffet area though is under renovation, so you can take it a makeshift tent, or better, at Aqua, near the beach. Perfect place for breakfast. Try the local suman with latik and mangoes (sticky rice with raw sugar syrup and Cebu mangoes, the sweetest in the world) with local hot chocolate. During the day, there are restaurants at the beach and poolside. In the evening, there is the Chinese restaurant, and a restobar at the beach overlooking the ocean. So, there are several options. Going out to nearby Sutukil (public wet market and restaurant) could also be an option if you want a local experience.

The only drawback is sometimes the place hosts huge conventions, and place can easily lose its 'privacy.'",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Shangri La's Mactan is a beautiful resort. The rooms are spacious, the lifts work fast, excellent wifi. The ambience of the hotel is an oasis from traffic and crowds in Cebu town. Despite the full house during my stay, you can see the F&B crew working hard to put out the meals; check-in and concierge busy with large numbers of guests checking in. Overall the hotel punches hard above its weight.

The only thing to mar it all - showers in the guest rooms were sticky and slimy. Housekeeping needs to scrub down the shower floors daily. Hmmm . . . what a shame.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Standard Shagnri-la hotel rooms, which are nice. The grounds, the pools, the beach are beautiful, the restaurants are very good.

Brings the young kids to enjoy the sun.",Food:Staff
"I had to stay in Shangri La Mactan for a conference. I stayed for a week. The Tides restaurant was under repair so breakfast was served in 2 different restaurants Aqua and the Mactan Ballroom (complimentary). The breakfast was not as good as the ones they served in Shangri-La Boracay and Makati. the breakfast was on the bland side and less choices.
One thing I notice about these Shangri-La resort hotels is that their lobby is open air (no airconditioning) which limits hanging around in the lobby for those used to warm climates although those people who love the heat would enjoy this.
The rooms were clean as expected and the amenities pretty good. Pool was clean and not as crowded. The gym was well equipted and not crowded. The beach was awesome, and strictly for hotel guests only. They had a bunch of activities they offered, jet ski, banana boats etc...
Its very close to the airport and they offer complimentary shuttles for guests.
Since I stayed for a conference on the last day of the conference the lobby can have ""ladies of the night"" if your husband goes on a trip here be scared hahaha!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Let me start with a note: our company had a regional conference during the week running up to the 2014 Ironman 70.3 Triathlon so the hotel was fully booked. Parts of it were also under renovation during our stay. These unusual circumstances may have led to my negative review.

I stayed in the Shangri-La a few times with my family when I was much younger, and have fond memories of its private beach, large swimming pools, and playgrounds for kids. Good news is that these areas are still there for families to enjoy; bad news is that there really isn't much that's new, and the overall feel of the hotel was that of an old, tired amusement park.

The rooms, along with the rest of the hotel, are to be expected of a five-star resort of the Shang's caliber, but were nothing special and may be in need of an update.

A large part of the original wing was under renovation during our stay and negatively impacted our experience. Breakfast, in particular, was horrific, with guests having to wait in line for 10-20 minutes before being seated in the ballroom which was converted into a temporary dining area. Construction noises were also audible in the conference rooms during our company's multi-day conference.

The views from Cowrie Cove were great, as was to be expected, but the food was just OK and the restaurant itself feels as dated as the rest of the resort.

Hotel and restaurant staff were very polite and helpful, but clearly a bit stretched because the hotel was fully booked. Check-in and cleaning took quite a while.

Overall, I had high hopes for our stay in the Shang, having recommended it as the venue for our company event to begin with, but was ultimately disappointed because it was not equipped to handle an event of the Ironman Cebu's magnitude without disrupting day-to-day operations.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
I highly commend the customer service shown by the breakfast buffet staff of Shangrila Mactan esp. to Guia and Jon Paul for their superb service shown. I hope other new hotels will follow suit with the way these guys exude excellent customer service from accomodating dining requests to making sure guests are satisfied with their dining experience. Totally worth the stay and food was impeccable. Thank you!,Staff:Food
"I was almost restless going crazy with massages in the spa, at the back of my head I do remember that Cebu has many surrounding islands visible from the sky. It has been 20 years since my last visit so I tried a couple of hotels. The heat was terrible, I needed to be close to the mall where I can easily buy things and get something to eat. People are nice and each has a story to tell, there were many foreigners from America, Europe, Australia, China and the most I met were Koreans, it was amazing! However, I couldn't find something that I will enjoy doing the whole day (by myself) so I tried Shangri-La. I knew that 5 star hotels are reliable and I can get my money's worth, believing that Shangri-La is best known for its hospitality! Bullseye, from the moment I laid my foot at the entrance of the hotel, I was treated like a Princess....I spent my day snorkeling (complete gear provided for less than $10)! The school of fish were magnificent, on top of that I had the spa to myself. The maids were so warm, I never felt alone, the staff were all ready to give a hand, ""selfie"" was unnecessary. The hotel provided the best food from breakfast to dinner, with cultural dances, marine sports, massages, pool by the sea, and just winding up at the gazebo was perfect. It was my first to meet Japanese guests, they truly know where to go! The hotel is a bit far from the city, I can't just walk away for some chips, but in general it provided an outstanding service that other resorts cannot beat, it's a diamond in the rough.",Food:Location
"We stayed for only 2 nights at this beautiful resort, but from the minute we arrived to the minute we left we were treated like royalty. The staff were amazingly helpful, and customer service excellent. This would have to be one of the most beautiful resorts I have ever stayed. There was some renovation happening but we barely heard any noise as the staff upgraded our room for free to keep us in a peaceful location. Rooms were a good size, food divine. A little costly but you would expect that from a 5 star resort. The beach & pools were amazing. Our little girl had so much to entertain her she actually couldn't fit it all in. We have to decided to go back in 10 days time before we fly back to Australia as the resort was that good. Only 10 mins by taxi to the airport too. Definitely put this one on your list for relaxation, family fun, rejuvenation &if you want to experience a slice of heaven.",Staff:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"I and my daughter spent a few lovely days together at the Shangri-La Mactan Resort in mid-July, 2014. The resort has been in place for a long time and some facilities including part of the lobby and Tides were under renovation, but we were not too much inconvenienced by the construction though the activity detracted from the resort atmosphere in the public areas.

The room was spacious, furnished in contemporary tropical fashion and clean. The beds were comfortable with 100% cotton bedding made of high count sheeting. The bathroom was well fitted with everything we needed. The only possible criticism was that the bathroom was dated by the tiles and grouting in the old fashioned style combination shower and bath tub. Nonetheless, it was a quiet, comfortable room.

The entire facility is wired for internet and the services are very good. The staff are friendly and helpful without being obtrusive or over eager.

The beach activities were perfect for our requirements. We enjoyed snorkeling in the ocean garden and swimming in the tropical pool. There were ample beach side umbrellas and seating. We did not feel the need to leave the resort to find a better seaside environment.

Tides was under renovation. We took our meals in Acqua where we enjoyed the Italian style food and the nice service. The menu is somewhat limited, but the food is well prepared and very good.

I would return there for a hassle free, relaxing rest. I will recommend it to my friends.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Stayed 8 days in Shangri-la Ocean club wing on the 7th floor, just below the club lounge at level 8.

How we felt:

1st theocean club room- spacious, but feels abit dated. You can hear the people walking above during the busy hours so if u intend to sleep in all the time do not stay below the lounge.

2nd- the lounge for club members. Oh my. this is the busiest lounge ever in the shangri-la i have visited! the 5pm canopes and drinks offered are not for the faint hearted! I feel that people are not there to enjoy their evenings drinks there, it felt like people were there for dinner instead??!! It is very crowded and u can hardly find a seat by 5pm in some days. The food cannot keep up with the speed and the amount of food people take! Cannot blame Shangri-la..just ugly tourist manners i suppose. Cannot commend on the food and drinks because we were only there for one night..there is plenty of good food to fill your stomach with outside of the lounge.

3- scuba dive 3 days with scotty using Nitrox. It is expensive compared to other dive operators. But you get your own boat and dive master!! that means you do not have to wait for others, especially when u have divers with varible bottom time. Went to oslob for whale shark dives- it is a must do!! once you finish diving u can shower and clean up and have a cheap BBQ lunch (20AUD for 4 pax) by the beach!!

4- How can one stayed at Shangri-la Cebu without enjoying the beach? Beach was beautiful and there is staff who helps u to get towels,life jackets etc.
For those who uses the pool often (at the ocean wing pool), there is a practice by some tourist of some countires to book the sun chairs. Apparently they come and book these chairs prior to having breakfast, then come to the pool whenever they are ready. This practice is disgusting as it deprive others the use of the chairs...they can book these chairs for hours without appearing!! Shangri-la management needs to address this. This was the biggest disappointment i have encountered during my stay. So future travellers please beware!

5- service. The staff is the true stars in making our stay wonderful! From the pool lifeguard (like evelyn), pool aid (Jessa) to club lounge staff (arpil) they are geniuely helpful, getting all what your need!! Although they deal with tough and demanding customers everyday, they are always smiling!! We would come back just for this level of service!

In short, this place has its short-comings, which could be due to the tourist. A bit of management from Shangri-la can address these issues.

P/S: tea of spring is the best resturant food we find by far. Room service is also fast (as we rang once at 4 am for our trip to oslob). the best food are found outside the hotel...we eat at fiesta resturant (outside movenpick hotel..great phillipine food!!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

Booked an Ocean Club room but disappointed with the Club Lounge. Fully packed with people and even standing room for some during cocktails time. Food replenishment cannot catch up.

We used the romantic dinner package and had a birthday celebrating dinner at the boat jetty!!
It was very special and private. Our waiter was so perfect and we really appreciated his heart-felt service. Only unfortunate thing was ongoing construction at several area in the hotel. It was not so noisy but it slightly damaged the romantic atmosphere. The private beach was incredibly beautiful. We enjoyed snorkel with lots of cute fishes.
We also experienced the hotel spa. It was also good but I think it is little bit overpriced.

"This is an absolutely great resort especially if you have children. There are so many activities for the children. We stayed in the ocean wing which includes RT to the airport. As soon as we were in baggage claim there was a gentleman in a red hotel jacket waiting for our party of 6. He immediately took our luggage and loaded the shuttle bus. It was nice to know that we were going to be taken care of. Once in the ocean wing, we were greeted by Phillip. Hands down, he has the biggest smile with a great personality to match. The hotel was extremely accomodating to make sure that my sister and I with our families had rooms next to each other with our own private entrance to the suite/end area.

The beach area is amazing with its own marine sanctuary. It was great to be able to see such a huge variety of fish and marine life in your own backyard so to speak. Jean at the watersports desk was especially friendly and willing to get us whatever we needed. I highly recommend the value vacation package which includes non motorized sports. At other resorts, there is not that much to do, but at this resort, there are many options. There are lots of staff members on the beach to help you with anything. Remember to get the fish food that the hotel provides. When you go waist high into the water and throw out the food, hundreds of small beautiful yellow with black striped fish come swimming around you. It was amazing. Some of the areas of the beach do have clear white sand areas whereas other areas have rocks and marine life. It is not all rocky.

The breakfast buffet was fantastic. We also enjoyed the cultural shows in the evenings. Tuesday was movie night, Wednesday and Friday was the Filipino cultural show and Thursday was the Polynesian show. The dance shows were first rate. Since we were there Tues-Sat, the Filipino show was repeated on Friday. It would be nice to see a different show since it is only performed two days apart. My suggestion would be to focus on three other areas of the Philippines for a different cultural show.

Everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The kids enjoyed adventure zone immensely. The pool area is set up nicely for the kids with a special small waterpark area and a slide. The grounds are well kept and beautiful.

My sister and I took a car from the hotel to visit different areas in Cebu. Junmar drove us and was extremely skilled. We traveled around Cebu for 6 hours making various stops. We felt very safe with Junmar. He was extremely polite, courteous and professional. The charge per hour is not expensive and should be considered to explore the city beyond the resort. The resort is so beautiful and relaxing, it's hard to consider leaving.

"Went to Mactan Shangrila with my husband, 7 year old and a 2 year old. It's my 4th time to stay at the resort. My kids LOVED the pool slides and the water playground. I really liked that the resort had different water features for different age groups. They had a wading pool for babies, another pool area for toddlers, and another for bigger kids and another for adults!

If you've had your fill of the sun, the pool, the beach and water activities, the hotel also has a Kids Zone which is a 3-level indoor area for bigger kids. You can leave your kids here for hours :) They also have scheduled arts and crafts for kids. A separate room for arcade and video games are also available for a small fee.

They have a different playroom specially designed for toddlers and simple art activities for kids below 3 years old. This is free :)

The hotel is very attuned to the needs of families with younger kids. When we ordered room service, they asked how many we were in the room. They provided kid-friendly utensils and cups. I found it very thoughtful!

The lines during check in time was very long...as a Golden Circle member (hotel loyalty card), we were able to check-in inside our room immediately and the hotel staff even took our family photo and sent it to us via email when we got back.

The hotel was fully booked when we stayed there and they were renovating some parts of the hotel (coffee shop, lobby). We had to have our breakfast in the ballrooms. There seemed to be a never-ending stream of hotel guest. BUT despite that, the hotel staff NEVER seemed overwhelmed and served everyone with a friendly smile and with an efficiency that is hard to find elsewhere.

From the welcome at the airport, the swift and comfortable check in, the amenities and birthday cake in the room, and so many of the staff going out of their way to make us feel special... It was just amazing.

We spent every moment of our weekend in the resort enjoying the facilities. We used the miniature golf, the regular golf, the spa, the pools, the ice cream shop, windsurfing, the fitness centre, and the restaurants of course. Everything was great, but highlights were as follows:

1. The snorkeling is breath-taking and there are so many types of colorful fish and coral just in front of the resort. Bonus was that I saw my very first live Nemo! Definitely do not miss the snorkeling!

2. Dinner at Cowrie Cove. The seafood was fresh and tasty, very well cooked, great presentation, and they have a wine buffet for 600pesos! Amazing!

3. The Ocean Wing Club. It's absolutely worth to pay the extra for this exclusive place to have a drink, snacks, and breakfast. The staff are wonderful there (especially Vanessa!) and it's the perfect place to hideout if the rain hits!

4. The fitness centre. Wow... Of course, it's a nice view to run with the ocean in the background, but the staff were just incredible. The moment I finished my workout, they were ready with a refreshing cold towel, an extra bottle of water, and a huge smile! Friendly and so helpful! They really made an impression!

"First off, I'd like to mention that I understand sometimes during high season, things can get hectic. Also, I understand if a hotel caters to group tours, it's their business so I can't tell them what to do. Having said that, the following complaints should be addressed despite these.

1. Check-in : We arrived at 2am, with 2 young kids in tow. Although there were 4 staff members working the check-in, all 4 were handling group tours. There were 2 couples in front of me, not part of a group, and we were just waiting and waiting to check-in. We could see a huge stack of passports that the group guides were checking in, and they had to call a member of the group to come and sign something etc, so it was taking forever. Please, I understand the need to cater to group tours, but at least have 1 staff member dedicated to individual guests. We ended up checking in at 3am.

2. Towels : There were 2~3 instances when at the pool or the beach, you ran out of towels, and we were told to wait 20~30 minutes until they could get new ones. Unacceptable.

3. City shuttle bus : We took the bus out to the city, and when I was making the reservations, I specifically asked 2 times when the last bus was coming back. Both times I was told 8:20 pm, but when we got there, the driver told us the last bus back was 6:20 pm. The time we arrived was 6:15 pm. Again, the staff need to know the bus times.

4. Breakfast : We were told that the regular breakfast restaurant Tides was closed to renovation. What you failed to mention was that breakfast was also served at Aqua, but we were only directed to the Grand Ballroom, which was basically a large hall converted to a breakfast place, no windows very stuffy. Why did you not mention that Aqua was open for business in the morning? Don't understand.

5. Check-out : I called ahead for someone to come and pickup our luggage. we waited 10 minutes, nobody showed up.

Walking along the stale-smelling stained carpets to the room was a bad experience already, not mentioning us opening the door to a room with an ""ocean view"" blocked by trees, and disturbed by yelling children in the pool directly below. Food at the ballroom was horrible, plus again stale-smelling carpets there put us off the already terrible buffet breakfast. Small private beach was filled with children, definitely not the place for a relaxing beach holiday. Overall, totally disappointing for Shangri-La standards.

"We visited the beautiful city of Cebu in the Philippines in May of 2009. We were on an island hopping tour with 5 other families..all relatives and Shangri-La was my families home base while in Cebu. Well let me tell you, you wouldn't want to leave the resort once you're settled in. From the look and feel of the hotel, the hotel grounds, to the service, food and cocktails, everything was first class. It can be quite and serene if you wanted it to or you can have a lively nightlife, all while staying inside the premises. It all depends on you. The place has all the amenities for a luxurious stay and all the areas you go to, be it the multiple natural and infinity pools, to spas, to the gym and restaurants were always spacious and inviting and not harried at all. They also have a disco/club like lounge at the edge of the resort that sits on a cliff overlooking the pacific ocean if you feel the need to dance and have a good time. The beach was good but not great. It's man made and it's awesome for snorkeling as the beachfront is a fish sanctuary so expect to see large schools of tropical fishes like Parrot-fish to abound. It was a memorable stay for me and a bunch of loved once. The rates are quite pricey, but you get what you pay for. We will be back!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"I have stayed in several Shangri-La hotels in the past few years and none of them prepared me for what I encountered at this one.
Within half an hour of arriving I honestly felt like I was at a Butlins Holiday Camp in the 1980s, albeit one of their posher ones. I had always considered Shangri-La to be a grown-up luxury brand but this property is quite definitely geared towards children, from the flumes and other toys in the swimming pool, the E-zone for teenagers and the fun zone for younger children. The beach too was full of activities for children.
I tried to find a sedate restaurant for dinner and failed on day one - they were all over-run with children. Day 2 I discovered Cowrie Cove which was excellent.

My room was more in line with expectations although they could do with better soundproofing on the doors as whenever a bunch of people walked along the corridor I could hear their entire conversation.

I think it is safe to say I won't be returning to this hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"When talking about Hotel and its standard; for me, nothing beat Shangri-La.

The hotel has ambiance of ""summer"" because of its aqua color which is very relaxing.

Upon checking in, hotel will offer you juice as refreshment while waiting for your turn.
The room is big enough for a couple that will stay. We received a complimentary cake for celebrating our anniversary in their hotel. The staff are very friendly and approachable.

I really enjoy their pool. The water is not that too cold. They also have kid's pool.

And the most, exciting part... the buffet breakfast! yehey!

Different cuisine was offered and its very delicious. Standards of hotel both in province and in Manila are maintained.

Tip:
Hotel offer van transfer to/from Mactan airport. It is not included upon checking in.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Everything went smoothly front airport transfer to breakfast. I just love hanging at the beach front and swimming in their crystal clear water with corals and fishes.

Food is expensive, taste is ok. There are a lot of activities for the kids. So if you're willing to splurge and you love the beach. I would recommend Shangri-la!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Very beautiful hotel with nice friendly staff, great place to snorkel. Restaurants and food is mostly ok. Morning buffet is excellent but the Italian restaurant (Acqua) has average food (food is nice and fresh and nicely served but misses any real Italian taste).
On the other hand, some points were very annoying. The hotel is under reconstruction and there are construction works undergoing in at least 3 places at the time we stay there. Service is very late. At 12.00 I had a 15 minute foot massage but at 12.15 I was still waiting> Then I went to restaurant and I had to wait 50 minutes for a pizza even though the restaurant was only 10 % occupied, Then I went to the diving instruction and again staff was 20 minutes late.
The evening buffet is a challenge because they don't have enough umbrellas so you are experience the rain and can not relax eat. I explained all these points to the manager of duty but he did not really take seriously my comments.
And there were many other small issues that were annoying. So I don't want anymore to book holidays in Shangri-La hotel in the future.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

I had dinner at the Italian restaurant Acqua, with Chef Gianfranco Pirrone, and it was superb. (The Rima Italian Restaurant in Shangri-la Boracay needs to take lessons from him). I was on business and its near to the airport but an extra drive into the city but its worth it. Get the Ocean Wing if you can. I can't say enough good things about the staff and the way its run.

We had 2 burned out ceiling lights. The bathroom sliding door was off its hinges (rollers). The electric outlets were broken or worn down from so many prior occupants trying to fit their plugs into them that 2 outlets were totally unusable. Ridiculous. The problems taken individually are small but combined they made us very annoyed and angry. We were staying at a nice hotel in Cebu and came here for the weekend, at twice the cost. Never again.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"For the price and stature one could at least expect great food. But while it's in the middle of renovations in F&B I presume they are aware of the problem and are doing something about it. The more expensive rooms are only slightly better so no need to go for that. I had expected more perks but did not get any. The age of the hotel remains visible in certain details. And even for top prices you still pay for shoe rentals at the gym--that just sucks. As a lifter I don't always wear sneakers to the gym, but that's not allowed, so you need to rent shoes. The gym was decently equipped but is one of the smallest gyms I've been to. Imagine if it had been peak season. The beach was not wide enough, watch out for the rocks in the water, and nothing is inclusive, everything will be charged: boat, canoe, surfboard, and all. Ski jets, I'd understand, but but a little kiddie peddle boat? C'mon! I wouldn't be nit-picking if I didn't know what other hotels offer for the same price. You don't even get a good view of the sunset as the hotel, get this: is on the wrong side! The hotel has not successfully integrated the local charms and does not feel exotic enough. The designers have not been creative enough from the get-go. Its only saving grace: friendly (read: REALLY friendly) staff. And if anything, I'd expect them to be slightly multi-lingual by now, but they're not. Some basic Korean lessons are in order, or at least have a few language specialists in the staff. They should also open more counters to avoid long queues. On the whole still a decent hotel, but when you charge me that much...I'll expect THAT much as well.",Staff:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"The hotel is totally false advertised. Shangri-la Cebu is not a ""paradise"" as the advertising says, but a play-land for small children. There are screaming kids everywhere. No swimming pool or areas for adults only. Even in the lounge during cocktail hours you have screaming children.

I swam every morning, it is possible until about 8:30 am, after the pools are filled with children and other beach toys. Impossible to swim or enjoy.

The staff in the lounge are super. In the rest of the hotel, the service is below average.

The hotel has no charm and is a testament to, when mass tourism at its worst. We will remember Shangri La Cebu as the most over priced place we have stayed at.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"The beach was small but had nice clear turqoise water. Lovely fishes in the sea which made snorkelling enjoyable. The property was huge and well maintained. The complimentary actitivities made the stay more interesting. The Ocean Wing room was of a decent size but nothing spectacular. The Ocean Club had a great spread for evening cocktails.

I was expecting a big ""family resort"" style level of service but truly, the staff in this property made the difference. They always greeted us with a smile and enthusiasm at every contact. They pushed this resort from a 4 to a 5 star experience.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed two nights here after three days in Cebu City and then three days in Bohol. Going from a small, quiet, peaceful resort on Panglao to this massive resort on Mactan with tons of families with kids initially took some adjusting, but I quickly liked it because of the superlative staff. They were extraordinarily friendly and helpful, especially Diana and Julie at guest services desk. Everywhere on the resort the staff greets you with a smile and hello.

I had to catch the Iloilo ferry at 7 p.m. on my last day, and they granted a late check-out at 2:00.

Even though the resort is massive, it is beautiful and well-landscaped. Although there were a lot of people staying at the resort, it didn't seem too crowded because the resort is so spacious, and it was always easy to find a place on the nice beach.

The food was excellent. I had one of the best burgers, the USA burger, ever at the pool bar, and the coconut smoothies were refreshingly good. They had a real lack of a la carte options for dinner, though, and the buffet was too expensive. I found the room service food quality to be delicious and reasonably priced.

The rooms are good but are nothing compared to the Shangri-La Boracay. Because the Mactan Shangi-La is older, the bathroom is kind of small. The furnishings were nice in the room--the older, traditional tropical Asian style with a lot of built in furnishings.

I would definitely come back, but I would recommend staying in Cebu City initially. It is a very interesting city historically, and you would want to base yourself there. Then move on to the Shangri-La in Mactan.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

Rooms: perfect! Very comfortable and personalized to guests needs. Front desk got mixed up though on the extra bed assignments.

Pool: very kid-friendly but the kids at heart enjoyed just as much.

Beach: very difficult to find a vacant cabana so grab one as soon as you see one! They give fish food if you want to feed the fish. Free snorkeling activity in the afternoon, just sign up in advance.

Breakfast: a party in my tummy every single morning.

Staff: excellent!

This resort is more for families than couples in my opinion. It is very family-oriented and has a lot of activities for kids.

Definitely a trip for the books!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
Everyone's always smiling and greeting you; and the staff were always willing to help with anything you asked of them. We had a great stay. Great for families too.

"This is my idea of a perfect break after some hard core work.

Relax: The private beach pacific blue and is equipped with life jackets, keenly observing life guards, and an easy going snorkeling experience.
The pools are spacious well maintained, pretty and serve pretty delicious cocktails.
The spa promises to make you forget your worries and teh sound of the waves shall allure you to chill like a villain.

Stay: Clean spacious rooms. twice a day turn down services, happy helpful and alert staff.

Activities: #Scotty's Dive Centre - They managed to get me my 4 dives. My highlight of this trip was swimming with the Whale Sharks in Oslob! I still cant get over it... I am bobbing in pure unadulterated joy. (Although I do believe they are a tad bit expensive).
Loads of sea sport activities here... a large menu to chose from.

The 4 day getaway to Cebu and stay in Shangri-la can be rated as one of my happy puppy trips this year.

Don't expect too much action in this city its quiet and you need to chill soak in the blue and go back home a calmer soul.

"Cebu is my favorite city in the Philippines, and I have been there many times, but I usually stay at much simpler digs and I'm used to everyday life among the Cebuanos. I ended up at the Shangri-La with family. I flew in from Manila and got to the resort a few hours after my family arrived.

The Shangri-La pickup process at the airport was efficient and while I had to wait longer for the van than the trip would've been by taxi, it was complimentary. Again, I'm used to taking cabs and Cebuano taxi drivers are known for their honesty, especially compared to their Manila counterparts, but for the newbie to Cebu or the resort-style tourist, I guess this matters.

My family told me they had to request room changes twice because of a strong smell of mold in the first two rooms--this seems to be standard at beach resorts throughout Asia, since people leave their balcony doors open and the humid air hits the cold, air conditioned room and condensation gets everywhere.

They finally got an acceptable room just before I arrived.

The hotel was packed with tourists in late May/June. Getting a table at breakfast was a chore and on one morning they even had to open up a ballroom of sorts for the overflow from Aqua! Cebuanos are known for their hospitable natures and this was true at the Shangri-La for sure, where everything was taken care of smoothly, despite the sheer volume of guests.

One on morning the watermelon juice that was served at Aqua was off...really off...but other than that I felt the food and service was perfectly acceptable at all of the establishments we dined at. I also felt the coffee served at breakfast was subpar, but this is par for course at larger hotel chains around the world, so I wasn't too surprised.

I personally would not stay at the Shangri-La again, primarily because of the sheer volume of guests, and also because I prefer to spend most of my time outside of my hotel when I'm in Cebu, but if I was looking for the resort experience, there are hundreds of options in Cebu and on neighboring islands to consider. That being said, the Shangri-La and its staff do an incredible job, and must be commended for it. Daghang salamat gud!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I always wanted to back here and I took the chance when I went to Cebu to attend my friend's wedding. The day after the wedding, I checked out from our hotel where we stayed for the wedding and transferred to Shangri-la. All the hotel staffs were amazing, accommodating and very polite. We spent our time together at the beach relaxing whole day. We love the buffet dinner at Buko Bar along with the program that night. We were just missing the breakfast buffet that we really long for and one of the reasons why we really wanted to be back. Bad timing that Tides is under renovation during our visit. All in all, we enjoyed our stay and will definitely come back for more. Cheers to this great hotel!",Staff:Food
"This hotel is HUGE. The resort is in itself, a vacation area that you need to devote time, to explore the amenities this hotel offers. Get this hotel if you plan to spend time in the resort (and not go downtime most of the time). If your visit is to tour the whole of Cebu proper and the adjacent towns, it's probably better to get a hotel outside Mactan.

Shangrila Mactan, as written, is a big resort. I only stayed a few days but I didn't spend much time in the hotel resort, as I was always out and touring the city. I will recommend this hotel - very luxurious and great beach area (though not that big as you can see from the pics that I posted.

The hotel rooms however, I wasn't too impressed. I didn't have a good picture of it, so I decided not to post one. Overall, great hotel, attentive staff and possibly the best resort in Mactan.",Food:Location

We went at a time when there were school holidays in Korea, hence a lot of tourists hopping over from there with children. Thought it would be quieter when I had booked it, simply because it was our honeymoon. The only time this was a problem at all was at breakfast really, where it got extremely busy with children running all over the place, but credit to the staff, they maintained standards.

Great trips from here to waterfalls etc. Although these tours were very expensive, hence I have docked them their 5/5 review.

Mini golf, table tennis etc was a lot of fun.

Their spa, I would say is the best in the world (well at least from what I have seen).

+ Beach is great for little kids to play, explore and see the sea life
+ Staff were always great, very friendly and helpful and made us feel welcome
+ Kids club and indoor play area is a great break from the heat and a nice break for parents!
+ Lots more to be honest but I'd be here all day, food was very nice of course

- Given the cost of the hotel overall I felt they charged a little too often for peripherals in the resort, I can hardly think of a single thing we did outside of swimming in the pool/sea that didn't incur some type of charge. Example having to pay 700PHP to play mini golf with a 4 year old seems a little much to me, and that's just one example among many....
- One restaurant in the main wing was being refurbished during our stay and this made the breakfast buffet extremely crowded with long queues to wait for a table

We had stayed at the Ocean Panorama Suite at the Ocean Wing and availed of the Club level (includes daily buffet breakfast, evening cocktails and all-day beverages/snacks). Everything was heavenly. The hotel room was clean, beautifully designed and spacious. The balcony was spacious as well with gorgeous sweeping views of the ocean. Bottled water was included and I can ask for more. The staff were very helpful and courteous, and prompt when I request for something. The pools were varied and perfect for all ages since there was a pool appropriate for adults, a pool appropriate for small children and another appropriate for older children. There was so much to do for everyone. I loved the beach - the water temperature was just right, there were shady rock formations which I stayed near at when I felt hot, and I was practically swimming with colorful fish since there was a marine sanctuary there. Helmet diving was absolutely awesome. There were more fish and coral underneath and no skill was required. The staff there were very helpful and aided me in taking pictures of the corals and fish. My husband and I loved the spa as well. The restaurants had great food and some, such as Cowrie Cove, offers beautiful ocean views (as long as you get there before dark). This is such a great resort. This is highly recommended. Shangri-La had exceeded my expectations once again.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Overall this was a very good hotel with really friendly and helpful staff. We were travelling with a 17 month old child, and the facilities for kids was brilliant - large pool area for kids; lots of beach toys you can borrow; soft play for babies and toddlers, and there were other play areas and activities available for older children; a varied menu in their restaurants for children, plus they tend to accommodate your wishes if you want something that's not on the menu for kids. We stayed in a family room which was ideal for us as it meant once our son was asleep we could enjoy watching a film in the living area without disturbing our son. The staff were super friendly, attentive and helpful throughout our stay.
The live music in the evenings can be quite loud, and goes on until midnight, and as our room was overlooking the area where the band was playing we did call reception to let them know of the disturbance. I didn't think they would actually do anything about the loudness of the music, but they did, and they even offered us another room in a quieter location (although we decided not to switch rooms as ours was nicer and bigger).
The gym was good and well equipped. The spa was really nice, and located to the side of the resort where it's peaceful. The beach was clean, and they had lots of sun loungers. Staff on the beach were always on hand when we arrived to give us towels and set them up on our sun loungers, and they always gave us lots of beach toys for our son to use.
We dined at a few of the restaurants there, and they were all really good. I didn't think the buffet at the main restaurant was value for money, but only because I felt the food at their other restaurants were better and also worked out cheaper. The buffet breakfast was varied, so there was always something to please everyone.
A really good choice if you're holidaying with children, but I would not recommend staying here if you don't have kids.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"My second stay in Shangri-la Mactan came in the most unexpected situation. On November 7, we were staying in a different hotel in Cebu city, and it so happened that I took my family with me because we planned on celebrating my daughter's first birthday at Shangri-la since I'm in Cebu for work anyway. The next day we were suppose to transfer to Shangri-la, we had a reservation and everything was in order except for the impending super typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). Everything was calm the day before. At around 8 am Cebu time, the impact of the super typhoon started to be felt and I started to worry whether or not we could change hotels. The hotel lobby started to be filled with people and I asked the front desk if we could extend our stay since the weather has gone from bad to worse. To sum-up this story, we couldn't stay and left with an option to cramp in a hotel lobby with no food or water or try to transfer despite the bad weather. I called Shangri-la and they advised us that we will be welcomed for as long as we can make it to their hotel. We manage to find a taxi who's willing to take us there, we didn't know that the weather has further worsened, at the gate of Shangri-la, fallen trees was all over the place and the guard told us that it was not passable and that the hotel had closed. I told them that we had no place to stay and that I spoke to a person in the hotel already about our coming. The guards talked among themselves, relayed their concern over their handheld radios and eventually help us in by clearing the service road filled with debris while the wind was howling and the rain pouring from different directions. The front desk was closed and we had to use the staff entrance just to get in. We were immediately ushered to our room and made all the obligatory check-in requirements in our room. I am extremely grateful to Shangri-la for accommodating us despite the insurmountable odds. The next day, they managed to clear all the debris and any visible effects of the typhoon was gone. We stayed in the hotel for a few more days and we had electricity and internet the whole time, when many parts of Cebu city didn't. It was a true test of service and I'm glad we chose Shangri-la.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed at the Ocean Club Room during our stay and I must say that it is the best and the only way to enjoy the resort with all the perks thrown at the guests.

First off, check-in was shall I say... the best one I have experienced yet. In-room check-in and check-out. Picture this... You arrive at the front desk, if there are a lot of guests you just tell them that you are and ocean club room guests and you will be given your room keys in a couple of minutes and be told that you can wait at your room as someone will go there to process your check-in details. How cool is that?

Next comes the 11am-2pm snack time. Drink all you can of sodas, juices, coffee, tea and water. Eat all you can from crackers, to pastries, to fruits.

Then comes the best... 5pm-7pm cocktail hour. Drink all you can now includes alcoholic beverages from wines to whiskeys to gin and vodka. Then a variety of hors d' oeuvres and yakitori, a variety of cheeses along with rolls and crackers. You never even have to go out for dinner.

The room is good but the bathroom is not quite that interesting. Maybe because they haven't renovated it yet as the resort is in the process of renovation.

As an Ocean Club guest, you also get unlimited free access to all non-motorized water sport facilities. Some things you can do with their spa and mini golf course.

"My husband was in Cebu on business and I was able to get away with him and stay at the Shangri-La here in Cebu. The hotel grounds are absolutely beautiful and are constantly being groomed and cared for. The staff are very friendly and try to anticipate any possible need and take care of it with a smile and a genuinely caring attitude. I saw staff taking care of problems or issues that weren't necessarily part of their job description -- they just saw a need and took care of it and didn't waste time trying to find someone else to do it. The physical setting on the beach is fantastic - there are tropical fish within the first 10 yards of shore, and they get more and more plentiful as you progress further out over the coral. It quickly progresses to more than 20 feet deep of clear water, and there are lifeguards and support persons not only on shore but also stationed in a small boat out in the swimming area. I was only here one night and day but was able to take advantage of the beach and snorkeling as well as some pool time - I can see why my friends with families absolutely love it here. The family pool has many different offerings of water play equipment like slides and water cannons; it has shallow areas and deeper areas with plenty of room to play; and it also offers games like mini-golf and pool tables and ping-pong to satisfy even those who don't like the pool.

The pools were awesome, but what impressed me most was the snorkelling! The snorkelling was easy and safe! The fishes were plenty to satisfy me, the jaded scuba diver! I felt safe for my 10-year son as there were watchful lifeguards along the beach. I love how the resort provided life vests for everyone and the lifeguards reminded everyone to do them. The staff provided ice cold water without us asking. Great, great service. The beach swim was safe, slight current but otherwise very enjoyable swim.

I did 2 dives with Scotty's. Not great diving but good enough for me! Cost me 7000 pesos.

Buffet breakfast was lacklustre. You see the same items everyday!

We had our first 2 lunches at the bar, pizza is good, but rather steep. The following day, we took the taxi to downtown. Even though the taxi fare cost 250 Peso each way, it is still cheaper for us to have our meals at the mall then to have it at the resort.

Another sore point is the 150 Peso for the shuttle to downtown. Rather expensive!

"We stayed with our 2 year old daughter during the Easter holidays and I was a bit apprehensive that service levels will go down because of how busy it gets this time but my fears were unfounded. The service was still as good, friendly and efficient. The only downside of being at peak season was that the beach was quite full and it was hard to get a free spot in the umbrellas or cabanas. However elsewhere in the resort it did not feel crowded at all and we had pleasant meals in every restaurant we went.

The resort really is a family friendly paradise for young children and our daughter had a great time in the pool and play area. I wouldn't recommend it for couples looking for a romantic holiday though, as screeching children everywhere tends to ruin the romantic mood! ;)

We stayed at a one bedroom suite which had an amazing balcony and views over the beach and ocean. It was a good room except that the sofa in the living area was quite firm and uncomfortable and the curtains and roman shades are getting old and need updating since the 'black out' function was not that good anymore, it was quite bright so a bit difficult to put my daughter down for a nap. I may have to bring my travel black out blinds in the future when we go back.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"We'd stayed in Shangri-la mactan around 6 times already, the last being 2 years ago and the kids were all excited to return. We were a little let down when we got to our room at 2:30 and the adjoining room wasn't ready, there was only one pair of slippers for both rooms and no room service menu in either room. The handle to the closet in one room was also coming off already and we had to call housekeeping to fix it. The breakfast the following day was a bit underwhelming as well, maybe partly because the breakfast buffet at Marco Polo hotel in Cebu, where we had stayed overnight prior to coming to Shang, was very good. There weren't as many choices and because the Tides is under renovation, breakfast was served for all the guests at the main ballroom, that they had converted to a dining area. I don't know if we had availed of a different package before, but I wondered why now we were only entitled to use 2 sets of snorkeling gear for 1 hour each for each room, even if were staying for 2 nights and 3 days, whereas I think there was unlimited use of these before. Plus now you have to pay to play any of the games, even badminton and table tennis.
There were still pleasant memorable points. The beach is still a lot of fun, especially the fish feeding for the kids. The view from our rooms was spectacular, and the service, as can be expected from a Shangri-la hotel was very good. I just wish we could still get as much fun for the premium that we pay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"The resort has a very relaxing atmosphere with a lot of wide spaces, open areas, trees and wonderful landscaping. I guess the only distracting thing is the on going renovation of Tides. Aside from that, it felt awesome exploring the resort grounds and the beach.

We were billeted at an ocean view room at the club level of the ocean wing. The room was very spacious with traditional Filipino accents which gave the room a resort like feel. It also has a magnificent view of the beach and sea. I enjoyed waking up at 5:30 in the morning everyday just to watch the sun rise from the horizon.

Breakfast was served at the Mactan Ballroom, Acqua and the Ocean Club Lounge. We were very pleased with the food options and had difficulty of not overeating. We specially loved the mangoes and the suman with latik. The corned beef and danggit were also very nice.

The resort had several activities scheduled daily catered for their guests. We attended the basic scuba for beginners which was held on the main pool. Other activities we had were snorkelling, kayaking, get skiing, table tennis and games at the ezone.

I wanted to give the resort 5/5 rating but we experienced a few hiccups. I wish the resort management would work on making sure that pre arranged requests were taken cared of, cleanliness of the pools and bathroom and educating guests on the proper attire at their restaurants and ocean club lounge.

I would still recommend the resort to friends but would tell them not to expect everything to be perfect.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

They are the friendliest I have ever met without bordering on being over acting. They are genuinely nice and helpful. They really went out of their way to make our stay memorable. And it truly was!

We were not very mindful of the schedules of activities (we came always at the vey last minute), but we were still accommodated with topnotch hospitality. Kuya Jorly, the garden tour guide, was very patient in answering our questions. Ms. Guia, the breakfast ambassador, was the epitome of good service. As the breakfast station was about to close, she went to our table and offered us the best Filipino desserts which we failed to notice in the tables. She also explained the membership rewards card for loyal customers, which interested us to avail of the same. Our last 30 minutes in the Mactan Ballroom with Ms. Guia were probably the most enjoyable part of breakfast.

"We stayed here at the end of January.

I was still very happy with the rooms & the hotel. Its quite pricey but you really get what you pay for.

We were on the first floor of the ocean wing. Very accessible to the pools, beach area and breakfast area as well.

Rooms were great as usual. Bathroom was great with complimentary l'occitane toiletries everyday =)

Breakfast in the main restaurant was so packed and busy, but food was still well stocked.You can try to have breakfast in the area near the pool but variety is less.

The check in counter seemed to be overwhelmed by the guests. Having been around for quite a while, I expected them to deal with this better. When we arrived, there was a long line, and after waiting for 30 mins, we decided to step out for lunch. They already told us that our rooms will be ready at 1pm. During lunch they called to inform us that our rooms were ready. When we got back, there was still a line and we had line up again. They made us wait again. Guests who had just arrived got rooms ahead of us. In the end, it was okay. The room they gave us was great.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"My wife and I stayed at the Shangri-La Mactan Island Resort Apr 25th through Apr 29th.

This was a tough one to rate. The grounds are impeccable and world class. The service was excellent, quick, and served with a smile. the facilities, grounds and service was so great that I gave the resort 3 stars instead of 2.

That being said, there were a many problems my wife and I encountered on our trip. Firstly, at the airport we were made to wait 45 minutes to be picked up by the hotel airport shuttle because the first one was filled. We called several days and confirmed our need for an airport shuttle with the hotel. There is nothing ""luxurious"" about waiting in 35 degree heat for a second shuttle because of poor management. Strike one

Next, this is not where you want to bring your wife/fiancee/girlfriend for a romantic getaway. This seems to be a strictly family oriented place, which is not bad if that is what you want. However, this was our anniversary and it really was hard to feel romantic when we were one of the few patrons who were not wearing flip flops, board shorts, and wet suits to dinner at their ""classy"" Italian resto. A dress code would be nice, but not economically feasible seeing as we were one of the few people that actually dressed like we were going to a nice restaurant.

thirdly, After taking a day trip into Cebu City and being charged for the shuttle service(Charging for the shuttle service? Stay classy, Shangri-La!). We returned at around 1530, we decided to rest for a little before going to the pool. as we got close to the bed, both of us smelled an incredibly foul odor, something akin to week old gym socks. upon closer investigation, we discovered it was our ""fresh"" sheets! We called the front desk immediately and it was quickly taken care of, but once again, not what I would expect from a ""luxury"" resort.

Also, the place was packed, it was almost impossible to find 2 sun chairs by the pool. We also had to wait 20 to 30 minutes to be seated for breakfast every morning which was annoying. Now If I were a betting man, I would put all my chips on the overcrowded as the root cause for all our problems. So if you plan on going here, I would try to go during the weekdays, and not the weekends when the place is an absolute madhouse.

All and all, I would never come back to this resort, while the grounds are beautiful, the sheer size of it is just too big and a certain quality and luxury is lost due to it. It felt more like a business retreat or a day camp than it did a resort.

For inquiring minds, our anniversary was not ruined, we found a lovely resto down the road at the Abaca resort and were able to have a wonderful night! Maybe Shangri-La Mactan Island can learn a thing or two from their neighbors at Abaca!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Having stayed at many Shangrila group hotels, the one thing that differentiates this resort is the staff. They smiled and greeted at every opportunity possible. You really felt welcomed and that they are willing to help.

The rooms are large. Although the bathrooms are renovated the bathtub shower setup is inconvenient. If you want to use te deluxe room work station then this can be inconvenient also. My guess that you should skip business and enjoy the resort.

The resort offers so much. Many restaurants. Many pools. Lots of beach space to enjoy the ocean and tanning. Snorkeling at the resorts doorstep. Even a bar restaurant overlooking the ocean. I saw massage beds overlooking the ocean too. Breakfast is nice with huge variety. This place is just wonderful. There's a gym and kids day care.

All this comes at a price. But it's worth the price. Therefore do not expect a budget holiday but do spend and enjoy. With my business trip over I look forward to a holiday in Cebu soon. Huge resort so be prepared to enjoy the walks. Nothing much nearby but shangrila mactan offers enough for a short or long stay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

"The Shangri La Mactan is a great 5 star resort in beautiful surroundings and a superb private beach and marine sanctuary. There are plenty of activities for the kids both outside and inside with several activities laid on. In fact, in 3 days visiting our 7 year old and 5 year old didn't get bored once, which is always a challenge for parents.
Our eldest daughter is Coeliac and so can't eat any gluten. We informed the hotel and they had each if the restaurants notified in advance of our arrival. One of the restaurants even made a cake specially for her which she loved. We can't thank them enough for that as it really made her evening and ours.
The private marine sanctuary is really excellent. Traveling out a few meters with a snorkel you can see plenty of marine life up close and life jackets are provided for everyone's use so even inexperienced swimmers or those with a fear of water can feel safe and comfortable.
It's probably not the place to go if you are looking for lively night life but it comes highly recommended for everyone else",Food:Staff:Location

We never ran out of activities that would fill our day....basking under the sun, snorkeling and kayaking, foodtripping, ziplining, and of course, going to Chi for the massage. Ocean Wing rooms will give you the added premium as proximity to the beach and Ocean Wing pools, size of the rooms were just perfect. The hotel offers shuttle service to the city at a price and fixed sched but it is also convenient enough to hire a taxi. Being a local, it is a bonus as Shangrila offers promotional 'Paradise Rush' vouchers usually in time for summer, which i get, to get good accommodation and dining deals.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Shangri-La Mactan is set amidst a beautiful landscape, much to the delight of my 5 year old who exclaimed excitedly that the resort was ""perfect"" when we arrived. Service was mostly excellent - check in staff and concierge were clear, understanding and helpful. Aqua's manager was always checking with us on our dining experience (thank you!) and we love the food at Aqua. Breakfast buffet was always something our family looked forward.

We didn't opt for the buffet dinners as buffets were way too much for us with so much feasting throughout the day. A nice and chic Spanish Restaurant and a Korean Restaurant just outside the resort makes good alternative options on days we do not fancy eating in the resort. We really enjoyed the Spanish food at the restaurant located just outside the resort (especially the squid ink paella).

My kids really enjoyed themselves in the Adventure Zone and had lots of fun with their craft activities. The staff at Adventure Zone were most accommodating. We really appreciated the way they took care of our kids.

However, I was a little annoyed when our room phone went dead one morning and the staff at the Adventure Zone was unable to contact us when our child fell and bumped her head in the play zone. As a result, we were unable to attend to her when she was hurt. We feedback to the staff who said they would look into it. It would have been nice if we were to be followed up by the manager about our feedback.

We love the private beach and the lovely waters. We had a good snack and drinks at the bar by the beach as well. *thumbs up*

There is a wide choice of restaurant with the Italian offering particularly fine fare. The rooms are good for this type of holiday, the breakfast is brilliant and the staff extremely helpful. There is a bus to visit the town with its enormous malls which might be heaven for those who like to shop but can quickly become a nightmare for those who do not. We took a seacat from Cebu to Bohol to avoid flying to Manila and then back out again. The tickets must be bought prior to travel in the mall but otherwise the service was fast and efficient.

"Joined my husband for 4 nights since he had a conference on-site. I just wanted to relax away from the city. We had an ocean view room. As with all Shangrilas, the room was well furnished, with global and local touches. I most enjoyed the expansive and open, white-washed architecture of the resort which afforded sights of greenery and sky as much as possible. Exiting your room didn't mean a closed-in hallway, but the smell of the sea and a view of the greens and amenities. There was a children's activity area which we checked out for a future visit with our little one. We booked a couple massage at the Chi spa using his golden circles membership. Worth it. We also made sure to find time to snorkel with the resident guide to view the reef conservation project, a short swim off the beach. It's been so long since I put fins on my feet (I'm a PADI Advanced Plus diver, from years back) so it was a very pleasant ""baby"" step back, revisiting a past hobby.
A highlight of our lounging at the beach area was bumping into my hubby's Singaporean cohort (from 12 years back, at a master in laws program in the US East Coast) and her family- they were escaping from the terrible haze polluting Singapore's sky from a Malaysian forest fire. Since the Shang resort grounds were large, we never felt overcrowded...except at breakfast. It is just impossible I suppose for them to accommodate all the guests for the breakfast buffet with the limited seating available at their cafe. Truly, in a 5* like the Shang an unsettling occurrence. My hubby and I really enjoyed our after dinner drinks and snacks at the main lounge area. We sat facing the night sky, away from the live band and the mid-evening crowd. It was showering and there was a light breeze, so it was a most pleasant experience.

Try the couple's spa, it may be pricey but it is worth the money. The breakfast buffet is great too but the place can be crowded.

"We went here after being told by friends that this is the best place to stay in Cebu. Which may be true. We paid a pretty steep price for the room - serves us right going over Easter holidays. The room was fine - nothing special.

Let me start with the positive. The staff was very well trained and all of them offered service with a smile. I think this reflects the culture of the chain.

We never left the resort. Most of the time, we spent in the pool or on the beach. Beach does tend to get crowded. Pool side seating is scarce - a lot of people go early and ""reserve"" pool chairs. There are 2 pools - one of which has a slide - which our kids loved. So we spent most of our time there. There is also an adventure zone there - which our kids used a couple of times. We never used the e-zone (games and such). They do have a set of activities daily that are free - which is cool - but outside of that, you get charged for everything. I recommend the free snorkeling activity - the fish are right on the beach and you can literally be waist deep in water and see them. Our family did the parasailing - which was executed very professionally (take off and landing directly on boat) and the kids loved that. I have heard good things about the paid snorkeling activity - it is a marine reserve - but we didn't get to do it due to weather.

Food was disappointing. Breakfast at Tides was buffet - and was ok. Gets super crowded. For dinner - we tried a la carte and buffet - and both of them were blah. We also ate at Acqua - their italian restaurant - and this was better than Tides in terms of food (IMO). That said, for a hotel of this stature and for the prices we paid, I was expecting to be blown away by the cuisine. Sadly, I left underwhelmed.

Overall, I thought the place was ok. We had a good time, but I think that we would have anyway if it was any other place with a pool and beach access. I personally cannot reconcile the price we paid to the value we got - especially given the expectations we had of the Shangri La.",Food:Value for money

"That was literally what I experienced when I stayed here for the Easter weekend. I heard that the hotel is kids friendly but it was in my face. Kids were everywhere and so are their toys which includes all sort of inflatables and sand castle building tools. It is really great for families but adults who wants privacy, forget it.

The property is huge and I wish there is an adult only section. I am sure some parents don't mind having some quiet moment. The other negative about this resort is that it's showing its age. Can use an updating to their rooms. Having been to all the newest hotels in Asia, this is not 5 stars. Having said all that, I have no other complaint. The service is flawless. The staff are very friendly. That is our saving grace for this trip. If you're w kids, it's a perfect resort.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We spent our 19th wedding anniversary here and honestly it was the most enjoyable and memorable wedding anniversary celebration. Upon arrival, we were greeted with smiling and courteous staff. The resort lobby is big, interior design is nice and the rooms are bigger than the other hotels and resorts we have stayed. The place is truly is an ideal place to relax - there are loves of trees and the greens around the resort, there are swimming pool choices for adults and kids, they have sports amenities too like table tennis, golf course and boxing punching/kicking bag. You should not missed exploring their marine sanctuary whenever you’re in Shangrila Mactan. We spent half a day feeding the fish and swimming . Food buffet are excellent with lots of choices from western, Asian , Korean and Filipino foods. You can have your breakfast in either Tides or Acqua. The former has more food choices and the latter has better view, fewer people but fewer choices. We stayed late at night because we enjoyed the live band entertainment at the lobby.

"Stayed at an Ocean Club room first week of April. Since generally reviews are positive, expectations are already high at the onset add to the fact that we planned to have a great time as a family. The amenities excellently delivered. A little downside were experienced in the service. There were inconsistencies on the kind of de luxe service you expect in a supposedly deluxe resort. Most personnel are great and exceeded my expectations but tarnished by some very laid back and unpleasant staff. Most notably, I did not take well the electronic communications I had with their reservations team prior and after my visit, I find them insincere bordering to insensitive, not pleasant at all. Overall my family enjoyed and will definitely look forward to go back hoping that these unseen personnel on the reservations give the courtesy we expect and I strongly think we deserve.",Staff

Food was great. The Italian restaurant served great food. Though the choices is quite limited. The Chinese restaurant was good. Ended up eating there most of the time. The pregnant lady and Belle was superb in their service. They remembered exactly what we ordered the day before and were able to recommend dishes. The seafood restaurant was disappointing. The food was expensive and not very good. But the ambience is good as one gets to dine next to the beach.
Staff
Staff at the Ocean Wing lobby were well trained. They were very attentive and will try their best to accede to your every request. I am impressed.
Room
We stayed at Panaromic Ocean Wing Room. View was fantastic. Room was clean. Bathrooms were abit old but very clean.
Sea
The sea was awesome. There were corals and many fishes just off the shore of the hotel. They even had 2 giant clams but most of the corals were hard corals. The sea water is very clean and nice.
CSR
We visited an orphanage recommended b y the hotel. The hotel has a very good CSR programme. We went pick up lots and lots of grocery before heading to the orphanage. It was a great experience and my children learnt a lot during the trip. Kudos to the hotel for having such a programme. I will definitely come back next year and visit again.

Kids had a blast of time at the adventure zone. Kids need long sleeve shirt to be in there to play. There is a huge slide that goes almost vertical. The service staff there was good and very attentive. Left our kids there and went for a spa.
We have been to many 5 star beach resorts around the region. Shangrila Mactan definitely ranks amongst the top few. We will be back!",Food:Location:Staff
"...to just have a holiday or meeting, like we had.

We arrived at the airport, all 20 of us to join other groups at the hotel for a meeting. Straight off, things were looking good with hotel reps clearly identifying themselves and sorting out our luggage and ourselves.

Arrival & check in at the hotel was the most easy I have ever experienced with us being whisked away from the other guests and into our own meeting place for registration, of course, with the attending mango juice. In 10 minutes, the whole group were being shown their rooms to freshen up and explore.

I must say, with the meeting times, we took a few days to explore the hotel with its many activities.

Lets start with the room. I had a garden (I think) facing room with a balcony. I think all rooms have balconies, but I may be wrong. I'm looking right at what seems like a nursery and the aircraft flight path. Not noisy though. Room was well appointed and if anyone has read my reviews, my pet hate is slow connection and lack of power points. My room had great connection speed and enough points, international points, I might add, so these deserve AAA rating. Bed was good as were the pillows. No stiff neck during the whole week. TV is LCD and enables me to hook up my hard drive to watch movies. bathroom amenities were more than adequate, although I usually bring my own stuff. Cleaners were very attentive and knew what to do. Good job there.

We only had breakfast at the outlets like Tides and Acqua, lunch being catered in a ballroom for us. Dinner is when we would go out and try the local fare. Breakfast, no drama. Has enough to cater for many tastes and what is there is all very palatable. Restaurant staff, like all staff elsewhere in the hotel were above par.

Catered lunch was good buffet as were the coffee breaks. I have to thank Demi & Paul for making the breaks enjoyable. They remembered how I liked my coffee exactly!!

On the subject of food, we had a gala dinner by the beach and food was great. I'm not a fussy eater, but I don't take too much. However, I found myself going back for more and more and more, tiny portions of course, it all adds up.

Activities? Anything you need....swimming, gym, spa, snorkelling, whatever....all catered for. My kids didn't want to leave even after a week.

Great live band as well, if I may add.

But as with any good hotel, staff is always the ones making the difference. This place has great people working there and they make our stay enjoyable, very enjoyable.

Would I return? You bet. My 3 year old is asking if we could have a holiday there again.

If you're the type to stay in a resort and make use of the facilities, the Shangri-La Mactan is a good place to do it. However, if you also like to explore the surroundings and get a bit of shopping done in modern malls, you'll find that its a bit far from those kind of places, like I did. But even then, the resort was lovely, the weather kind and the people more so.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"we dropped by here on our way to oslob and ended up not wanting to leave as the place was like paradise. all the staff will never fail to greet you anywhere and any time you see them! super-friendly! you can see that they treasure service as they are hundreds of employees all serving you with a smiling face. all hotels should make shangri-la mactan a golden standard for service. we stayed at the ocean wing and at first we got disappointed because the view was a bunch of trees and a cemented road. the hotel was fully booked that day so we didn't have the chance to move. anyway, the room view will not really matter once you get to experience shangrila. amenities were awesome, just check out their website and all you can see there are true and more. each day they have a schedule for yoga, zumba, hikes and other stuff you can think of - its there. no, literally and i'm not kidding, everything you can think of. haha. we want to live here. all our friends tell us how beautiful it is here and now that we have experienced it, we just want to tell everybody how perfect this place is. now we understand why people stay here for weeks. prepare to be amazed. worth every penny. by far the most complete resort hotel we've stayed in the Philippines. a good upgrade would be if they have a bidet and a separate shower enclosure.

"We stayed at Shangrila hotel on our vacation is CEbu. The place is perfect, the food and everything was perfect on our stay in cebu, My family really enjoyed a lot, we went snorkling with the whalesharks, visited the cascading waterfalls and get amazed with the beauty of BOhol, We had Cebu Exclusive Holiday arranged our tour for us and everything was really awesome. Filipinos are really great no wonder lots of tourist keep on coming back in the Philippines! Perfect Vacation!",Location:Staff:Food
"Excellent location, with an outstanding beach, marine reserve, and excellent range of facilities. The staff are uniformly well trained, courteous, and smiling. The Ocean Wing is not as exclusive as it claims and our stay was slightly marred by the overcrowding of the Club lounge with too many noisy and unruly children. Many parents buy their way into the lounge to avoid paying for dinner!",Staff:Location:Food
"Always invariably friendly Shangri-La will wind you want
Gold card application, but didn't make a lot of points issued Oh a break
I thought the breakfast was nice upgrade than the last one
However, the beach bar is the renovation was too bad
It was remodeled in transition
You will need to ponder seems to be
Many had little Korean restaurant for Korea ...",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We had been traveling for nearly five weeks and this was a nice ending. The Resort is beautiful and the restaurants are good. It really is perfect for families but not that much to do on this Island if you are an older, still romantic couple. We had dinner on the beach one night, the beach barbeque, it was good, we ate at the Cowerie Cove, that was romantic! But our favorite dinner was at Tea of Spring! What we loved was, even though, they pretty much are the only game in town, they do not rip you off, the wine list is very reasonable and a good selection. We would go back and enjoy the nice ambiance, beauty of the Resort and relaxation.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
I love this place. The amenities are well maintained. I love that it has lots of pool to choose from. The room is spacious and i love the bathroom. Everything else is perfect but the downside is its pricey. Even the dinner buffet is pricey but I guess I expect that from a 5 star hotel. =D the beach is not that great because it has rocky parts in the ocean. We enjoyed our stay here and will definitely go back.,Comfort & Facilities:Location:Value for money
"Stayed five nights with my family of four, comfortably accomodated in a deluxe family suite; Buffets were very good: breakfast at Tides, Filipino cultural buffet, seafood buffet. The Chinese Tea Spring restaurant was also very good. Disappointed in the Tides dinner ala carte menu.

The grounds are beautiful and well maintained. Spent all of our time at the beach area, where staff attentive to our needs. Have been to other beaches on Cebu and the one at Shangri la is the best by far. Two pools also on the grounds, looked nice, not too crowded, but my family preferred the clear ocean waters by the beach. IT was like stepping into an aquarium. Many varieties of sea life and corals to be seen when snorkeling; water was very calm. Impressed that resort had plenty of lifejackets for guests to use.

Had a treatment done at Chi Spa: area was very serene, private; treatment was very good and reasonably priced. Wished they had more time to give me: they could only fit me in for a 1 hour treatment on our last day. My mistake-- next time I come, will schedule at Chi right away.

Down side is it's a 45 minute shuttle ride off the island where the resort is to the city proper where there are two malls you can visit. Skip the SM mall and go to Ayala mall. Disappointing that the shuttle wasn't free ( just a small fee, but I feel it should be free)

Would recommend staying here. Can't wait to come back",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
We were expecting to be wowed but hotel wasn't anything out of the ordinary. You can tell that the hotel is old. We were expecting the beach to be better than the other hotel we stayed in since this one is so pricey. They even charge for transfer to the mall which was a free service somewhere else. Breakfast buffet was just a little better but I don't think it was worth the price they're charging. We won't be coming back.,Value for money:Food
"Stayed at this hotel just over a week ago and I had a wonderful time. This was not my first stay in this hotel and as expected, Shangrila delivers excellent customer service and makes us feel so at home and had a wonderful time. The facilities are great, food and beverage service are excellent. My husband and I loved spending our time at the Buko bar and just enjoy the feel of the sea breeze. The cultural show on Saturday was great and the buffet dinner does give the guests a taste of the exotic dishes from the different regions of the country. We had invited our family for dinner at the Tea of Spring and we rated the meal excellent. We also had drinks at the lobby bar where there was a live band entertaining the guests. The kids (and the grown ups) in our party had a nice time, singing along to all the songs they were playing. Overall, the staff at Shangri La are all well trained in customer service, very friendly and happy to serve and always have a smile when greeting guests. They are such valuable asset to this hotel as they are the ones who makes this place a great place to be. We wish we stayed longer but sadly had to take our flight back home. We will surely come back.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"stayed at the Shangri-La with my husband whilst on a business trip in Cebu
we do not normally stay in resorts, so was quite surprised with the great service and facilities totally loved the beach bar and restaurant, food and cocktails amazing value and the service top class (crab cakes to die for!)
resort beach and gardens kept immaculate by the staff and loungers supplied with lovely towels
only downside was some noise around the pool at early evening and badly designed bathtub shower that involved water on the floor no matter how careful you were with the shower curtain
we paid extra for the newly upgraded rooms with ocean view - standard was excellent
highly commend the friendly service from all the staff",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"my husband and i had a great experience at shangri la in mactan. we had a ocean view room it was a wonderful ""wake up"" the next moring. the breakfast buffet has almost everything (since i am a breakfast lover) we enjoyed it much! .... staff is very friendly! we had our dinner at tides it was very crowded, though we had fun! we will definitively return to shangri la!",Food:Location
