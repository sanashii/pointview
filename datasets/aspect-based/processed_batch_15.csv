"Rundown hotel rooms, poor housekeeping staff service ,This hotel needs a major upkeep and maintenance works. For the room rate that I paid - Php12,800/night- the bathroom pipes were clogged, the housekeeping staff took forever to deliver our requests, the carpet is filthy, and no safety handles for PwDs inside the bathroom, except for one on the shower wall. Bath tub is too high for a pwd who has dofficulty climbing. Plus, the twin beds are soooo small. Marriott has better beds and rooms.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"Hotel needs major renovation and accounting system untrustworthy. ,Room furniture (on the horizon club category) needed a major renovation. The sink and bath tub drain were clogged, bathtub needs more safety measures for senior citizens like my mom. Housekeeping is super slow, our request for additional towel never came. Horizon club is ok but little children tended to make a lot of noise and hotel staff seemed helpless in keeping the children behave well. Worst of all, I was double charged for my horizon club room! The POS kept printing out one night and wouldn‚Äôt clear out. I had to pay for the room and then later that day I reviewed my receipts and emails and true enough, I was charged twice! I immediately called the front desk at horizon club and thanks to Therese, she quickly solved the problem and reimbursed me in cash. But really, Shang, your accounting system sucks. I wonder how many customers you‚Äôve already double charged because of your bad system? I had expected something more than a return on my excess payment - but none came. :-(",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Never fail our expectations,I am impressed with the security/medical response team. Firstly, when my skirt got caught on the escalator (though i was the 1 who pushed the stop button). They were kind enough to call our room and check on me, even though it was quite obvious that there was no bodily harm done. Second, there was an accident in the pool area involving one of the minor guest and the emergency team was quick to respond. The staff were all nice (front desk, gym, pool, lounge/bar, the heat, the staff in charge of our room/floor and even the security staff ). When I'm in the mandaluyong area, will choose edsa shangrila, will book through agoda or direct on the hotel's website. Never fails!!!!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

There are a lot of storage (drawrs & cabinet) which is essential if you're staying for longer. Refrigerator is not able to cool our drinks as much.

"Overall Good Hotel,This is a grand hotel with top dining facilities, friendly staff and an opulent lobby. It's in a great location and overall I had a comfortable stay.

"So so stay,Overall a fairly good Shangrila experience but could be better. We checked in on 24th Dec. The hotel came prepared for long queues at checkin by deploying more people and additional counters in the lower lobby so it was fast. The hotel was jam packed. There were 2 large venues for breakfast but the lines were still very long on both so we opted to have breakfast at the Lobby lounge. The food was too expensive, poorly prepared, and didn‚Äôt taste good at all especially the waffles and coffee. The waitress also got our orders wrong several times and seemed like she was new on the job. Not even apologetic. Checkout was also quick but getting the bellman to bring our luggages down to the lobby took an hour! The biggest nightmare though was getting the valet service to bring our car to the hotel entrance. Understandably the hotel was full and everyone was checking out at the same time, but it took about an hour‚Äôs wait before we got our car. üò©",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Almost Excellent (Except for the Breakfast Buffet),I (We) been long time clients of this hotel since the early 2000, everything about ESLM have always been perfect, but the Breakfast Buffet last Saturday was really disappointing. We usually have this at HEAT but this time we were asked to go to this make shift/temporary tent, we totally understand that it's a busy season and the hotel was packed, but the quality of food was just ""Not ESML Level"" this time. Didn't even bother to finish my first place because the food was bland and even the usual classic bacon was dry. Like what happened? Anyway, the rest of our stay was perfect, from the lobby lounge and the customer service was always, second to none. Will I come back? Of course ESML is always one of my favorite hotels for doing staycation. I hope that Breakfast Buffet experience will be the last though.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

"Beware of lying staff,The hotel is adjacent to the Shangri-La Mall and near Megamall, but the area around it is busy, crowded, and smoggy. Even the window view is dismal. As for the hotel itself, it still looks okay but the signs of aging are very obvious. The walls are thin enough for me to hear the noises from rooms on either side of mine. However, I was most disappointed in their staff for their dishonesty and inefficiency. First, I queued for more than 30 minutes before checking in. I was in line at 215pm and didn't get to the front desk until 245pm. The hotel was undermanned on a busy holiday. That in itself was already disappointing, but things got worse. When it was my turn to check in, the front desk staff handed me the key card to my room at the Garden Wing. I had to interrupt while she was describing the amenities. A Garden Wing room? But I booked a Tower Wing room which is more expensive by a couple of thousand pesos, I said. She said that since I requested a quiet room, the Garden Wing room would be a better option. I couldn't believe she was giving me a room that's cheaper than what I paid for! So I stood my ground. She finally admitted a Tower Wing room wasn't ready yet. Note that I had prepaid my room in full via credit card so I don't understand why they didn't prepare a room for me. Also, based on my previous experiences with other hotels, they upgrade your room and not downgrade it if the one you booked was not available. If they couldn't upgrade you, they give you a voucher for a discount or freebie. Plus you get an upfront explanation, not a deceitful tactic. The staff didn't try to explain to me why my room type was changed until I asked, and when I did ask, she made it seem like being given a lower-priced room was a favor she was doing for me. But I wanted the room I paid for. She said a Tower Wing room would be ready in an hour (4pm) and that I could extend my stay by an extra couple of hours to make up for the hassle.

"BAD Experience!,This may be my worst stay at any 5 star hotel ever! Checking in took more than an hour. Apparently, they have overbooked and the room I booked wasn't available. While other 5 star hotels would automatically offer a room upgrade since they were at fault, no, EDSA Shangri-La asked if I can pay extra for a bigger room that was already available. Needless to say, I wasn't willing to pay for the available room, so I waited forever till I can check-in. No drinks, no nothing to compensate or to help me with the waiting. THE FREAKIN VALLET SERVICE BUMPED MY CAR! When I got home from the hotel, I found a big scratch on my car and the paint job tore up. I immediately called the hotel up and told them one of their drivers damagted their cars, after a half a day of waiting for their response, they call me to said if they can just apply a rubbing compund on my car to hide the scratch. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!!! Then when I said no, attempted to make me feel guilty by saying that their driver would have to pay for the damages and will be deducted to his salary.

It's amazing, even for me, that things can be SO different just a block away. Located in Ortigas, it's a nice little area for high-end shopping (if you don't want to battle your way down EDSA to Makati) and cut off enough from the rest of the area to be quiet.

The breakfast before buffet at Heat Resto starts your day perfectly with a wide variety of selection from the buffet, which means you can opt to have different breakfast experience per day to your liking. The pool area is quaint and pretty, however if the pool were heated it would have been perfect to take a dip even on a very cold weather like the day we were there. Was also looking for a steam or sauna area to complement the swim but was told it was still under renovation. Otherwise, this is a perfect place to stay in especially because of its proximity to the nicest malls (it is connected via a bridgeway to my fave mall Shangrila and a few steps away to SM Megamall), that's why i thought if i were a foreigner visiting the country, i see this as a perfect choice of hotel to book. üòä",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

But, if you've got the cash it's not a bad place...what you would expect of a top class hotel in the center of Manila. It's also next door to two big malls...so there's lots of other places to drop some cash. The pool is very nice and I saw a lot of families with children having a great time.",Food:Value for money

"The Service Can be Better,I stayed at EDSA Shangri-La for a conference. The location is very good, considering that Manila has bad traffic jams nowadays, it will be difficult for us to go around to buy things. EDSA Shangri-La is located not very far from the airport, and there is a big SM Mega Mall shopping center just next to it, so you can buy, eat and do window shopping. It's also connected to Shangri-La Plaza, a higher up shopping center. The food in Shangri-La is very good and delicious. I really enjoyed my breakfast, lunch and snack times during conference. However, there were some disappointing points I had during my stay and all were regarding services to the customer. First, no chairs to sit at the lobby. It is a 5 star hotel, so you expect a nice lobby with some sofa and nice chairs to sit while you wait for your guest or taxi. The big sofas at the lobby were not for free. You have to order something from the cafe if you sit at the sofa. When I asked if there were any chair I can sit while waiting for my taxi, the bellboy pointed to a small alley hidden behind the stairs and main lobby and have only 1 set of sofa and 2 single chairs. Not what I pictured in mind of a nice lobby from a very well known 5 star hotel. Second, I stayed for 2 nights with my friend. The first night was under my friend's name and the second night was under my name. We asked for a same room for 2 consecutive nights so we didn't need to move out our things and check in again. On the 2nd day of our stay, nobody clean our room until 5.30 PM. We need to call the cleaning service to send someone. They just easily said that they will send someone to clean the room without even apologizing or gave us reason why they didn't make up our room yet. By the time they arrived to make up the room, we were getting ready to have dinner, we need to take a bath etc. So I just asked for the cleaning guy to just take out the bins and make up the bed briefly. I hope EDSA Shangri-La can improve their service to the cu",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"Great Family Hotel but Bad Breakfast Buffet,EDSA Shangri-La has been my preferred hotel ever since: I had my wedding first night here with my wife and also spent several special occasions here now that we have kids. The staff service is excellent and are very well-suited when bringing young kids. The pool is great for kids as well and the location is very convenient most especially with the Shangrila Mall and SM Megamall right beside the hotel. Chi Spa is also one of the best spa's in the metro. My only complaint, which has been my complaint ever since, is the quality of the lobby restaurant where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets. While they hotel is most definitely five-star, the restaurant is most decidedly three-star. And here's why: - The furnishings are worse for wear and are in dire need of replacement or facelift - Availability of food is bad. The bread in the bread section of the breakfast buffet usually does not get refilled when it runs out so try and get your bread asap. Pretty ironic since bread would be the staple for breakfast. - If you're the second group to use a table, do expect that the table setting will not be as complete as the first. Napkins would usually be missing as well as the condiments. - Manpower is surely lacking and while the staff are very courteous and accommodating, service tends to be slow as they are undermanned and overworked. - This also applies to the slowness of buffet food getting refilled most especially during peak hours.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Great Room,upgrade to the ""spa"" room, kids enjoyed the pool, malls and other entertainment were accessible,As usual, Edsa Shangri-La did not disappoint us. We were upgraded by the staff (I don't know if this was because they had a lot of people checking in due to the New Year's Eve party or if it's my Golden Circle membership). As such, we were able to stay at the spa rooms with our complementary fruits and drinks. The kids enjoyed the pool area. The staff were always so nice and accommodating to our kids. The room was so relaxing. It was a 5-star stay.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

Good dessert and service. next to shopping centre and 15 minutes to green Hills for all the imitation bags, shoesm attire and pearls. The Japanese and Chinese restaurants in the hotel were good and the menu were very comprehensive. The steam sauna worked like a charm - one gets sweaty very quickly.",Food:Location:Staff
"Adequate but overpriced.,Location,It seems like you are paying mainly for a huge lobby and a nice garden. The rooms are average. I was disappointed with the restaurants which all seem to close at 10 pm which is not good for an area that has business that primarily operate during the evening. It makes planning business dinners impossible. We went to a buffet that said it closes at 10:30 pm but they promised to keep the buffet open until Midnight. So we sat down at 10:10 pm, had one serving and then they closed the buffet and took the food away at 10:30 pm. I felt I was not told the truth and spent $100 for half a meal and walked out hungry. Also the business office opens late and closes early. Again the Philippines have a lot of businesses that operate at night (call centers) that foreign business people work with and Shangri-La does not appreciate the hours they need to have dinner and access to a business office.",Food:Location:Value for money
"Perfect getaway weekend for the family!,Food, rooms, attentive staff,This summer we decided to go hotel hopping in Metro Manila, Palawan And Boracay...since 3 out of 4 of my boys were working and one had a family, the perfect place to bond was at the EDSA Shangri la. They loved the variety and quality of food, the rooms and the attention of the staff...no request no matter how insignificant was left unattended...my only problem was that the pool seemed to small for the number of families that checked in for the weekend...we were mostly local residents who didn't want the hassle of having to fly or drive through long hours....the pool was packed!

"Despite its size, service felt personal,Room size, TV size, bath tub, service, service, service,Husband and I planned a one night staycation and EDSA Shang is conveniently located in Ortigas right beside two shopping centers. Pros: 1.) The best breakfast ever. We ordered the American Breakfast set for 1. We didn't get to finish it. It really is good for 2.5 people, if you ask me. The brewed coffee was exquisite. At P1,000++, very worth it 2.) Service was excellent. Everyone was aware. I didn't want to bother anyone by asking where X place was but someone would approach me quietly and ask if I needed help. Cons: (more like minor inconveniences, really 1.) Weak WiFi signal in other parts of the room except or the desk. Considering the market penetration of portable devices such as tablets and smartphones, I feel that the free WiFi they give to guests should be strong everywhere including the bathroom. Yes, including the bathroom 2.) The air conditioning was way too cold. I wanted an escape from the summer-like December weather we've been having but we were freezing despite the comforter and the fleece blanket we had over ourselves. We tried adjusting the thermostat but it felt like the air conditioner was defying us. 3.) Though we were upgraded to the garden wing as a courtesy (which is great), we ended up in a room with barely a view. Well, we had a view of the condominium across the street. Something to consider when checking in. We would've loved to have a garden view or a city view.",Comfort & Facilities:Internet:Staff

As I went to walk down the ramp the security guard offered me one the hotels cars to go to the airport. I explained that we wanted a taxi as it would be cheaper. He asked if we wanted a metered taxi, to why I replied ""Yes"". He said ""Wait here and I will get one for you."" He yelled to the taxi which we could see in the street, from the hotel entrance doors. The taxi came up and we got in. I asked the taxi driver if the meter was on to which he replied "" No, this is a hotel taxi."" I did not understand this entirely but assumed that it was a hotel courtesy taxi, meaning there would be no charge. When we got to the airport I offered the taxi driver P100 tip. He responded that the taxi cost was actually P600! So, instead of being allowed to walk the 30 meters to the street and getting charged P150 -200 we were charged ~three times the amount.

"Good location but average in all other aspects,location,I stayed at the Shangri-la over the recent Lunar New Year period and I must say that it was not impressive like most of the Shangri-la hotels in Asia While the location was convenient, close to malls and major places like Makati and Greenhills, the hotel was really crowded with conventions and locals celebrating Chinese New Year which made the hotel less exclusive and classy like what the brand stands for. I stayed in the tower block and the rooms were jaded looking and in need of a refurbishment. Even the TV as an old box version and even average hotels today offer flat screen TVs. All in all, a rather average hotel like many in Manila.",Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Huge complex with all facilities,Breakfast! The breakfast was beyond anything i have seen anywere. Like 8 different fresh juices.. so many cakes, hot meals.. unbelievable. Get up early and eat at this hotel, or you loose out!!,The rooms are kind of small and ordinary. I thought a ""Deluxe"" room would give me some space to stay in and some deluxe feeling, but nah.. i could have stayed at best western if the room is what is important, and it is for this price. Whats the point in big fancy hallways if the room isnt the same? The service at the hotel is perfect, almost too much cause they even call to confirm everything. But i rather confirm positive on the phone then to wait for poor service other places:) All in all.. I might come back, but not sure. Probably better for buisness-people.
