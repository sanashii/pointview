"Descent Hotel with Marvelous Service!!!,I have been to many 5 star hotels around asia but never been to a hotel with staff showing this high level of dedication and appreciation to their customer. e.g. The looby staff was amazingly helpful! When there was lounger available at the beach or pool there was always staff available and finding a solution! We stayed for 8 nights over christmas. Higher rating overall was not possible since the rooms have seen their best years (but still OK) and the hotel was over occupied which leaded to waiting time at the breakfast.

"Overpriced for a hotel in the Philippines,The facility is well kept, but that's it. Makes for good photo sessions. The place is overpriced for a hotel in the Philippines or in Southeast Asia. We've stayed in better hotels in Cebu and in other islands in the Philippines for much less and a better experience. We've also stayed in much better places in FIJI, Bali, Thailand for less. The food is very overpriced. Buy one get free happy hour is a joke. Cocktails are 400 pesos each. Elsewhere the max I've seen is 180. There is the option of going to Ayala for cheaper dining and shopping, but what's the point of doing that and spending money on a resort you aren't present in. I basically paid for an overpriced Facebook update.",Value for money:Food

Great pools and the snorkling just off the beach is superb. Very good breakfast in the Acqua Restaurant.,The biggest disappointment and the reason for us to not come back is the enormous amount of children everywhere! There is not one spot in the resort where adults that do not want to be around children can sit and enjoy their holiday. There is two big pools filled to the brim with yelling and screaming children. The beach: same. The resort is huge, why can't their be a spot for adults only? The main restaurant Tides is off limits during buffet time.

So if you intend to stay longer, might be a good idea to buy some stuff before coming in. We didn't go out except to the Spanish restaurant just outside.

Noe in the front security was very courteous who made our easy access to the transportation... The Cowrie fine dining was awesome overlooking by the ocean, the buko bar, the breeze bar, the main lobby at night is perfect for some drinks while listening to the music..The only thing I was shocked was the taxes they have the VAT, BEVERAGE TAX, FOOD TAX and understandle 10% Gratuity is already added so don't be surprised for a lot of charges added to your orders/bills.

Par contre, le jour de notre départ, nous avons fait notre checkout à 3h du matin sans aucune indémnisation! Au final, nous n'avons pas payé d'extra mais je trouve tout de même que la demande était indécente. Les alentours de l'hôtel : aucune activité en dehors de l'hôtel. Il faut prévoir d'aller à Cebu le soir sinon il n'y a pas grand chose à faire. La plage privée de l'hôtel : trop sale, beaucoup trop. Il y a des bouteilles en plastique partout, des détritus partout sur le sable et dans l'eau. L'eau est saturée d'algues mortes. Le restaurant de plage est rempli de petits moustiques que les employés de l'hôtel tentent tant bien que mal de chasser. On s'attendait à beaucoup mieux pour une plage privée dans un hôtel 5* aux Philippines. Le coût des activités et de la restauration : tout coûte cher dans cet hôtel. Etant donné qu'il y a très peu de commerces ou d'activités aux alentours, les prix pratiqués dans l'hôtel son exorbitants. Cela fait 10 ans que je voyage dans des 5 étoiles en Asie mais le Shangri-La de Cebu a certainement la palme du rapport qualité/prix le moins attractif!",

No sandwich or something similar. Maybe we were spoiled by the club at the Sofitel Plaza in Manila, which were wirliche 5 Stars. This one deserves more than 4 stars.

The selection at cocktail time is very small, 3 to 4 snacks, but mostly fried. The best is still the sushi, but here are only 4 pieces rausgestellt (for up to 50 guests in the club).

"Resort-Hotel mit Schwächen,Die grosse Eingangshalle wirkt einladend und edel. Das Hotel bietet ein All-In-One Angebot, mit mehreren Restaurants, Strandbars und einem SPA. Die Zimmer sind gefällig eingerichtet und haben bequeme Betten.,Das Hotel erinnert eher an ein Robinson Familien-Resort als an ein Luxushotel im engen Sinne. Für Paare eher ungeeignet, da das Hotel riesig ist, dieses deshalb überlaufen wirkt und man nur schwer abschalten kann. Neben den für die Philippinen relativ hohen Zimmerpreise, sind die Preise für Verpflegung aber auch Massagen, masslos überrissen. D.h. auf einem Niveau, das für Singapur oder Hongkong üblich ist, wenn überhaupt.",Food

"Had to cut short the holiday...,The beach, the kids pool area, the breakfast.,The first room they gave us was a bit ratty and overlooking the garden and above the air-conditioning plant making a full on noise 24/7. I had to get it changed but noticed many rooms were in this position. Luckily they found a much nicer and bigger renovated room, with seas views, which was supposedly the same standard... The resort itself was really nice with big grounds and lots of indoor and outdoor play areas for kids. Not to mention a beautiful private beach. The breakfast was fantastic, although it's the second time I have stayed in this resort and on both occasions the fresh mangoes were sour, which is not what you expect when you visit Cebu.. The buffet dinner was probably good if your Asian, but if you're a westerner you may not find much joy, at least I didn't. After that it was a steak sandwich off the menu. My 2 year old son was not eating properly, since his mom was not preparing his meals. The staff at breakfast were truly fantastic and helpful, and really the best part of the trip. They cooked special food for him as per moms directions and it did help a lot, although it could not see us through the whole day, so it got to be a problem. This was followed by a cough developing and the need to keep him away from the water slide, which would prove difficult, so we ended up having to leave 3 days early. Sadly, no refund but I guess that's the way it is.....",Food:Staff:Location

"Just WOW!,Restaurant choices, activities, service,Just wow is all we can say. We stayed for 4 days with my in-laws. Talk about spoiled for choice for food .. if you wanted, you don't need to leave the resort. Seafood, grill, you name it. Attended the Filipino Cultural show and BBQ. Amazing (happens a few times per week). My days usually consisted of a short morning swim in the ocean (you're basically on the beach), buffet breakfast (never could have enough omelets), laze around the pool or beach until lunch, big lunch at one of the restaurants, a nap followed by dinner, then drinks at the bar listening to live music. If you need to get away, there are hourly shuttles to the major shopping areas of Cebu. We had seniors with us so this made sense, otherwise we would have just taken a taxi. I think the best way to sell this place is the following, it's big enough that you and your partner/travel companion(s)/group can never run out of things to do together .. which is big enough to keep everyone busy that you don't need to see them all day. Can't recommend this place enough.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

All the service attendants were helpful, articulate, and intelligent.

Little things count a lot, and this place abounds with it: fruits for free, iced towels creatively packaged and offered to over-heated guests, flowing ""showers"" that just out of crevices on the beach.....lovely!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

"Noisy and overcrowded hotel,We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the mainwing and booked via Agoda for its 5-star rated and its brand name. Unfortunately we just couldn't sleep well each night because of the noise from the hallway. The room door was not sound-proof; we could hear all noises coming from every room door opening/closing, people talking while walking along the hallway randomly that woke us up throughout the night, and also in the morning. We complained to the hotel, and were given an ""upgrade"" room, so to speak at the oceanwing, and it was slightly improved. When checking out the lady at the front-desk asked if we were happy with our stay, and we told her about the noise and she was politely suggesting in our next trip we should book a suite or high-graded room. I believe she missed the point which is a 5-star hotel should at least be able to provide the basic need to customers, i.e. quiet room for guests to sleep well. Upgraded room is only the extension of degree of luxuary and comfort. For the breakfast area was a nightmare for people like us as couples wanted to relax in this so called"" resort&spa"". There were hundreds of room guests filled up the resturant and many were to queue up for table. On Sunday morning, hotel even had to open the adjcent Chinese resturant to accomodate some guests to sit after picking up the food from the main cafe. I surely believe this hotel has been operated for so many years in business and still don't know when is the peak season and how to divert guests into different areas for breakfast and dinning? Can they extend the breakfast time to 11:00 instead of 10:30, so density of guests would not be so focused in the last hour? I am sure we are not the only one complaining this noisy and overcrowded issues. Hotel management should be addressing these matters on their top piroity...If this is ""resort $ spa"" hotel, then it was my mistake. Definitely we'll not return to this so called "" resort&spa"" hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

As it is, the resort is a destination by itself. Their pools are so inviting and their beach, stunning. Our room's large but we had to request bedroom slippers as we did not find any. One sad thing though, they failed to greet my fiancee on her birthday last June 1.

"Great Marine Park,Nice marine park,Shangrila has excellent frontline staffs but their supervisor and managers needs to be more pro-active on guest delightment. I have made several complaints and their standard reply is i take note of this. Standard replies and nothing else. Such a waste!",Staff
"Front Office Service Needs Improvement,Established Hotel which thinks of all client needs,The front office supervisor needs to be more guest oriented. She is a Korean and her staffs were busy and i asked her about changing my hotel transfer because i did not want to wait for the scheduled time and take a taxi. Instead of solving it for me (She was free) she told me to wait for her colleague who was busy attending to some other guests and i had to wait a good 10 minutes before another colleague was instructed by her to solve for me. Why is like that? If I am a supervisor, i would take initiative to get it resolved and not make the guest wait, everything is computerised and I am sure she can solve it. Or is it because she is the supervisor and it is not her work to do so? I wasted a precious 20 minutes before i could get a taxi because not sure when i could be attended to. The supervisor and managers needs to improve and be more service oriented like their front line staffs whom are always service oriented!",Staff
"Poor Value,Facilities and Staffs,The facilities and staffs were excellent but let down by strict control on hotel profits. Be prepared to pay for every little incidentals which should be complimentary. That is how profit focus Shangrila is and they do not bother too much about guest complaining besides saying 'I understand how you feel' Be prepared to pay for the things you expect to be free!",Value for money:Staff

"Inadequate restaurants and overpriced hotel,far from the city, fully booked restaurants & no free airport shuttle,It was a bad stay! Their resturants are too small to accomodate their guests. We arrived at 4pm and tried to make dinner reservations and they told us that they're sorry because all of their restaurants are fully booked at 7 and we had to wait till 9 pm to get accommodated. at breakfast same situation we were made to wait before getting accommodated (a lot of guests were asked to wait) and also they have limited choice of breakfast.their facilities are also very small compared to the pictures. Tip: stay at plantation bay or crimson instead for the same services and lower price!",Food

"Pretty awesome hotel,Got it at discount, beautiful beach, friendly staff,We got the hotel at a huge discount which is why I gave a score of 5 for ""Value for money"". They had some construction going on, but the noise didn't bother us at all, it was just that we couldn't see the entire lobby as to what it should look like. Great staff, no complaints at all. Very accommodating and courteous! Rooms were very clean, neat, very nice and comfortable! If only the TV could have HD =(",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money

"Get away to relax,service was great from arrival to departure time. service staffs were attentive. great service especially at the front desk n the assistant manager.,Overall was very good. Unfortunately when I wanted to use the toilet in my room after checking in, I was shocked to see a tiny poo floating on the toilet bowl. I flushed few times n cleaned the seat before using it. When I was soaking in the tub, to my amazement I noticed poo stains around the toilet bowl and the shower curtain was stained with algae. As it was late I rest the matter till the following day. I called guest service the next morning to request for my toilet bowl to be cleaned with full information on the condition of the toilet bowl. When I returned from my swim, the same stains were still there. After my shower I got hold of the chambermaid and I gave her the instructions to clean and change the shower curtain which wasn't the job of hotel guest. I wonder if the guests service counter understood of my complain and communicated well with housekeeping department. Poo in the toilet bowl and stains upon checking in is not a small matter, but they didn't seem to take it seriously so much so I had to give direct instructions to the chambermaid. I believe before any check out room is released for new guest, the housekeeper should check thoroughly which in my case was not carried out. I took pictures of the curtain and stained toilet bowl. This is not acceptable at all for any hotel n especially Shangrila. I didn't make a big fuss as I didn't want the chambermaid to take the blame n ask to leave. I am writing so as to let Shangrila Mactan housekeeping department to improve. If you need the pictures as proof, I can provide them. I hope Shangrila Mactan gets a copy of what I am writing.",Staff:Cleanliness

"Unacceptable breakfast situation,Extensive grounds/activities available, friendly staff that tried their best (but you can tell they were stressed by the crowd) and reasonably comfortable sleep.,All was good except for the exceptional crowd the day we stayed and the need to queue/wait for breakfast. This the first time I have to queue to eat breakfast at a 5-star location. To me, this is unacceptable especially given the rate I paid. The facilities to cater for breakfast for a hotel that size was inadequate. I feel sorry for the staff that really tried their best to manage the crowd. I would like to commend the hotel on attempting to give me a room earlier, this was really appreciated. This made me feel that it is indeed a 5-star hotel abeit marred by the breakfast experience.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
