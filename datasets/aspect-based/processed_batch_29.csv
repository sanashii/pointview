"Gold but old,What makes this hotel great is the staff. They have the best people in the hotel industry. What’s not working for them really is the old carpet, furnitures, bathroom fixtures, etc. Pls be very careful when booking their rooms. Check the fine print for further taxes and charges. The base rate of rooms are cheap, but after the taxes and other charges included, it doesn’t come out as cheap anymore. And sometimes that doesn’t even come wih breakfast. So the final cost is just as expensive as the other hotels in the area, but they’re staff is still the best.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"Excellent all around,Makati shangri-la exceeded my expectations from a hotel. The optional included breakfast and lounge I feel were worth the extra money. The breakfast buffet was delicious and worth the extra fee on top of our fairly decently priced room considering the type of hotel. All staff members were extremely helpful and friendly. They were courteous and would pause whatever they were doing in hallways to greet you with a friendly smile and hello. I felt very well taken care of and did not once feel in lack of services. Wifi at the hotel was readily available. The in house gym was more than ample with a large floor space, machines, dumbells, squat racks, more or less all you’d need to get a decent workout in. There’s also a nice pool and tennis court on the same floor. Though you are paying a premium price, it’s still significantly cheaper than I would have for such a hotel in another country. Its a steal at the price we paid. I’d love to return again, and in fact plan to.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food

I paid so much more than what I remember I did pay at EDSA Shangri-la for a tennis court that's sub-standard.

It is conveniently located to all the best stores and restaurants, and traffic around the hotel is far less intrusive than other areas in the city. The hotel's security is awesome, especially if safety is a concern for you in Manila. My room was extremely comfortable with all the amenities I like: such as bathrobes, slippers and fancy toiletries. The bath and showers are the best. I wish all hotels would adopt such items. The restaurants are not inexpensive, but what can you expect--you are at the best place in town. Breakfast was delicious and checking out easy. I caught a nasal infection while there and had to see the on-call doctor. She was very obliging and gave me the proper prescriptions to conquer my illness.

Warm, friendly service and good security.,Hotel van that picked us up from airport was slightly run down, expected something better for PHP3000 transportation cost,Pricey, but well worth it for an overnight stay in Manila! We arranged for airport pick up and were immediately greeted by a uniformed Shang Rep right after exiting customs and escorted to the Shang Lounge within the airport. Cold bottles of mineral water were then served with a warm smile. Check-in was fairly easy and porter was already waiting with our luggage by our room door even before we got there.

The 2nd time I called the housekeeping dept, was the only time they really replaced the bedsheet/linen with a new one. Since it was also our anniversary, they told us that they will set up our room.

I am not a great fan of the Makati Shang as there is never any place to sit in the lobby while you wait for friends, a car pick-up or just want to rest for a moment. The lobby is a big zero for convenience.... its a bit over-priced for what your are getting and getting into the hotel by car is a nightmare due to the torturous security procedures.

Especially the bathroom is in desperate need of an overhaul., I would also recommend to replace the carpet in the room every 25 years or so... Dull pool area, no cozy or tropical atmosphere whatsoever. Just a rectangular lap pool, that's it.

Items, including several wet ones were placed in paper carriers. The bags of groceries were relatively heavy. Paper carriers are not suitable for wet items as well as having to walk back the distance to the hotel.

They ran up to him and kicked him out because he had on a robe. Said it was in their policy but when asked to produce policy they said they would give it to us at check out. Not a way to handle that situation it was unnecessary. They kept saying sorry but it was disingenuous because they were not listening to why he did that.

This hotel is located in a great location in walking distance to the Glorietta Malls and the Greenbelt Malls. I rated the cleanliness one notch down only because the hotel is in need of a renovation which I was told was going to commence in 2017. Once the renovation is completed, this hotel would be a 5-star rating in all facets. You will never see a grand hotel lobby like this particular Shangri-La in the newer hotel chains.

"Needs to go back to its prime,Location, amenities, support personnel,Overall, the look and feel of this hotel has not changed over the decades. However, in my most recent stay, there were significant details I observed which may indicate that it is already past its prime and needs to go back to its old glory days and meticulous standards. First, the staff and attendants are generally very friendly and personable. Everyone from the concierge to the housekeeper always express a warm attitude matching their smiles. However, when you meet the attendants on a late part of their shift their stress becomes evident. When I checked in in my most recent stay, the receptionist seemed to be like in the last hours of his shift since he looked tired and only wanted to finish my booking. I had concerns about my room arrangement and reservations, but he never offered any alternative solution nor suggested to confer with his superior. Although the matter was no big issue on my part, I left the front desk thinking that he could have at least taken a few more minutes to try to exhaust other ways to resolve my query. The same also goes for their lobby lounge when I observed there was only one waitress running between 10+ tables attending to nearly 40 persons, including myself. As for the in-room dining, the food served in my room was not of the same quality as what they have in their restaurants. I had small issues with being served dry, old chicken meat and manhandled pasta, but at least they were still edible, although not even three-star quality.",Staff:Food

I don't know if we were just unlucky or simply that the service was bad and there was nothing special about it. On our first night, my partner experienced severe pain from sleeping with a bad position and we requested for some pain patches and it took a good minutes before it arrive.

They look scary but are also very nice...but latest after leaving the hotel you should never forget!!! While you pay over 200€ per NIGHT in this hotel , the staff maybe earns just 180€ per MONTH! That is absurd! small tipp for airport transfer: A normal airport taxi I payed 1400PHP from the airport to the hotel. The way back I payed 1900PHP for a hoteltransfer with the smallest available car.

We suggest go out across the road, very nice cafe and more reasonable coffee price (poolside P200+) 5: RED fine dining restuarant, steak was tough - this should not happen in such a restuarant and especially at P2000+ for the steak - Outback is much better",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

CC and RA were both dismissive, disrespectful, condescending to my daughter bc she was a teen. Awful experience. Will never come back.",Staff
"disappointing 5-star hotel reception,So many bellboys in the lobby who just looked at us when we alighted from the car and did not even assist my son load our bags in the trolley. I lodged a verbal complaint with the shift manager but until now i have not heard from the management. It just shows that management is not concern about customer service.",Staff
"It needs better maintenance. For the price, it should be in better shape. The breakfast was not good,The onions in the onelot tasted like fish. The socket plate in the room was broken. Room was a 3 star room at best. The cost of the room at 160$/night was about twice what a compeible room in the US would be. Location near mall is a good thing.",Value for money:Food
