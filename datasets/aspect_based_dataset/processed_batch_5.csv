"My first time to be in Shangrila Mactan, while the sea view is the same as that of Movenpick or Crimson, the size of the hotel and amenities is by far awesome! Different pool sizes for every function and lots of space to move around. The rooms are very comfortable.

Great hotel to pick and relax when in Cebu Mactan.",Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri La is about 15 minutes from the airport and 45 minutes from the city center. I enjoy staying here. Service is good, the staff are friendly, there are 2 pools but they removed the jet pumps on the other one. The beach is not so wide but tolerable. The gym is fully equipped and open 24 hours. They have a lot of activities for adults and kids and have a huge play area for kids.

I usually eat at The Tides. Best breakfast buffet ever! And now, their selection has grown. They also have a Korean and Japanese buffet for breakfast. Expect this play to be full during the holiday season. It's a nice place to spend time with your family.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
Stayed two nights for a mini break. The most disapppointing part was the food service. Arrived for buffet breakfast on first morning at one of the two restaurants available only to find no food left. Amidst a lot of complaints by guests staff seemed very confused about what was happening and failed to get more food out to the stations. The first night we had a great meal at the seafood restaurant so went back for the second night and the food was so below average it was inedible. We asked to speak to the head chef who came over and offered absolutely no reply whatsoever - just stood there nodding then walked off. Unbelievable really for a 5 star hotel. Don't think we will be returning.,Food:Staff
"The view from the top floor was really amazing. Interior of the room is dated but all time classic and very clean. Resort staffs are also accommodating and helpful. Their bar by the sea was really nice, price was a bit pricey but still affordable. Breakfast buffet was real large, lots to choose from. Their massage was really 5 star experience!",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I've been staying at Shangri-La Mactan since I've been back to Cebu in 2006. This is, bar none, The BEST RESORT in CEBU. Every time I'm in Cebu, I always make it a point to stay at least 2 nights per month I'm here.

The minute you arrive the Resort, you can feel the air of local friendly attendants catering to whatever you need. The quality of staff, ambiance of the room and the resort, the restaurants, the spa, the pool, fitness club and the beach is second to none.

I've been invited to stay at other resorts by friends and family and I always end up being so disappointed with the experience. Why settle for something that pretends to be paradise when paradise is just close by.

If you're in Cebu, stay at my home away from home in Cebu. You will never be disappointed. Since nobody is perfect, if ever they make a mistake, they will make sure to fix the issue and make sure you walk away happy.

Shangri-La Mactan- please keep up the wonderful job!!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I've been to Shangri-La's resorts in various countries, and this was my first time here in Shangri-La's Mactan which I've spent 4 days here. I have to say 4 days were not enough here, and I've only stayed in the resort. The resort provided a large varieties of water sports, beautiful private beach, one quiet side pool and one big main pool, that would be perfectly fit if you wanna find a place to relax, while you can also enjoy a wonderful marine experience of Cebu, you can find a balance here. Having mentioned about relax, I strongly recommend you try the famous Chi Spa here, that won't disappointed you!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We just spent 2 brilliant nights at the Shangri La!
This resort is beautifully placed with a huge and beautifully designed landscape comprising a lavish pool area with several different kinds of pools.
They also have an outstanding wet play area for children. My two sons loved it so much and my wife and me enjoyed the ubiquitous team of lifeguards giving us the comfort of not needing to be ""glued"" to our two boys.
On top I would like to thank the duty manager Julie Limotan who - by supporting us greatly- made us always feel very, very welcome!
We'll definitely be back!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"My husband and I spent a few days at the Shangri La. We had gone between the Shangri La and plantation Bay, I'm so glad we picked the Shangri La. We booked and Ocean Wing room so we would be able to utilize the Lounge Level, which did not disappoint. Their breakfasts and appetizers at night were perfect as well as the service their staff provided. We went to the spa for a morning both receiving massages and spent time using the spa facilities. My husband is a scuba diver and dove with Scotty's dive shop while we were there, they did three wall dives which he enjoyed all three they were a little pricier then normal dives he has completed but well worth it. We spent time by the pool on the ocean wing, the staff was great there as well. We witnessed the staff cleaning the umbrellas by the pool and ocean every morning which I have not witnessed at other resorts we have stayed at. We have a friend whose wife is from the Philippines and has not been home for 5 years we asked a staff member what they would want from the Philippines if it were them. She responded with a few items and when we went to check out there was a typed out list of items waiting for us. We have no complaints about this resort.",Staff

"We booked a panorama view room at the ocean wing with the Oslob adventure package. The staffs forgot our welcome drinks at arrival, but we didn't mind. The panorama view was amazing! Over looking the horizon and the hotel private beach. Highly recommend it!

However the hotel facility is very old and outdated, we had problem with our lights in the room. The light would suddenly switch on at night while we were sleeping, some other night we had to get ready in the dark with our flash light, cuz it would not switch on.

For the Oslob trip, you will need to wake up around 4 am, to be ready at the lobby before 5am. We received a phone call from our guide in the dark( the lights didn't work), telling us she was already waiting for us at the lobby. We rush to the lobby but there was no one waiting for us. We asked the hotel concierge for assistance. She was with an other guest at the time so she was very annoyed by us. She only told us there is no guide rudely, and ignored us. My husband and I waited for a while, as the time went by, we decided it is safer to walk all the way to the main lobby for assistance. It took the main concierge a while to find out what happened. No one seems to know what happened!

30 mins went past, we were finally been told that the tour guide had taken the wrong guests, we had to wait for their return, in order to go on our trip. It was not how we wanted to start our day at 5am in the morning. The hotel did not do anything for their cost of the inconveniences.

Despite the issues we had, it is still worth to visit. Swimming with the whale sharks in Oslob was an amazing experience. The hotel beach was very nice and clean, the water was so clear. You can discover all kind of fish and corals.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
I was at this hotel to attend the most happening conference Asian Carriers Conference (ACC) 2016. Although I did not go to any of the rooms but I could tell for sure about the greatness of it just by roaming around the hotel and its other facilities provided for the delegates. The beach view can take away anybody's pain from their heart and soul. I had a personal time to visit its beach view by the pools. It is so quiet and amazing. At night we had a beach party as well. It was an incredible experience to witness such beauty.,Comfort & Facilities
"We battled 3 storms from Tokyo, the flight was delayed, we got in about 5 am yet we had to wait in line to confirm our room. I was getting irritated but managed to keep a sour smile....the receptionist surprised me about a room more than what I paid for! I expected a huge family room worth 36,000php, instead I got a Shang wing corner suite with two bedrooms, two bathrooms and all L'occitane amenities! my son was happy, he was rolling and turning on his King size bed. The staff were helpful, breakfast in front of the big swimming pool facing the ocean was perfect. The fresh veggy and fruit smoothies with a full house menu prepared us for a healthy day. We spent the whole day at the beach, snorkeling, kayaking and jet skiing. The hotel only charged me for the use of jet ski, we will always stay here when we come back to Cebu.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangrila has been in Mactan since the 1990s but it still remains as one of the premier resort hotels in Cebu. If you want peace and quiet as well as family bonding, this is a great place to stay. Though the facility is a bit old, the hotel right now is undergoing renovation works. But it does not deprive the guests of the comfort and quiet and privacy they need. Love the pool. I love their beach. Would like to visit the place again in the future.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"The service is a true dedication to excellence and Filipino hospitality. Best for family getaway, most certainly to the worrisome parents - a very kid friendly place in every corner.

Great pastries, and with various international cuisines. Definitely coming back.",Food:Staff:Location
"This is by far the best resort hotel I have ever stayed at. Impeccable service, fantastic facilities, great food and great activities. The only down side is that you will spend your entire stay in the hotel and miss out on some of the other local offerings. Great pools, great gym and a selection of accommodation to suit all budgets so long as your budget starts at php8000. For the ultimate try the garden wing overlooking the pool.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
Worth the visit! The place is a great vacation getaway! I'm sure you and your family (all ages) will enjoy stay in Shangrila Mactan. The staff are very courteous. The whole resort is clean.

"We enjoyed our stay at the Shangri-la Mactan. The kids did not run out of things to do: Adventure Zone, pool, mini golf, ping-pong, arcade, beach. We also did the snorkeling safari. 4 stars because they checked us in late. But overall a great experience.",Location
"Before going back to work we decided to stay in Shangrila Mactan Cebu for a short vacation. It was totally worth it, the kids enjoyed the swimming in the pools. The beach was also great, we were literally swimming along with a group of colorful fishes.",
"Very family oriented resort so couples and singles be warned. Lots of Koreans too if that's an issue but would say 99% of guests were of Asian descent. The staff were outstanding. How can they be so darn polite and courteous all the time?! Look into some of the packages they have online. We were on the family fun package with one child but really well worth it if you have 2. Great pool areas though they should really enforce the 2hr belongings left unattended gets removed rule. Most of the good spots around beach and pools already had towels on them by 9am. Private beach was beautiful . White Sandy beach and clear blue water! Plenty of activities and shows to keep you entertained well. Overall, a fantastic vacation.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We were allocated an ocean wing room on the ground floor. However the room is very quiet and the room size is big with king size bed.

From the airport pickup to check in, the whole process was very efficient. The staff are very friendly. THE whole place really reminds me of carribean islands that we have been before. Truly relaxing and calming.

Our room do have free wifi and a basket of fruits.

The breakfast is buffet breakfast with plenty to choose from. It is marvellous.

The private beach on this hotel is lovely. The sand is fine and the beach is very clean. Water is crystal clear with plenty of fishes. You do not need to swim far to see the fishes.

We did book the gazebo for one evening for romantic dinner. The setting is great. Facing the sea. Service is fabulous. The food is OK.

Spa is wonderful. My therapist was very knowledgable and gd at what she does. Would definitely recommend going there to have me time.

Even when the hotel is fully booked on the day we check out, they even try to make every effort to accommodate our request of late check out. This is great service.

The only drawback I would say is: the tour offer from the hotel is extremely expensive. We also wish when check in they will give us the resort guide then and explain a bit what is included in our package.",Food:Staff

"The resort was definitely a good choice for our family reunion. There is something for everyone at the resort, especially for the little ones in our group. Check-in and check-out took a while but the staff were courteous and apologetic about rooms not being ready by the standard check-in time, or when our accounts took some time to be collated during check-out.

Staff - from the airport pick-up, front desk, housekeeping, restaurants, activity centres, and pool & beach crew – were all responsive with our questions, requests, and issues during our stay. Having an in-house clinic (just like other Shangrila hotels & resorts in the country) was also a plus.

Best to check or inquire of all resort activities at the beginning of your stay. For example, fish feeding only occurs on certain days of the week, and there may be special events happening which are open to resort guests at certain times/seasons. Beach was clean however wearing aqua socks are advisable.

The buffet breakfast spread at Tides has more variety compared to Acqua. However Acqua is great if you’re looking for a more airy and less-hectic/quiet atmosphere during breakfast.",Staff:Food
"We did a 4d3n tour of Cebu. I planned our last night to be in Shangrila Mactan, and it was perfect.
It co-incided with our anniversary and the Shangrila Mactan made it sooo special.

The place is amazing. Huge landscaped areas with 2 fantastic pools. An amazing beach front, with white grainy sand, lots of fish and coral.
4 restaurants (we were able to eat at Cowrie Cove and Tides).
The room is big, clean and comfy. The beddings soft and fluffy. The TV with great choices of channels.

We were greeted with welcome drinks and a flower arrangement by a lady in fully traditional Filipino dress and it was impressive and set the mood for the whole stay.

Everything worked out great.
From Marie Flor and the fast easy reservation over the phone. It took 5 mins to get my reservation on the phone and it was so efficient and personal. I mentioned it was our anniversary trip and to my surprise, after an hour upon arrival our door bell rang and we were given an anniversary cake with a handwritten note. She remembered what I said and they processed the cake perfectly.
We had our anniversary dinner at Cowrie Cove, and Jessica and Erwin helped make our anniversary dinner perfect. Jessica helped picked the right food, we had grilled shrimp and clams and we were stuffed from the tasty food. We were given a table beside the water and it was soo romantic. The ambiance, the food, the staff... Perfect!
The next day we went snorkeling and saw 1000's of fish.
We had breakfast at Tides and there were lots of good choices. The tables were quickly filled but we managed a table facing the pool and the view was wonderful.

Shangrila has always been special for us. We got married at the Edsa Shangrila and have spent many nights there.
It was our first time in Shangrila Mactan and it did not disappoint!
Its more expensive than other resorts in Cebu, but its not the most expensive, but boy do you get the best possible service and place for what you pay. Well worth our stay and was a great highlight to our trip.",Food:Location:Staff

"Stayed and got married in shangri la mactan cebu in 2015. Our stay was pretty decent. Great service from staff but there were mishaps here and there. The worst part was organizing the wedding. Most of it was done via e-mails and phone calls since we are overseas. It was very slack service for a 5 star place. It was a horrible and very stressful 6 months or so experience for us trying to keep in touch with the person who was supposed to be helping us organise the wedding. At times it would take her a week or so to reply to our emails that we ended up ringing a lot just to confirm whats going on. At the end all they could say was sorry for the inconvenience. No compensation or anything! And after the wedding, I also had my wedding dress dry cleaned... but had to send it back twice as it was not cleaned properly. Eventually just had to take the dress and refund as we were tight in time and had to go.

For the hassle and amount of money we spent there, we were expecting for some sort of compensation.

So, no. I am not recommending this place to anyone I know or will we ever come back to this place again.",Staff
"Arriving at the Shangri La in Cebu at first I will admit my expectattions were set extremely high.

As Shangri La is a well known hotel group and the Shangri La in Dubai is beyond breath taking.

So arriving at first I was a little taken back by how outdated the entire ambiance of the hotel is in terms of interiors and carpet going on.
We stayed on the beach view room with views of the entire resort and view of the beach too which was nice for great views.
The bed was lovely and everything was well cleaned the only thing is that in general the hotel has a damp odour I think this is because it is an old hotel here and good do with some
remodelling.
The Staff were extremely helpful and attentive. We came to Cebu specifically for diving and we tend to enjoy renting a helicopter which we spend quite a bit to get this service only to wake up the next day to be told the helicopter could not pick us up directly from the hotel and we needed to wake up earlier to catch the helicopter at the airport if we wanted to make it in time for our dive! We paid a lot and only expected to get the service we wanted unfortunately that was not possible hopefully they can sort this out if they wish to offer a luxury service. The flight there was great safe and perfect landing.

As a whole its not worth paying that amount of money to stay here you are better off staying elsewhere if you are looking to pay for luxury but if you are looking for a laid back beach vibe then this is the place to go do not have high expectations as I did. As paying the amount we did we expected the same for what we paid so I would say not really value for money",Value for money:Location
"I Always love going back to Shangrila as often as I can and you should too. Guestroom service, cleansheets, service is par excellence. Breakfaat buffet at Tides is my all time favorite.

"Cebu is a beautiful place, however when travelling with a 7month old child, you need to think of staying in a place that is clean, baby friendly and has access to clean water for baby milk and/or baby food.
Shangrila resort in Macatan was able to accommodate all our needs. We always received extra complementary bottled water for the little one, babysitting service is also available at a reasonable rate, baby food was not available, they could prepare anything you ask for.

Most of the restaurants had breakfast buffet with both western and eastern choices.

The resort has baby swimming pool, arcades, activity indoor park for both babies and children.

It also has a medical clinic should anything happen to you or your baby.

This resort is recommended for families, as the resort is filled with kids, so it is easier to have your kids/babies play around and meet other kids/babies from around the world.

I would not recommend this place as a honeymoon destination, out of the amount of children there, but it is a good place to stay in.

Having a baby makes it difficult to move outside the resort so we stayed in. There is one shop with limited items, but it does not have any items for babies such as babyshampoo, oils, nappies or other items should you run out. The nearest supermarket is about 20-25min drive from the resort.

The choice of food and restaurants is alright, but given the size, I would accept a couple more restaurants or cafes.

Should you forget your swimwear or sandles, there are shops available for purchase.

Otherwise,reasonable sized gym, big pools, private beach.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This place is OK, the room and decor is a little outdated and overdone. I am here for business and the company I work with offered to put me up here for a night. This is definitely more of a family resort a-la Disney. Lots of activities, an indoor play structure, multiple pools & a nice beach area. Currently listening to some obnoxious drum music from some kind of outdoor performance. It just doesn't feel like an authentic philippines experience like the other resorts I visited while here on Cebu. (Blue Orchid Moal Boal, White Sands Cebu) Maybe it would be more desirable if I came with kids, but every pool was full of people, mostly screaming kids. Not very relaxing. I also tried their salon services, scheduled a 1:30 waxing appointment. They were 30 mins late to start, which was pretty rude since I had scheduled an appointment ahead of time to avoid having to wait. The waxing job was pretty half assed too, not impressed, and it was the same price I would pay in the states for an impeccable job. Before I was staying at White Sands Cebu, which is gorgeous, modern, understated. I wish I could have stayed another night but they were booked up.",Comfort & Facilities

We stayed much of our time in one of the pools and the pool attendant was super attentive. He even went to the extent of bringing us some ice wrapped in towels to cool us off from the scorching heat of the sun. It is a great place to spend more quality time with your family, from fish feeding to aqua adventure activities.

"Great stay with kids. Took our four year old here for the xmas break. Took the lounge option which I think was worthwhile to avoid the crowds elsewhere, especially at breakfast. The free cheese, drinks etc in the afternoon are also good.
The resort has good facilities for kids. The pool play areas and slides are a lot of fun, as too is the children's play room. My child enjoyed this a lot.
Beach was fine. Sand is a bit coarse and the area is a bit limited, but overall we were satisfied.
Restaurants were pretty good, though we grew a bit tired after a while. - this is normal for anywhere we stay.
Staff were good and attentive, and we were very satisfied with their level of service.
Used the gym a few times and found it pretty good in terms of the facilities - cardio, some free weights, machines.
In sum, probably one of the better places in Asia as a resort hotel with kids.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed here during the Ironman event. The most we had to wait for a table was 15 minutes. I was very impressed with how well everything was managed. We dined and Tides and Acqua (both had gluten free options). We were also able to order from the in-room dining menu. We arrived a couple days early, so there were more in-room dining options than were available during the Ironman event.

We ordered a room for 3 adults and 1 child with the option for one rollaway bed for the 3rd adult. The extra person charge was 2450₽.

Sleeping arrangements: 3 stars One down-side was the king-sized bed. It was actually two beds pushed together and the mattress was a little too hard. When we checked in I asked the staff to make sure the bed was solid because I didn't want our toddler to sleep on a crack. They assured me that it wouldn't be an issue and that the bed was solid, but when we got to the room, there was a very noticeable crack between the mattresses and since the hotel was at capacity there were no other options.

Amenities: 5 stars. Beach access, the pool, the fun zone, and the splash pad was amazing. Our almost 2-year-old was very entertained. I read reviews on here and came prepared with a long-sleeved shirt and socks for the little one.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff

"Couldn't have picked a better choice for our honeymoon. The staff were so helpful right from the start, as soon as we emailed them. And once they learned we were on our honeymoon, they threw in a few more small touches that we really appreciated.

They had their own area of the beach which was really good for enjoying the beach and not having to worry about venturing too far away into the water. You can go snorkeling, kayaking, and even feed the fish.

The structure is very well-maintained throughout the years. Staff are very well trained. Location was really great -- a direct flight to Cebu from Manila, without having to transfer, and there's a shuttle between the airport and hotel.

Though the resort is a bit of a distance to Cebu City, they have shuttle buses to and from SM Cebu and Ayala Center. Not that you would need, nor want, to go to the city. The resort has activities geared for all ages, and even has a play area designed for kids.

There are also golf carts available should you want to take a tour around the resort.

Breakfast was superb. There was a variety of dishes from different parts of the world. I loved breakfast, especially danggit (salted, sun-dried rabbitfish). Every single day.

There were also a lot of restaurants within the resort.

They had the Adventure zone for the kids, craft activities, snorkling/kayaking, etc. Their pool area is quite big as well, with many different sections, so you don't feel as if it's crowded that much. We weren't able to go out of the resort and so we tried most of their restaurants inside. It's pricey, but not bad. Maybe the only negative comment that i have is probably the fees that they charge for a shuttle to the city. I feel it's quite expensive, and they don't have promos for families or anything like that. Overall, we had a very nice stay with the kids.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We stayed for four nights as a family of three. With an infant child of 18 months, this is a very convenient place to stay.

As we booked the Ocean Wing, a perk is airport shuttle, saving a few pesos, but whether it offsets against cost of staying in the Main Wing I'm not sure. Check in was smooth enough and our room was ready slightly earlier than the advertised time, which was good.

The room was modern enough and comfortably sized, although with the cot we requested, it reduced the size a little. There was a balcony and a sea view, but we didn't book a room with that view specifically, just luck of the building orientation and coastline. The bathroom was standard, with the usual fixtures and amenities you would expect from a hotel of this standard.

In addition to the cot, they provided a bottle steamer & tub for my child, as well as additional bottles of water to prepare milk, which was a nice gesture.

Facilities were really good for kids, my child live the Toddler Zone soft play area and the scheduled activities kept it entertained. I made use of the scheduled activities for adults as well. Having a beach as part of the resort is great as well, with clear water and lots of marine life.

We were able to breakfast at Tides or Acqua, from staying at the Ocean Wing. Going to the latter is a little quieter and preferred for us, if the food choice is lesser. Eating here isn't the best value for money but you're paying for the convenience and the food is of good standard.

A really good time was had here. Rooms and amenities could be improved upon given the price you pay, but making use of the facilities and activities makes it up for value.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"How i wish i have gone to this resort earlier in my life. From the time they pick you up at the airport to the time they bring you back is such an amazing experience.

When we arrived, we were immediately brought to the club lounge of the ocean wing and you could see from the facilities and the view that our 3 days will be awesome. The room was very spacious and comfortable with all the comforts you expect from a shangrila resort.

Lunching at Aqcua makes you feel like you can't wait to try their other restaurants. Seeing the view from the resto makes you want to dive in the pool fronting it. Dinner at The Cowrie with the sun setting was a perfect way to relax with family. Breakfast at The Tides will fill you up till lunchtime almost.

The Chi Spa is another world and one should not miss. Believe me it's quite the perfect ending for each day. We had the 1.5 hour massage the first night then a facial on the second. Both truly perfect!

The white sand beach and pools are very accessible and the resort provides everything to make you enjoy it every second of your stay. All the water sports, mini golf, tennis court, pool slides, kids' play area, various activities like cooking for the kids, ice cream store, gym, etc makes this resort perfect for the family, couples and everyone.

To top it all - the whole staff were just so friendly, accommodating and will go out of their way to make your stay truly perfect! Thank you and you guys are just amazing!!! Next visit, i will never leave the resort at all!!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"The hotel is massive. We've been to Shangrila Boracay and Sentosa, and this seems to be the biggest one. Too bad we didn't have time to explore all the restos and amenities, since we only stayed overnight.

The rooms are what you'd expect from Shangrila. We chose the Ocean Wing, and it's only now that I realise this isn't the refurbished side of the hotel. The rooms did feel a bit dated (but still comfortable), and I still liked the Ocean Wing since it was so close to the pools and beach.

The beach and hotel area were fun. The marine sanctuary (setup 2007) was a pleasant surprise. Robert was able to snorkel, and he was impressed with the fish.

The food was yummy. We had room service (bulgogi and spaghetti), and had buffet at Tides. Wish we had time to try their roast chicken and pork. Lots of reasons to go back!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Your best asset is your people. warm sincere and very caring. from making the reservation to checking in and checking out everything was efficiently handled . our room was very clean smell very fresh, we enjoyed the marine sanctuary safari tour very much and Lourds and her partner the big guy , sorry forgot his name, was very attentive and we learn a lot from her and from the snorkling tour.",Staff:Cleanliness
The foods are overpriced. The room they gave us was avaraged. Not good. The housekeeping are too noisy. All I can hear is they are yelling outside our room. My question is. Do they really do that all the time while they doing cleaning? Me and my wife was not happy. We can't sleep. And not peaceful stay. Sorry,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I was there for a conference in Cebu at MovenPick but stayed at Shangrila. The service is excellent. The resort is very similar to the Rasa Sentosa Singapore. The rooms are a little tired and I would have expected the toilet to be much better. I think more than any other place, one tends to chill out in the room and the resort a lot more. The breakfast for vegetarians was not impressive. I would have expected a lot more there. However, a lovely resort for the family and the kids would love this place. I dont know the pricing of Movenpick, but I found that hotel to be amazing as well. If it is cheaper to stay there, then I may well pick that hotel over Shangrila. The poolside at Shangrila is good and also the beach. Watersports there are expensive.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We have just returned from Cebu where we stayed 5 nights at the Shangri La with two small kids 7&5.

Our initial impression of the hotel is that it is big, there are 500 odd rooms but during our stay we never felt crowded by the pool or beach and always had our favoured outside table at the restaurant although there did seem a lot more people there on Saturday and Sunday than midweek.

We had a family room in the main wing which was great and a separate little living room off a large main room with 2 doubles and a single additional bed added then made it a little snug but ok for us. Room quality and bathroom was pretty good (we understand that the newer ocean wing is in better nick) and we had no issues with music or noise and were very happy in the main wing.

We ate at Tides, the main buffet restaurant for three of the nights. The buffet is pretty extensive and aims to cater for the main clientele of the hotel who seem to be from Japan and Korea and of course the Philippines with some good western choices too. We were able to sample some varying cuisine and give the kids an insight into other cultural food types. The kids buffet is aimed at younger kids and our two were happy to dip in and out of it. The cost is quite high but with kids eating free and the huge choice it is actually a good option. The wine and beer buffet options are okay with some reasonable house wines available. We ate A le Carte there one night which was okay.

Breakfast is great and we were so well looked after with Darren the service manager doing magic tricks for the kids each morning and all the staff so helpful and polite.

Aqua is nice, much quieter after the crowds of Tides and a great Italian menu with huge pizzas.

The pools are both good and have varying depths. The main pool is large and has a nice tame water slide at one end which my boy loved.

The beach is well maintained and well serviced with sun beds and umbrellas. The kids loved feeding the fish and the marine park was surprisingly good for snorkelling. We did not use the kayaks or jet skis etc - if you plan to use them a lot I'd suggest getting a package.

We used the badminton, ping pong and crazy golf which the kids loved but as the weather was fantastic the whole week, we did not put the kids into the soft play and would never let them play on the video games in eZone but if that's your thing then it's there.

The most noticeable positive of the resort is the staff; every single member of staff from gardener to waiter to head chef we saw said hello and took an interest, really fantastic. They were also very kid friendly and made us feel really welcome at all times.

The grounds were well manicured and pretty for a pre-dinner stroll to the beach bar for cocktails and sundowners.

All in all a nice hotel for a break with good facilities and very family friendly. Initial concerns about holiday in Cebu in the wet season proved unfounded but perhaps we were lucky.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"When I go homecoming, this resort has it all and the facilities are awesome and great scale for a mactan resort. Food is amazing, beach is nice and clean, serene. Its natural instead of a cement block of facilities. Even though my experience with the chinese resto was not to its standards due to the 1 hr wait and disorganized sequence of serving of maindish/ appetizer/ soup. The rest of the service and staff was outstanding...thus I still give a 5!!!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at this hotel for a week, even though it's a little bit pricey, as we are very curious to see the beauty of this hotel. The hotel is a little bit of rundown. We stayed at the Ocean Wing Panorama, the room was a let down. The showers was not working properly, saw 1 or 2 cockroaches in the bathroom area. I must've been blind or need to wear my glasses but I couldn't find a power point in the bathroom to dry my hair,so I have to do my hair where the bed is, and it wakes up my son all the time. The sliding door to the terrace doesn't have a handle so it was quite difficult for us to open or close the door and that was frustrating.
The breakfast at the Ocean Club was fantastic they a lot of variety of Filipino dishes ( I always love the bud bud and puto maya with manggo and hot chocolate) and the restaurant staff of are very helpful. We had our dinner at Tides. The food was not that good for the hefty price, and no restaurant staff can be found ( when we asked for water it took ages to arrived) and it is seems like the staff has a limited time to smile, couldn't see anyone who smiled at this restaurant. ( they should learn from the Ocean Club restaurant staff).
The only best thing that we liked in this hotel is their amazing garden, the kids swimming pool and the mini arcade that my son loved it so much. The fish feeding was great and lots of fun.
The check in and check out staff are excellent and very accommodating. Special mention to Diana she was great and very cheerful.
Would we stay at this hotel again? Maybe, just maybe.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I love the brand hotels in other places and expected the same quality from this one so I booked without a second thought and even suggested it to my friends. The SERVICE and food is legendary at other Shangri La hotels and I have stayed at 3 of their other locations.

They have excellent breakfast buffet and great restaurants and bar by the water.

"Overall my friend and I had an enjoyable trip. The grounds, the pools, the beach and lobby of the hotel are beautiful. The rooms on the other hand are quite tired. The rooms could really do with a facelift, especially the carpets which are quite stained.

Overall the staff were very friendly and helpful. I felt though that the management are probably letting the hotel down and the staff are trying to make up for it. Just one example, two times We went for lunch in the lobby and the meals took over 40 mins to come. The second time the staff warned us that it would take a long time. I asked if there was another restaurant I could go to. At that time, 3pm, they said no. Seems surprising that a five star resort can't come up with a meal at that time without having to prepare their diner for a long wait. The staff were extremely apologetic and kindly gave me dessert for free, but the management should really make sure they don't have to rely on their staff bribing their clientele to make them happy. A few other things were a bit disappointing, for example not getting two bed room as requested, but overall the staff and the settling make up for it. Don't think I would be back though. I certainly wouldn't pay extra for a room in the ocean wing which was, as I said, a bit tired and a bit disappointing.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"There are not enough words in the dictionary to describe the quality of service, the level of care, and how to describe the Shangri-La Mactan Hotel as a Ideal Place for Rest and Relaxation.
Just spent an awesome nine day family vacation in Cebu, and this was our second Shangri-La Hotel experience (our first, and I reviewed it several years ago, was the Shangri-La Bangkok). Shangri-La truly stands by its name as one of the top hotels.

I cannot say enough about the quality of care we received as guests in the Mactan hotel. All the staff - and I mean ""ALL THE STAFF"", were extremely warm, receptive, and so friendly. After one day of dining in the hotel restaurant (Tides), several staff members already knew us by name, including our favorite beverages, and even our length of stay. Have to add this too -- NONE of this was based on any monetary tip they received from us. A big shout-out to the Tides Manager Jun, his staff that included Carl, Paolo, and my favorite, Nova. Our Room Service personnel were also top notch. Another big shout-out to the staff at the beach cafe.
Summary -- TOP NOTCH STAFF.

Hotel Stay -- if you have little kids, stay in the Main Wing, as it has easy access to the slide pool. If traveling with grown-ups, stay in the Ocean Wing.

Amenities -- Shangri-La Mactan has an awesome beach with tons of play activities for all ages. We never used the hotel pools, but there is a pool geared for kids as it has an awesome slide. We took advantage of just about all of the hotel amenities, including the Jet-Skis, kayak, snorkeling, and para-sailing. All delivered as promised, and all left us with fond memories. The beach cafe is great, as is the staff. One secret -- there is a secluded area on the beach called Paradise. Find it, and you will not want to leave it.
For after-dinner relaxation, we either walked on the beautiful hotel campus, or hung out at the E-ZONE that has access to pool (billiards), air hockey, and various other arcade games.
Our preferred place for hotel dining was TIDES, although the Aqua Restaurant and Tea of Spring Restaurants were awesome as well. Again, I cannot say enough about the Staff. TIDES also serves an EXCELLENT breakfast and dinner buffet.

For near-by restaurants - we dined at near-by Giuseppe Pizzeria, and Fiesta Bay (for Filipino food). We visited both restaurants twice each, so that should say enough about how good the food was at both. At Giuseppe - try the pizza, and you will be surprised. At Fiesta Bay -- try the pork bbq and the chorizo sisig. Fiesta Bay may not serve authentic Filipino food, but it is good enough.

My wife, who is Filipino by the way, was disappointed in that she never ate REAL Filipino food during her stay in Cebu. Sad to say, access to real Filipino food was limited, even at the hotel.

By the way, there is a hotel car, for a small fee, that will take you to and from either of these restaurants. The path from the hotel to these restaurants is not well lit at night.

There is also a Hotel Shuttle bus that will take you to the two big shopping malls on the island.

We really wanted to experience real Cebu street food at night, (as we have experienced in other countries), but the Hotel did not want to risk our safety. I do not blame them.

Tours -- we booked a tour to Bohol, and another to the Whale Shark Experience - all through the hotel. All delivered as promised. Since our vacation package included breakfast, the hotel even packed us a To-Go Breakfast on our tour that left at 5:30 in the morning.
Be advised - the Whale Shark Tour is a 13-hour tour that starts with a 5:30 a.m. hotel pick-up, and after a long 4 hour drive to the location, our experience in the water was limited to barely 30 minutes. If you are lucky, a whale shark may actually swim close enough to you for a picture. We were one of the lucky few. But if crowded, good luck.
The tour to Bohol included a visit to the Tarsier Conservation Area, the Loboc River Cruise - a lunch cruise, and the Chocolate Hills. All were a treat, and all left us with unforgettable memories.

The icing on our vacation cake -- during our last breakfast at Tides, some of the staff got together and presented us with a bouquet of roses, and a chocolate cake as a way of saying THANK-YOU for staying with them, I know my wife, my son, and I were very friendly and appreciative to all the staff during our dining visits, (heck, I would even hug all the staff members) and that is why this final treat. Again, none of this was tip based.

All in all -- I would recommend Shangri-La Mactan in a heart beat, and I look forward to our next Shangri-La stay in another country.",Food:Staff:Location
"I could rave about Shangri-La to anybody and everybody I know! First of all, service is impeccable here. All - and I mean ALL - the staff are very good-natured, everybody is very polite and greets you with a smile, attends to your whims and always make sure you get the best experience. I thoroughly enjoy their food...omg they have the best breakfast buffet ever! and I highly recommend it to people who are looking for a resort to stay or visit to. Shangri-La definitely lives up to being a 5 star resort. Grounds are well kempt, amenities are up to date and modern, rooms always clean. Everything you are looking for is pretty much here especially service wise. They have multilingual staff and everybody speaks English so communication is never really an issue. I had my Wedding reception held here too and staff was amazing especially Ms. Maureen Rendon. She was always quick to respond to my messages, was very patient in answering all my questions and made the process, from start to finish, very smooth. These are just a few of the many good things Shangri-La and their staff can and will offer. Definitely a place I'd come back to when I visit Cebu and always a place I brag about.

"Stayed here for a couple days and it was perfect for what we wanted. We were told there would be too many kids but that was not the issue when we visited. Very good deals on Alcohol, good facilities, easy enough to get a spot by the pool. Service by the pool was very good, snorkeling was fun, do not expect a huge beach but it was good. Had a blip with the Manager in the restaurants where we were not given a table and then later informed kitchen was overfull, we walked to the other restaurant and the manager came round and apologized and took care of our dinner which was a nice touch. Ideal for a 2-3 days to relax, you do not need to leave the resort. Room is comfortable, cannot really find many faults though it lacked something for the price it demands in Philippines and I cannot put my finger on it. I would not be running back to Cebu but if i did i probably might try something else.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Recently every year we have stayed at Shangri-la Mactan for a short vacation, and it's because it's really the best overall, especially for families.

This time we stayed at the Ocean Wing, which is more private. I much prefer the Main Wing rooms since it's closer to where the pool and kids zones are (with toddler in tow).

What I like about the resort is the overall service and amenities. You can stay here the whole time and have fun. Rooms are big, clean, and comfortable. Service is friendly and accommodating. Food is excellent, something worth going to even if you're not staying here. Our toddler enjoyed the Kids Zone and Adventure Zone, and also swimming at the pool and with the fishes in the beach.

The shuttle to and from the malls travels every hour, giving guests flexible options with timing.

"Pros > breakfast and polite attentive staffs. Pools and beach area are still incomparable to other resorts. Rooms are huge and good view in our ocean wing room.

Cons> I think this hotel needs renovation since toilets are not as good and credible anymore. There are some minor problems like leaks and damaged tub control since I think it's still the same as the time it opened. Staffs are so attentive that they clean the tables very fast during breakfast time and thinks we are already done with our breakfast even if we haven't eve touched our coffee and mango juice.

Room service are so fast cleaning the room ordered food that I haven't even finished the coffee yet they already cleaned up the room.

"The resort is very close to the airport, only 15 mins car drive. Room is very spacious and absolutely clean. We stayed at Ocean Wing, which is quieter than at the main wing. Breakfast is served at both Ocean Wing and Main Wing but the main wing has much more food choice.
What I love the most is the beach, white sand and crystal clear water. Its a bit crowded on weekend. The sun rises very early in Cebu. You can go to the beach at 6am and have the whole beach for yourself. And its very safe also. The resort provides life-vest and there are enough life-guards to watch out for you.
I really enjoyed my stay there.
It was almost perfect except for little bit hiccup during the check-in. We booked the couple retreat package which includes complimentary welcome drink and praline, one set-meal dinner for 2 and some other activities. However, when we arrived and check-in, the receptionist didn't explain anything. She just gave us the resort map. Until we told her that we booked the package, she just printed from computer a list activities included in the package, without any explanation. There was no welcome drink in the room until we called and asked for it. It would be nicer if the staff was more attentive and informative during check-in because its the first impression when the guests arrive at the hotel.",Food:Staff

"Beautiful resort, excellent for families with children. The resort is huge with plenty to do, breakfast and dinner at the Tides restaurant was amazing, with a very good spread of international dishes. The resort had a family fun package promo at the check in which saved us $$$ in food and activities.

The cons, the service on average was excellent, but a bit inconsistent in places. When I arrive to the Buko Bar for a drink, four waiting staff just stared and ignored me, without offering me a table, menu or just inquire if I needed any help. Bad start. Also on the first night at dinner at the Tides, the waitress forgot our drinks order...we were waiting 20 mins before complaining. Special thanks to Carl, who dealt with the issue promptly and made extra effort to attend to our table throughout the night after the earlier mishap. Dinner was excellent at Tides, but I would suggest Management improve labelling their dishes, the dishes are anonymous at times and the current format to list all the dishes on a single card, doesnt always work. I spent a few moments each time to ask ""whats this one....Whats this?

I would give 4.5 stars, due to the let down of service at a few places in the resort and poor labelling of the dinner buffet. But overall it was an enjoyable stay and we will come back.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

Swimming pool are great and the beach very nice, especially the snorkeling in front of the hotel is wonderful.

Main wing is perfect for 2 adults and one kid. If you have 2 kids, you should prefer Ocean wing because a sofa is transformed into a bed for 2 children.

We had dinner at Tides, plenty of selection, from Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, European, etc.
If you opt to a bit quieter pool, go to Acqua pool. There will be kids, but a little less than the main pool where the water play area for the kids is.

"When taking the hotel shuttle to the resort or when visiting the nearby islands, you'll likely see or encounter kids living in extreme poverty. I regret not bringing some small gifts to give these kids, perhaps something educational to offer them.

While I visited the resort for a wedding, I think my kids would have an awesome time at this resort. However, it's not a place to visit for couples. If you don't have kids, spend your money on boutique resorts where you can enjoy a peaceful environment.

The food is excellent at the resort, though I think the local food is lacking a bit compared to Thai cuisine. Of the two breakfast restaurants, Aqua offers a more relaxing environment (though less variety).

Overall, you really can't go wrong at the Shangri-La, and the service level was outstanding. Be happy that you're able to afford to stay there. Plenty of people outside the hotel gates are not as lucky.",Food
"We were able to check-in early and got upgraded to executive floor. It was my first time to stay in a Shangri-La Hotel/Resort and it was really great!!! The whole resort was really beautiful! A lot of restaurants and activities to choose from. The staffs were polite, friendly and helpful. I would love to visit this lovely resort again. Wifi was available throughout the resort area.",Staff:Location:Food

"Even with other new competition in the area, Shangrila Mactan remains to be the best in the island. Stayed here again for a weekend escape after trying the other resorts nearby and still find this the most relaxing place with its much bigger space, best amenities and facilities to keep you occupied with different activities, many food choices from its numerous resto outlets, better breakfast buffet and better white beach area with its rich marine life. Very ideal escape for friends and family. It also helps a great deal it is just a few minutes from the Mactan airport, a big plus for those who prefer shorter travels.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I tagged my friend on my long vacation. We decided to book an overnight stay at Shangri-La's Mactan Resort and Spa. We didn't regret that we upgraded our room where we have an access in Ocean Club Lounge.

There was a long queue on front desk and since I was a Golden Circle Member, I was immediately assisted by Veronica Cimafranca, the Front Desk Manager. I feel the VIP treatment and I'm so grateful that she allowed us to check in early and had a late check out. Since our flight was after midnight, she even allowed us to stay at the VIP Lounge after check out and have full access on amenities. Special thanks to the staff of Ocean Club Lounge for their assistance. We receieved an impeccable service and above and beyond for us.

The room in Ocean Club is fantastic and has an amazing beach view. It has a breatht aking view of the ocean. We were given luxe toiletries and the amenities are complete. The linens and sheets are clean. Staff were so courteous and kind to their guests.

Downside:
-the food (hash brown potatoes) and hot chocolate is bland at Tides (breakfast buffet)
-the place is crowded and cant easily move - Tides (breakfast buffet)
-no welcome note or simple gift for Golden Circle Member guest
-found pierced on lower portion of bathrobe",Staff:Food
This is my 4th time in shangrila mactan. The place is lovely. I love the white sand beach. They have nice swimming pools. Kids will really really enjoy the place. But what I liked about shangrila is the costumer service. They go out of their way to pleased their clients. The supervisor in tides restaurant named Guia gave us the best serviced. Thank you very much Guia for the hospitality you showed us!,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We really enjoyed our 2-night stay in the hotel. We took the family fun package.
The buffet selection is excellent except for the disappointment we experienced during our first day breakfast buffet. I'm not sure if it was due to the staff's confusion but we were told that the free flow drinks were not included in our package. We only knew about it when we had our 2nd breakfast buffet because my friend's family joined us (who also took the family fun package). We informed the reception and expected a minor compensation for that - but none. I even sent that feedback via their website - but I did not get any response from them. Well, for a 5-star hotel, we were hoping for a better response for their staff's ""confusion"".
By the way, when we were told by the waiting staff who served us during the first breakfast buffet that free-flow drinks were not included, I didn't have time to double check the terms and conditions of our package in their website that time because we have two toddlers to look after. I just trusted them since I've given them our room number already.
Despite this disappointing experience, overall, it was a great place for family.",Staff:Food:Value for money

"Spent the night here after a whirlwind tour of Cebu and its surrounding islands. My friend said it was ""the vacation after the vacation"". We only spent 1 night, but it was sure worth the upgrade. The additional cost allowed us early check-in, drinks and snacks at the club floor, free use of non-motorized water activities and the use of the Chi Water Spa. We had a weekday stay and although it was Philippine summer, we never felt overcrowded by other guests. The house reef is great for kids, I was able to see fish just by standing in the water by the shore. It was no more than shin deep. I would definitely stay again and stay longer.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

The Shangri-la Mactan resort is everything we needed. We have spent one week there and all we found was amazing...
The resort is big but we have never felt under pressure or never seen crowdy places.
The restaurants are very good the breathfast definetely worth the stay, the buffet restaurant (Tides) is just wonderful for kids and is really price valuable!!!
We were staying in the Ocean wing, very close from the beautiful quiet pool.
Facilities are very good and Wi-Fi ia available everywhere in the resort even at the beach...
The Spa (Chi) was a real pleasure and we have had wonderful time during massage at the outside cabanes...

"What can I say? Only superlatives. Been coming to this hotel resort and I always feel at home.

Last Sunday, we checked-in with other family friends and we had great time together. Firstly, our rooms were upgraded to Ocean Wing, all of us. Secondly, we were given late check-out time for the following day. No charge at all! Thanks, Shangri-la!

Our room in the corner has the biggest space, except for the ocean-facing rooms with bigger terraces. I'll ask for the corner room next time.

The pools caters to kids and adults alike. They have shallow pools for little kids and play-places. They have deeper pools for adults and advanced swimmers.

There's nothing that you would want in a resort hotel that they don't have here. recreation rooms...they have. Jungle gym for kids...small and bigger, they have.

The staff are truly world-class in their service, from the front desk to the people handing you your towel. I'm proud to be a Filipino with these guys. The food in the restaurant are international. No worries about it, really!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"This really is the best place in Cebu to just relax, unwind, decompress and rejuvenate. Food at the Cowrie Cove is generally good, but then I always ask the wait staff what their favorites are, and they have never been wrong yet. The buffet breakfast at the Tides is hands down the best in Cebu. Filipino, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese staples. If you need to eat lunch after breakfast at the Tides, something is seriously wrong with your body. Sea view rooms obviously better than the garden rooms. Lastly, valet parking is free.",Food:Location
My friends wedding was hosted here and the place was incredible. The views to the beach are amazing and the food was on another level.

"Shangri-La Mactan Resort & Spa, located in Cebu, Philippines
Coming from South Africa where we have beautiful oceans, plenty of fish and beautiful beaches, I was not sure what to expect. Our 7 night stay was beautiful we were given a room overlooking the ocean and pool area, room was nice comfortable, clean with a great view. The hotel is very large and very well maintained secure and staff are helpful. From collection at airport, greeted by a host of individuals all trying to ensure you’re welcome to their hotel. Bags are taken to your room with no wait. Offered cool drinks and everyone is smiling.
The hotel is one of largest beach resorts I have ever stayed in. Made use of the gym was excellent Enjoyed two wonderful YOGA session brilliant instructor with great insight. My spa treatment was the best I have ever had. Was wonderful to relax at the Chi Spa pool lying in the sun not a soul to be seen. Sauna and Steam room afterwards. Breakfast is served in two buffet areas, we preferred Aqua as it was a lot quieter, and the second buffet area was very busy and very overwhelming so early in the day. Gluten free eats where available. Lunch at the beach bar restaurant was wonderful, cocktails where delicious. Chinese restaurant was a bit disappointing to many children late at night, lights to bright, food was great pricey for what was served. The pavilion restaurant overlooking the ocean was brilliant, the food was out of this world and the staff where extremely accommodating, helpful, I dined two nights alone as my husband was on conference and they were wonderful.
The weather was great, warm sun warm water and a lovely breeze, the beach is really nice and one of the things I really liked. There's plenty of shade, a beach bar and snorkelling. It's a pretty cove and you can see fish when you just stand in the water. Loved feeding the fish, Did a boat trip through the dive centre with snorkelling for the morning was beautiful to sail out just my hubby and myself with crew awesome experience. Marine life is excellent and very diverse

Customer service was excellent. Everyone speaks English so there is no communication problem. All you need to do is ask and your requests will be granted. Everyone is always. The Filipinos are noted for their warmth and caring manners, at the Shangri-La in Cebu they never missed a beat.
We had a really great stay here, the staff were lovely and well trained. Suggestion maybe have some areas in restaurants for adults only who are looking for a quiet dinner.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Wow. it was the most amazing 5 nights I've had in Asia! The Shangri- la Mactan is very safe, so it was perfect for me and my girl friend. Service was top notch and facilities were very well maintained and a big variation of activities to select from! Once we landed, we got to the hotel via the shuttle bus ( super recommended, in case you get ripped off by local cab drivers and its more safe!) We stayed at the main building which was close to the beach and had a very nice sea view from our balcony although check in process could be faster. Air con was full blast, free fruits & mangoes every day after house keeping. There are two breakfast buffets to choose from. Two big pools & the beach just 3 mins walk from the room.Towel huts everywhere and you can easily order drinks and snacks from all the bars/ beach huts , chairs.

There's so much to do and places for you to lay around and just chill. Exactly what we were looking for in this trip. There are a list of free activities everyday where guests can sign up and join.We went snorkelling with a bunch of other hotel guests, the instructor brought food for us to feed the fishes, just within 10 mins away from the shore, you can already see SO MANY pretty fishes. The instructor gave us a short session of what fishes there are and we swam around within the area together. There are also yoga, tennis, diving basics, chess , etc sessions. Some are paid events but very minimal cost. It feels like you are at a club-med. You don't need to leave the complex at all as there are quite many restaurants within the property. Plus, the Shangri la is the nicest property out of the entire area, you really wouldn't head off to the neighbour hotels for f&b choices..: )

We were lucky enough to have the club access , so everyday we would head over for apero and some snacks before we go for dinner. In my opinion, Philippine cuisine isn't the best you can find in Asia , but theres' a good selection of restaurants in the hotel.

The spa was really good as well, not too expensive compared to other hotel charges. I got a facial + massage ( 2 hrs ) and it was around 100 USD in total. You can use the spa facility throughout the stay if you have a spa booking within your trip. There goes the sauna & steam room and a massage pool.

There are some special philipino event nights where there's a show and dancers perform while you have your bbq dinner which was delish! I really enjoyed my stay. and would definitely come back. There were many families and couples but I'd say the hotel is friends friendly also as its just a place for people to relax and chill from the busy city life styles.

If you want to go diving, there's a diving centre in the hotel but its quite pricey. You can head off to these local diving centres 5-10 mins walk from the hotel for a cheaper package! The diving scene is so spectacular, I was speechless. Water was super clear and calm.

One last thing to mention which i was just so so so impressed. THE ENTIRE PROPERTY INCLUDING BEACH AREA HAD SUPER UNBELIEVABLY GOOD WIFI RECEPTION!!!! I felt so safe and happy being connected whereever i was, cause I also had to stream my music via wifi : )

Totally in love with this hotel & the staffs!!! I tried to tip the housekeeping staff but he was so honest, he refused my tip. Perhaps its a hotel policy. From a hotelier background, I was really impressed with my stay. Price was very affordable for the service and experience I got.

It's the place to be. I never imagined philipines could give me such a memorable experience!!!",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"To end out honeymoon at this resort was perfect! Very good restaurants to choose from on your doorstep. Different tours to pick and choose from, we choose the twin city tour, and what a surprise, learnt a little bit more of the history! Very good snorkeling spot, service is excellent, people are friendly, very nice spa and not to far from the airport! The only thing they need to upgrade in the ocean wing is the shower/bath combo, when you pay that price, you want a big shower or a corner bath, not a combo.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Value for money

Nothing was too much effort for any staff member we interacted with. We were there for almost a week and didn't leave the resort once - just too much too do and we had everything we wanted (or needed).
I would recommend this resort for families with children - they cater strongly for this group with many activities for children. We don't have children and still managed to relax. Although you could hear the children in the swimming pool at 6 am!!! But even this wasn't something a minded a bit.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
Shangrila Mactan never lets me down in terms of its services and facilities. Special mention on the assistance of Myres Llido of Shangrila. Here's a tip - always call before checking in to avoid the long wait.,Staff:Location
"This is best physical property in Mactan, and usual Shangri-La level of service. I feel a bit like a Grinch, because I was traveling on business, and this is not a hotel for business traveller, or couples. It was full of kids, families, all having a great time- and for them this would be great. If you are not keen on kids running up and down your hall, maybe not for you. Also, very expensive for the value provided, these are North American rates (450 USD for ordinary room) in a country where they pay the hotel workers about 10 dollars a day.",Value for money
"We were at the Shangri-La for my husband's birthday...and what a wonderful stay it was! The resort sent three cakes and a huge bouquet and a complimentary bottle of wine. They sure know how to treat their guests! And the facilities are great, especially for kids - the adventure zone, waterplay and pool area could keep them occupied for hours. The house reef is also better than expected, considering it's not natural. If you're looking for sun, sand and the sea and lots of fun, you'll be 100% satisfied. But make no mistake, the prices are five star too, and for the amount charged, it would be good if they could offer free shuttle buses to the city.",Value for money:Food:Staff
We had a great time in this resort. The marine park was awesome with so many fish! The breakfast was good but I wish the mangoes would be sweet. I had to bring this up with the staff as I wasn't expecting this from Cebu! The staff are very friendly and their smiles and hospitality is very much appreciated! Issues when they occur are dealt with swiftly and professionally which is a testament to how this place is run. I definitely would come back.

Not to mention the captivating scenery but as well as helpful and very friendly hotel staffs, I like Myles and Bob who were so accommodating to us. Very efficient securities when my daughter was lost she was spotted by the Bell boy, I forgot his name and turned over by the security at the lobby and there I found her so secured. The adventure zone staffs so quick to respond also.

The rooms we got is deluxe pool view. The rooms were so comfy and enough for the 4 of us ( 2 kids ) but 1 bed is so small for a couple to share. The resort offers a lot of activities every day from adults to children and with age category that makes your stay more memorable and worthwhile.

At the beach, staffs will offer you cold drinks and fish food for fish feeding. Makes our daughter feel so happy feeding them. Housekeeping so efficient as well when we needed something.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"I picked this resort based on Tripadvisor reviews and I was not disappointed. My pre arrival queries were promptly answered and requests arranged. Check in took longer than I had anticipated, but the upgrade to Ocean Wing rooms made up for it. The rooms were big, beds comfortable, and the bathrooms were spacious. The complimentary bottled water and welcome fruit basket was a nice touch.

Our family of 10 was there for 3 days, there was plenty to do for both adults and kids that there was no reason to leave the resort. The kids loved the main pool with the water slide, but we also spent a good amount of time at the pool by the Ocean Wing which had a great view of the ocean! The beach was nice, we enjoyed the fish feeding and the complimentary daily snorkelling safari.

We booked the Family Fun Package so the kids were kept preoccupied at the Kidzone and E-zone. Buffet breakfasts and dinners were included in the package and we had all of our meals at Tides. The was a wide variety of food choices... we were always stuffed!

The first class amenities of this resort are a given. But what struck me was the staff and the excellent service. Everyone always had a smile on their faces... from the staff at the reception desk to the housekeeping staff (who kept the rooms clean and the supply of bottled water well stocked), there was always an aim to please. The lady at the business center was very helpful. The staff at Tides were attentive, several staff even remembered our drink orders from the first dinner that they would ask us if we would like the same drink at succeeding dinners!

I've already recommended this resort to family members, and I look forward to returning to Shangri-la Mactan!",Staff:Food
"It was our first time in the Philippines and we were looking for a quick getaway from our home in Tokyo. After reading up on many different resorts, we settled on the Shangri-La, and had high expectations based on the brand name alone. In short, we were definitely not disappointed.

If you're looking to escape for a few days of relaxation, then this is definitely the place. The grounds are gorgeous and very well-maintained with local flora and lots of picturesque landscaping. We stayed in the older part of the hotel, but I was not disappointed at all by the room. It was large, clean, and very well stocked.

There are several dining options here and we tried them all. Poolside lunch at Acqua was great, dinner down at the Cowrie Cove was beautiful with a great setting. Even room service was really nice and plenty of food.

I can't say enough about the beach area and the marine sanctuary. The fish were everywhere, so many different kinds, and we even went out with one of the guides for a detailed explanation of many of the different kinds of fish. Huge schools of fish were there and it was awesome to swim around with them. Feeding the fish was really cool, too. The beach itself is beautiful, just the right size to never be too crowded, and there was always a chair for us and drinks made to order.

The hotel offers many activities, and although most people never take advantage I'm always the type to jump on some free exercise class or whatever. So one day I did a 5K jog around the resort with a really nice staff member, and he told me all about the place and living on Cebu, etc. The gym itself is really nice too, with anything you might need for a vacation workout.

The spa was absolutely amazing and completely worth a visit, definitely take advantage of showing up early and enjoying the facilities. It's so lusciously landscaped and is really just beautiful.

All in all, this was a great vacation and we really never needed to leave the resort. We took a trip to swim with the whale sharks one day (although cool it's really far away and with traffic can take like 4 hours...but that's a story for another review). So in the end we almost wished we would have just stayed put at the resort. The staff are all extremely friendly and always greeting us, and that made for a truly great experience. This is a top-notch resort and I'd be willing to bet it's the best on Cebu. You won't regret your decision to stay here.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"My family and I spent 3 nights at the Shangri-La. By far, it has been the best kids friendly hotel I've ever been to. My children (8 yrs and 5 yrs ) simply fell in love with the hotel. The food, the staff, and the facility--the hotel has everything you need to make a great family getaway.
We had contemplated on going to see the whalesharks, but the kids didn't want to cutback on their time to play at the adventure zone and E-zone (game center)! The pool is a kid's dream come ture, and the free-fish feeding on Wednesdays at the beach was awesome.
We had the all inclusive ""Family Fun Package"" so we were able to eat at Tides/Aqua for breakfast, and Tides again for dinner. We tried Aqua too, but the kids preferred Tides as the variation of food and the number of staff was far better. Aqua has a more quiet atmosphere and a great view of the ocean, but if you are staying with rowdy kids who are picky eaters--then, Tides is the place to go. My kids fancied the chocolate fountain. The staff at Tides is exceptional--thanks to Joel, Val, Shara, and Lloyd--especially Shara who went out of her way to deliver a take-out coffee to my husband who had left early for the adventure zone with the kids.

The cocktail selections are also limited but you can request for a drink that you would like but still subject to availability and similarity to what is actually available.

We celebrated our 10 year anniversary while at the resort, and although initially overwhelmed by the sheer number of families staying at the resort, we quickly realised it's quite easy to escape them too, and we had a wonderful, romantic, child-free holiday, our days spent by the pool or on the beach, and our evenings spent eating and drinking to our heart's content.

We stayed in the Ocean Wing, and our room was clean, spacious and had sweeping views across the Ocean Pool and the stunning beach. As with all the other reviews, I must say that housekeeping was inconsistent, some days we received our complementary drinking water, other days we did not, and one day house keeping forgot to come entirely and I had to call the service center to rectify this just so we could take a shower with dry towels! That said, the resort was so perfect these minor inconveniences didn't even bother me, we just went back down to the pool again and waited for them to finish cleaning our room, and I just paid for the bottle of Evian from the mini bar on the day we didn't get water. No big deal. The bed is super comfortable, there are seemingly endless tv channels to indulge in, an extensive 24 hour room service menu should you wish to eat in bed, and and as mentioned before, the views took my breath away each and every day. One tiny suggestion, however, would be to get darker curtains. As they were light fabric, the morning sun woke us up each and every day. Not a complete negative, but the opportunity to sleep in required a sleep mask, and for the money we are paying for the room I would expect at least full block out curtains.

Dining is also a wonderful experience at the resort. We didn't feel the need to venture into town for dinner once due to the variety offered on site and the great service- all the staff are friendly and will happily recommend dishes if you are having a hard time choosing. We tried all the restaurants during our stay,they all serve different purposes and are all great. However, the stand out for me was definitely the International Dinner buffet at Tides, not just for the food (which is delicious!) but for the staff who always remembered us. The amazing Eliza greeted us on the second night we dined there BY NAME, and as she walked us to our table recited our drink order from TWO NIGHTS EARLIER and asked us if we wanted the same again. I was blown away, and have never experienced this level of attention to detail anywhere else in the world.

The pools are amazing (and the sport and rec staff are experts at hunting down available Sun Lounges for you- Hana looked after us each afternoon at the Ocean pool and she is so amazing at what she does). The beach is incredible (although the sand is sharper than what I am used to at home, so if you have a pair of reef shoes take them with you, they will come in handy), the water was warm and a deep aquamarine colour that just invited me in every morning. They have created a marine sanctuary full of fish that swim right up to you once you are in the water. You can rent masks and snorkels and snorkel for hours right off the beach. Or just float around in the water enjoying the perfectness of it all. Most other visited stuck to the sand, so most days once we swam out a little distance it was completely private and secluded. We went on a snorkeling tour off another island ran by the dive centre staff, and we had a lovely morning heading out on the boat before snorkeling for an hour in yet another vibrant marine sanctuary. And I can't recommend the Chi spa enough- it's an indulgent retreat where I experienced the best spa treatment of my life (and trust me, I have had a lot of spa treatments). My tip would be go early so you can enjoy the facilities before your treatment.

This resort is top class and worth every cent to stay there. The only down side is the horrible connections to get home to Melbourne. Let's hope we can one day fly direct from Cebu-Mactan to Australia, and then the Shangri-La Mactan can become by annual Holiday destination!!!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"Overall thought the property was rather plain for what it was. I stayed in the Ocean View wing and the rooms were plain, dated, and barren. In short, I've stayed in Marriott Courtyards in Asia with nicer rooms. My biggest issue with the property, however, was the poor service rendered. A few incidents that occurred during my stay:

CHECK-IN: The hotel's check-in time is 2pm. I got there at 1:30pm. Most nice hotels, if you arrive 30 minutes before official check-in time, will allow you to go to your room early; here, however, the room itself was not ready until 2:45pm, almost an hour past my official check-in time. As an attempt to compensate, they offered me late check-out...which I did not need given my flight time. When I told them this; no other comp services were offered.

COWRIE COVE: We went to the Cowrie Cove restaurant for dinner early (at 6pm). We were told that they were booked full and could not accommodate us (party of 2). We asked when the bulk of their reservations were; they answered 7pm. We then told them that if they can seat us now, we'll eat and get out of there by 6:45pm. They grudgingly seated us and lo and behold, by 7:30pm MOST of the tables were still empty.

BEACH SERVICE: It was nearly impossible to find open daybeds at the beach. On top of that, it was almost as difficult to flag down service staff to order food and drinks on the beach. We ended up having to ask the lifeguard to get someone over - it took 20 minutes for someone to come, then another 30 minutes for us to get what we ordered.

I know it was a holiday weekend so the resort was at max capacity but that's no excuse for poor service. Philip at the front desk was the only bright spot amongst a pack of ill-trained staff.",Staff:Food
"We enjoyed our stay here with my family and my brother's family. They have 3 pools you can choose to hang and swim. The beach has white sands although there's also rocks and weeds. Surprisingly, you dont need to go too far to see colorful fishes in the water swimming with you. Their breakfast buffet is the best. Wish I could try everything in one sitting but that's asking a lot from myself. A great hotel to hang out with your family or for couples. Luxury at it's finest in this buzzling city.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I gave a lower rating from my experience last year. This year was different though! We were welcomed by their Guest Relations Officer and their GM the moment we arrived, it was a grand welcome I thought. Then I remembered, my husband recently reached Diamond tier, that's why. Haha Still great welcome experience though.
Same as last year, staff are always nice and friendly, the resort clean and beautiful.
Still needs improvement on house keeping in terms of room make up requests. Also other guests reserving lounge chairs in the morning for hours still annoys me. But,
Over-all it was a great stay and I look forward to going back soon!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Went there with 3 kids. We enjoyed the beach and the pool. Staff are so accomodating. Nice room too. We had problem with the door of the restroom and they fixed it and was very apologetic. Love the food... the place.

This is a great place for kids!

Love love... will definitely go back.

I just hope that if there are guest waiting for a cab they can call cabs outside. We were all lined up and another family but have to wait 30 minutes for cab to arrived. Just outside the hotel
premises there were cans waiting. That's the only complain I have. But overall enjoyed out stay.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This was our fourth time to stay at the Shangri-La Mactan Resort and it has remained consistently excellent over the years. Less than 30 minutes from Cebu airport it offers a great get-away should you only have a few days holiday and don't want to spend it all traveling. In addition to the pool and beach there were plenty of activities ranging from snorkeling to tennis. The protected coral area in front of the hotel offers decent snorkeling in a safe environment. We also enjoyed the mini-golf, tennis, diving and table tennis. Other than the annoying small service charges for using the various facilities and equipment it offers an excellent self-contained vacation for a short stay.",Food:Location
"Coming back from a family holiday where we all left feeling we had a fabulous time and really enjoyed all the resort had to offer. Yes, it would be easy to look at some of the downsides such as dated facilities, problems with over crowding of the hotel (tip - go to the pool / beach early otherwise you will not, and I mean NOT get a lounger), slow slow SLOW service of the food venues and a few other niggles, but I promise you that you will not leave this hotel without good feelings.

From our side the staff made the difference. As a Diamond member we were treated like royalty. Very kind indeed. Little touches made my kids and wife, who don't always get to experience Shangrila like I do, feel so special.

We will be back. And that's a promise.",Staff:Food

"I am not sure if it was my fault to set my expectation of 5-stars hotel toward Shagri La, Mactan, Resort and Spa or it was their services that did not reach a 5-star-hotel standard. Before we traveled there, we emailed their reservation office and it took them longer than other 5-star hotels that we have stayed to respond our queries or requests. So you should email at least a week or two before your checkin date if you have any queries or requests because they do not respond you promptly. Once we got there, there is nothing special for a 350-dollar room. It's just a regular room that you can find anywhere else from 3-5 stars hotels, with a very big bed (two queen beds putting together). Their bar has pretty view, but their cocktails were bad so stick with beer or wine or anything from a bottle. During our stay, the hotel was crowded so it's a bit difficult to find available space at the pools (both of them) or on the beach, except that you go there during hot hours like 1-4pm. In general, the food there was ok (except at the Buko bar, they disappointed us both time we ate there), but pricey. Breakfast choice is various, only that they have the same choices everyday (at least during those 5 days we stayed there). The most disappointing moment was the last day at the hotel when we were waiting for an airport shuttle. The shuttle was late and we had a flight to catch. When we asked a staff who was in charge of transport, she did not want to give us information and started to talk to other staffs in Tagalog, which I personally considered it rude and inconsiderate manner. People can sometime make mistake, but to cover your mistake up and not inform a relating party is unacceptable, especially that relating party was your hotel's guest.

Just to be fair for them, most staffs are really friendly and helpful (thumbs up). The hotel has its own private beach that you can jump in and snorkel. They also have other daily activities that you can join for free.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Convenient location close to airport and okay beach setting, this Shangri la suffers from pretty tiny room and balcony style, and is just too big to deliver on a true luxury atmosphere. Avoid heavy season like xmas, the place is packed and service level is questionable. Prices for food and drinks are skyrocketing, but due to the mass atmosphere is not worth it.
Tennis court is okay, massages outside the hotel is a much smarter deal.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Just came back yesterday. My wife and I took our two boys, 7 and 1, and spent 5 days there. A few thoughts: (1) Room: figuring we'd spend most of our time by the pool/beach, we picked a basic main-wing deluxe room, and were happy with the room. We requested a two-bed room when booking via hotels.com, but were given a king-size one-bed room. We then realized there's a murphy bed by the window, so it works out well (my older boy was excited sleeping on the murphy bed). We also requested a baby crib when booking, but that never came either. (2) Foods: We tried almost all restaurants the resort has to offer, including room service, and overall are pretty happy with the food. However, ordering by the main pool takes forever to deliver (probably 45 mins to 1 hour). There are a lots of people to serve by the main pool and I think the resort is short-staffed there. We got much faster service at the ocean-wing pool by Restaurant Acqua though. (3) Facilities: The pools are very nice, including the toddler pool, kids' water playground, big main pools, and the pool by the ocean wing. There's also a water slide at the main pool, but unfortunately it's only for kids. Also good selection for water/sea activities. The beach is not very big, but enough for the resort I guess. Their Marine Sanctuary is wonderful and my marine-animal-loving son got super excited when I took him snorkeling there. A LOT OF fish right near shore. Highly recommended. (4) Shows: We sat down for the Wednesday night Hawaiian fire dance show (with buffet dinner) and enjoyed it a lot. The performance was very entertaining (my sons loved it!) and went non-stop for about one-hour? Similar shows would cost you US$100-150 in Hawaii but here only about US$50. (5) Internet: The resort has complimentary high-speed WiFi connection everywhere in the resort. A big plus! Conclusion: Though some minor hiccups, overall an enjoyable experience and we think we'll be back. :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"My family with kids went here early summer of March 2016. It was a long drive from our island to reach this place but worth the journey for. It’s occupying a wide area of greenly things and trees that meet the majestic shoreline, and an ample space of parking areas under the trees. With the summer heat already felt along the way, we were been cooled off with the breeze of its wide and good-natured lobby lounge on our arrival. We were warmly welcomed from the entrance by one of their Guest Relation Staff named Mae and she charmingly assisted us right from our arrival till our check-in and until our departure. They offered us refreshing juices while we waited in their lobby during the check-in, and the staff knew what’s best for the kids while waiting – a children’s lounge for cartoon viewing and coloring. Our room is in their Main Wing which is fabulously overlooking the lush gardens and Mactan Island. Inside the room is great with complete amenities and settings of a 5-Star Hotel. The grounds and pools are fantastic and very well maintained with the addition of natured clear beaches and landscapes. The ground staffs were everywhere for a prompt assistance needed and were very polite (with an every time greetings). The kids really love and enjoyed the pool, plus the kiddy zone for an out of water activity. The breakfast buffet was superb with wide array of foods that nobody can eat all of it, hehe. There were 2 Hotel Staff at Tides restaurant, who entertained us well while having breakfast and made our time there delightful, it was Ms. Guia (Hotel Ambassador as she called herself) and Chef Zeny. Almost all of the staff in this hotel are great, because even from the time I was just inquiring up until my booking confirmation they were really helpful in any aspect (to mention are Christine, Katherine, & Flor who attended on my emails), and also staff in the Reception which made our check in/out as smooth as it can (with another refreshing juices also while checking out). Family and kids will really enjoy in this hotel, with the loads of activities it offer, obviously 1 or 2 nights stay is not really enough as what other are also commenting. It’s not only the first impressions that make it last for this hotel but even last impression you’ll experience will definitely say that you’ll love this hotel.

"I recently stayed at the Shangri-la Mactan resort earlier this month and I couldn't have asked for a better place for some rest and relaxation. I enjoyed time at the private beach and I appreciated the very warm and welcoming treatment by the staff at the Ocean Club.

"My family and I have been going to Shangri-la Mactan for almost 10 years. Each year, we book at least 1 holiday here to re-charge. Most of the time we either come during the Holy Week break or the Christmas/ New Year break. My daughters have also developed a familiarity with the place. With the friendly service personnel, I feel confident that my daughters will be safe roaming the grounds whether it be by the garden or beach. The resort property is beg enough to enjoy many activities whether as couples, family with young kids and even family with older kids. My kids enjoyed the water slide by the kiddie pool area and even played with the giant jenga blocks by the garden. The beach is a private beach and very safe with visible and vigilant lifeguards in the property. On this trip, during Good Friday afternoon, a hotel staff came strolling along the pool side offering fruit kebabs to us sunbathers. It felt such a treat.
Holidays in Shangri-La Mactan are always memorable and well-treasured. I cannot imagine a year without coming back here. We always make it a point to come back.",Staff:Location:Food
"LOCATION & PROPERTY: Secluded enough to be away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Cebu yet convenient enough to be only about a 20- to 30-minute drive from the airport. The property is also very expansive; garden is huge and very pretty; interiors nicely done.

ROOMS
- We stayed at the Main Wing. Our room had a balcony and an INCREDIBLE view of the expansive pool area and the sea. Plus it was NEWLY REFURBISHED, and you can tell that only high-quality materials were used (we stayed at Sofitel Manila prior to this stay at Mactan Shang, and the difference in the quality of the interiors was truly noticeable).
- King bed was so big it could comfortably fit 3 adults. Great mattress and comfortable pillows. The turndown service was a nice touch (they left bookmarks on our bed which I highly appreciated as I had been planning to get bookmarks for my vacay reading).
- Bathroom had several hanging hooks (a bit more than the average hotel) which proved to be very useful.
- Also, I can't help but always gush about the newly refurbished hallway: had a very relaxing and homey yet at the same time luxurious ambience to it. The hallway and our room always made it feel so great to be 'back home' at the end of an activity-filled day.

THE BEACH AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
- Manage your expectation of the beach: It's not Boracay with fine, powdery sand. What they have is a MARINE SANCTUARY. Sand is white, yes, and the waters are really very clear. But the sand is quite coarse and quite rocky underwater (there were some plants underwater as well)--but I believe it's because their waters house several species of fish and other marine life. Once you get past that (and wear swim shoes to protect your feet from the sand), you'll surely enjoy SWIMMING WITH THE FISH (lots of fish) and watching them feed off from the rocks underwater. I certainly did.
- The resort also had a full schedule of ACTIVITIES DAILY--most of which were COMPLIMENTARY (e.g., snorkeling safari, water aerobics, zumba at the garden, the list goes on). You'll never run out of things to do at the resort, really. Our family especially enjoyed the morning yoga class at the Chi Spa garden. It really was a special experience: yoga surrounded by nature; knowledgeable, friendly, and patient instructor; lavender and chamomile mist spray at the end; plus it was a first for our family to do yoga together.
- The resort is also a great place for families with kids: a number of areas and play zones devoted to kids and teens. Even the buffet has its own kids' corner.

STAFF
- VERY, VERY FRIENDLY--everywhere we went, from the restaurants to the lobby, the fitness facilities (sauna, yoga class), and the beach area. Even if the resort was a luxury resort, it wouldn't have stood out for us if it wasn't for the genuinely warm and accommodating staff.
- I would especially like to commend NELEUS (assigned at the beach area) who very warmly accommodated our family at the beach. He took the initiative to escort us to our beach chairs, prep our chairs with towels, serve us cold water, and even offered to provide us with a pail of fish food (which we didn't know we could just ask for) which made our experience at the beach even more enjoyable and memorable as we got to feed TONS of fish.
- I'd also like to commend the lady assigned at the ladies' sauna area (around 8PM on March 22); I'm sorry I wasn't able to get her name but she also took the initiative to happily offer and serve lemon-infused water while Mom and I were at the Sauna. Plus the Manager at Tea of Spring who was very warm and cordial all throughout our dinner, and even gladly served jasmine tea on the house when our family asked about one (even if I believe house tea was not usually served at the restaurant).

FOOD
- LOVED the breakfast buffet. A balance of quantity, variety, and quality. We couldn't get enough of the WHEATGRASS SMOOTHIE.
- Also dined at Tea of Spring (Cantonese cuisine) and Acqua (Italian). Tea of Spring was our favorite.

FOR IMPROVEMENT: One strong area for improvement is the Internet connection in the room. It's spotty and not so secure (connecting does not require a password).

TIPS
- Get a room (on the upper floors, 8th or 9th) facing the main pool area and the sea. The rooms at the Main Wing are much closer to the lobby and Chi Spa than those at the Ocean Wing.
- Do not leave the resort unless you really have to. As I said, there are so many things to do at the resort given the daily schedule of complimentary activities that guests can enjoy. Plus there are a number of areas to explore and just enjoy given the expansive property.
- Going to a major mall in the city took us about 90 mins per way (with moderate to heavy traffic); we were told by Guest Services that it would take 45 mins max (the resort offers paid shuttle service to the city's major malls) but no, it did not. We truly regret going and should've just spent more time at the resort. If you really have to go buy something, consider going to SM Savemore instead which is just about a 10- to 15-min drive from the property.
- Be prepared to spend on food. The resort is far away from any other commercial establishment, and when it comes to dining, your choices are limited to the restaurants at the resort (I think there are about 5)--they serve great food yes, but the prices are of course higher than average.

IN GENERAL

"This was a lovely resort enclave with a very nice private beach, perfect for a few days’ getaway. It is almost a 5-star property, but a bit worn around the edges if you look closely.

An easy shuttle ride from the airport, included in our room price as we booked the Ocean wing, which I recommend (we didn’t choose the Club floors, as we didn’t need the lounge access). The Ocean wing is connected to the main building with its grand open-air lobby that reminded us of Hawaii resort hotels, but is the end closest to the beach and has its own small check-in lobby. Our Panorama room had a fabulous oceanfront view; the room itself was nice enough, though more ordinary than other Shangri-La properties we visited. No filtration system here, so we used the bottled water provided. Free wi-fi worked well. We enjoyed the proximity to the beach, the beachside pool (smaller than the huge main pool, but a nicer setting), and Aqua restaurant which provided a calmer atmosphere for breakfast. Tides, the main restaurant, has a more extensive buffet for breakfast, but is more crowded and the day we ate there, they ran out of orange juice in the middle of breakfast, which was surprising.

We never left the property during our 3-night stay; aside from the beach and pool (with F&B service available at both), we enjoyed snorkeling (the beachfront area is a marine preserve), a half-hour sail, the 6-hole golf park and mini-golf. There’s an onsite ice cream shop, but they no longer offer the sundae creations on the menu, just scoops. Food was a bit inconsistent – the filet steak was not good quality, lamb was better. Agnolotti in pesto cream sauce was outrageously delicious! One of the nicest experiences was the private dinner in a gazebo overlooking the beach – book ahead, because there are only two spots and they fill up.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I used to think that this resort have a 5 star service. In fact, I used to even send my parents or family to go there for special occasions. We even rented their Paradise island for an intimate Valentines dinner, once. So we thought, that maybe this place would be less stressful to have a destination wedding. But boy, we we're so wrong. From the person who handles our wedding down to the Director of Marketing(Albert LaFuente) was just unbelievably unprofessional. I lost all respect for that place. And because of lack of attention and the extreme rudeness of Albert Lafuente. We decided to cancel our wedding-3 months before the wedding date. Thank God, that I still have some friends in that industry who have helped me find a place to our wedding. I have to redo the invitations and inform all the guest not just from Cebu but also from the guest who came from California, Oregon, Texas, London, Singapore and Brunei. What a pain that was! I wouldn't trust this place for a destination wedding. As far, as the food they are mediocre at it's best. And we've been to a few Michelin stars restaurant in the US and Europe. Although, as far as pricing for weddings, they are a lot cheaper compared to other resorts. As far as service for a 5 star hotel they are not at par with the Ritz Carlton in Half moon Bay or Waldorf Astoria in New York. Which we have stayed in the past. Even the Pangulasian and Miniloc Resort hotels are way better in service than them. So, if you plan to have a wedding here. You have to do your research and get a wedding planner.

Our son (age 7) loved the Kid's Club and spent at least 2-hours every day playing. The pool was super relaxing and we never had a problem finding seats. The pool staff was wonderful and always nearby to order food or drinks. The restaurants are lovely - we were never wanting for delicious food!

However - the not so good, excess noise at night from the bar (woke me three times on the 8th floor), poor front desk staff who do not address any concerns and breakfast times that are a cross between a rugby scrum and feeding time at the zoo.
Very poor customer recovery service (words not actions) and it seems the staff (and certainly the management) have no real concept of why people come to the Shangri-La.All in all - Ok but not 5 star, not worth the money and certainly won't be coming back (I am a Shangi-La Golden Circle member and regularly visit their chain).",Staff:Food:Value for money

"I've stayed in several Shangrila this year. First time to this one in Mactan. Have been told that it's a popular resort in cebu. Let's list some good and bad.

Good
- room is of the usual Shangrila standard. No surprise.
- facilities are excellent. Kids are gonna love this place. I came on a biz trip so didn't get to enjoy much
- a very serene and peaceful place. Excellent for relaxation
- there are 2 places for breakfast. I prefer Acqua at the ocean wing. The view is a lot nicer and quieter. However food is a simplified version of the other place.
- had dinner at the Chinese restaurant. Very yummy. Love the food, ambience and service. It's costly.
- near the airport

- didn't really feel the impressive service that I normally feel in Shangrila elsewhere especially in makati/Manila.
- wrote to them a few days before check in requested for king size bed but was brought into a room with twin bed for check in. She sounded like she didn't know and the usual ""subject to availability"" nonsense came up. She however immediately requested ppl to join the beds.
- the shower/bathtub will have water flown out n wet the floor although curtain is closed. Lousy design.
- NO OUTSIDE FOOD allowed. There's a corkage charge of PhP 3000 for bringing outside food into the resort. Ridiculous!
- this resort is nowhere near anything. No malls. No nearby walking distance food other than those in the resort. It takes an hour to reach the city center. Traffic is always bad.
- north worth the price",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

staff outside friendly. lovely food at outside bars..beach snack bar really good.
seemed really well catered for families, pools, snorkeling golf.
excellent meal in the a la cart but my friend was disappointed with the buffet.service isnt great.
rooms were average, tired, could have done with an update. disappointed really. it is not a cheap place to stay!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
Our stay was not 5 star and what we have come to expect from Shangri-la. The hotel needs updating. It took 5 days before someone from mangement to call us with a problem. It seems like they just don't care. The grounds are nice and the properties do have lots to do. The chi spa was the best part of our stay but not enough for us to return.,Staff:Location
"We went on a family weekend trip to this beautiful resort. The location is absolutely stunning. The gardens and the landscape is beautiful. The restaurants and bars have courteous and friendly service. The wave bar has great drinks and fabulous live music and very friendly staff.
Unfortunately the rooms aren't that great for the Shangrila brand. We expected better. We know the property isn't new but one would expect the dishes, cutlery, trays etc to be at least presentable.. I was shocked at the quality of the food covers when my kids ordered room service.
Anyway, overall a nice place and it could be better only if they looked into these little details and kept it up to a five star luxury level. After all it isn't a cheap place!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

We enjoyed our room, the beach and the views! (I didnt try out the pool cause I prefer the beach!) Our room was situated in the Ocean Wing side, which is lobg walk from the lobby and the main resto, Tides for breakfast.

There were several boutique shops within the hotel, in case you forgot to bring your swimming outfits and other gears.

Breakfast was good, there were several options and they were quick to refill. During peak meal hours, the resto can get easily full and we were asked to wait for sometime.

The best part is they have Marine sanctuary and fishes were abundant",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

My kids had a great time at the pool and the beach (you can swim and feed the fish ). You can rent snorkeling gear if you forgot to bring one. There are a lot of water sports you can do, just ask the booth near the beach.

"Shangri-La has always been our quick getaway hotel in Cebu. However during our last stay which happened to be our anniversary treat (2015) we didn't have a very good experience. To the resort's credit we were promised a complimentary next-room category upgrade on our next stay. Fast forward to this year and we were celebrating our anniversary again, we decided to book and avail of the upgrade.

We originally booked their Ocean Wing Premier room so an upgrade to their Panorama room was expected. Imagine our surprise when we were shown to a corner suite! It was totally unexpected! There was wine and cake (not just a slice but a whole cake!) On the bed and bath tub were scattered rose petals. Very romantic! We were truly impressed how the resort tried to make amends for our unfortunate stay last time. And I must say they really made it up big time! This is just one of the many reasons why we keep coming back to Shangri-La.",Value for money:Staff:Food
"Stayed at this top quality hotel for a business event...so hard to evaluate 'value for money', but this is not a hotel for budget travellers. It is like something you see on TV with manicured gardens, super pools, fabulous par three golf course on site, lovely spa area, and great beach layout.
Many amenities
Well appointed clean rooms
Lovely welcome from Veronica when checking in plus complimentary juice
Great piano music from Antonio in the lobby near the bar....
The bar was attended by some lovely ladies Angel, Esther, Grace, and the delightful and very efficient Sarah Zeke who made every visit special.
Is it just a national trait in the Philippines to be smiling and helpful or is it the Shangri La training?
Whatever....it worked for me and the team are to be congratulated.

"From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with warm and friendly greetings, our check-in was speedy and we were on our way to a complimentary upgraded corner suite which had an ocean view and pool view. The suite was enormous and the bed was so comfortable. The next morning we had the best breakfast out of any resort we've ever stayed at, they have everything and anything you desire. I've never been at a hotel that serves mounds of fresh sliced mangos, and no one has better mangos then Cebu, Philippines. After breakfast we hung out by the pool, then we had dim sum for lunch in the Chinese restaurant. The next day we relaxed on the beach and had a seafood platter which again was absolutely delicious.

"I had a splendid stay here at Shangri-La Mactan because of the numerous activities that you can do here. Their beach was great for snorkeling and they offered it as a free activity at 1pm on some days so do check it out. Such a great variety of fishes and corals. And of course there's the giant clam! There are tons of stuff actually so you better check them out when you stay here. Service was also great and they even kept the items I left in my hotel room and gave it to my friend who was flying back to Manila so thank you Shangri-La staff! Their Tides breakfast was good and their dinner was awesome because it was the first time I've ever seen a lechon being paraded around a restaurant complete with music and all. That cracked me up and really brought a festive mood inside the restaurant. The staff also greeted you good morning every where you go but it didn't have the ""personal"" feel that I had in Cambodia so I couldn't give it a 5 star. We also checked in at 5am and unfortunately no rooms were available yet so had to loiter the hotel a bit and slept at the lobby! It was safe though! :) We got a room in the old wing and it smelled quite a bit old and probably needed an upgrade but it was a good room nonetheless.

Would stay here again! :)",Food:Staff

The many restaurants on the resort will make it very easy to not have to leave the resort for food. The two breakfast buffets are out of this world (in fairness I only went to one, but I can imagine the other one).

The panorama view room was nice, well equipped, and had a wonderful view and a balcony overlooking the pool and beach..
The grounds and beach are so extensive that even though the hotel was busy, it did not seem crowded.
The ocean Wing had its own pool which was nice and you could have breakfast in the ""Aqua"" restaurant at pool level, which was quieter and more convenient than the main hotel ""Tides"" restaurant.
There was a great choice of places to eat. We loved Acqua, the Italian restaurant, and Cowrie Cove seafood restaurant, perched right at the sea's edge. The evening buffet at ""Tides"" was excellent in quality, variety and value.
There were plenty of well organised water sports to choose from and you could swim among the fish in the hotel's marine sanctuary, which the children loved.

Shangrila Mactan is a great place of you would want to spend quality time with the family. Stayed there for 4D3N for a wedding. We didn't have to leave the place to have fun. There's a beach and pools for different ages. My toddlers enjoyed the pool that was safe for them. And there were places for the kids for their excess energy. They particularly liked fish feeding and just playing by the sand. Breakfast buffet was superb and they had a gluten free zone. The chef was very accommodating with my son's special diet (GFCFSF) and they served his food wherever we would have our meals.

"Spend three nights at this property on a two week trip through the Philippines and of all of the properties this was the most disappointing. There is an automatic 10% service charge on every single bill issued on the hotel property and honestly the staff are not deserving of this at all. In addition all drinks are 400 pesos (US$9.50 each) so you feel like the hotel is just price gouging for everything.

1. We wrote up postcards and bought the stamps for the postage and asked the front desk clerk, Jerovic, if the hotel could put them in the mail for us. She said to go to the business center which we did but was unstaffed. We returned to the front desk then she informed us there would be a charge to ""take the cards to the post office"". We pressed her and she called for verification then finally agreed to mail the cards for us. If a 10% service charge is on every bill this should not even have been a discussion with the front desk.

2. At the dinner on their beachside restaurant that was only half full on a Weds night it tool a full 50 minutes to get three fish filets (all of which were overcooked and dry) and then we had to get up ask the server to bring us the bill after waiting to no end.

3. Lobby bar last Thursday night we were the only people there and we were served our cocktails then sat there for 30 minutes waiting for the bartender/server to come and check on us. She was standing behind the bar talking to another employee for the entire time so I had to walk up there and explain we'd been waiting so long for the bill. If I could have removed the 10% service fee I would have since we received no service.

Hotel property is nice enough. Beach is actually coral sand so hard on the feet but the coral garden has tons of fish. If you have absolutely no other place to stay on Mactan this could pass. There's a Movenpick Hotel just next door as well.",Staff:Value for money:Food
"Staying at Shangri-La's Mactan Resort and Spa never fails to impress. Service is at it's best and staff are genuinely nice. Pool and Beach are maintained well. However, rooms needs to be checked and inspected for broken fixtures as these could pose hazards when traveling especially with children in tow.

"Shangri-La Mactan Resort is one of the best 5-star family beach resorts in Asia! First it’s a Shangri-La, and for the most part, what you come to love about staying at a Shangri-La exists here as well: it's well-managed w/beautifully designed facilities. But what makes this Shangri-La so special is the staff, who were not only super nice, but smart and proactive. From Rodel (sp?) on the beach (who always finds you a great spot even if you come down at 11am and need 5 lounge chairs under an umbrella) to the egg station cook at breakfast, everyone is happy, alert, and attentive to your needs. We were there over Xmas and naturally the resort was crowded. So it would have been very easy for staff to get over-whelmed, and perhaps a bit grouchy. But this never happened. Throughout the hotel, the staff gave us really exceptional service!! Secondly the resort is well laid out. An idyllic white sandy beach is just down a short flight of stairs. The beach is big enough to fit everyone but not feel crowded. Also, there is great snorkeling right in front of the hotel. There were so many varieties of tropical fish I stopped counting (bring your Go-Pro and take video underwater swimming w/the fish). And there is an activity center on the beach that can rent you a sail boat, snorkel/fins, arrange island hoping, parasailing, jet skiing, and so much more. And the hotel has 2 nice pools!! Also excellent free wifi throughout, even on the beach. For food and drink, there are plenty of eateries smartly placed throughout the resort, including ones by the beach, and next to both pools. Speaking of food, breakfast is exceptional (also another trademark of Shangri-La hotels). Another benefit is the hotel's proximity to the rest of Asia. Cebu is within 3 hours by plane from most big cities in Asia. Airport to hotel transfer is under 30 minutes. So for family with young children, convenient access is a big advantage. Overall I highly recommend this resort. Great job Shangri-La Mactan!!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Our family of three stayed in the resort from 27th November 2015 to 2nd December 2015. The initial part of the stay was complicated by a drainage problem in the toilet, resulting in a change of room. However, this was well handled by Mr Rene Egle from the resort and was greatly appreciated by my wife, daughter and myself.

The rest of stay was great! We had a suite in the ocean wing with a magnificent view of the ocean. Size wise - the suite was huge for the three of us. Room facilities wise - there were 2 TVs and 2 DVD players, the bar refrigerator was kind of small and was not functioning properly - but we did not report the problem.

Resort facilities: My 4 year old daughter loved the swimming activities in the resort -she just could not get enough of it and is still asking to go back to the resort soon. There were adequate life-guards patrolling the pools and the equipment (life jackets, boards, floats) were all in good condition.

Service quality throughout the resort was that of the highest standards - staff were always polite and smiling. This includes staff from the security / lobby / concierge / reception / restaurants / club floor / beach / swimming pool / shuttle bus drivers (I hope I didn't miss anyone). It demonstrates that staff were generally well motivated and were taking their work seriously and with pride.

Beach: The resort has a beautiful private white sandy beach. The water was clean and had many beautiful small fishes in it. We rent a kayak for a short duration. My advice - put on lots of suntan lotion - the sun is really unforgiving. They also provided fish feed which really got my little girl excited - she loves feeding the fishes.

Food: The breakfast was international cruisine - it can get a bit boring especially if you are there for a long stay. We dining at the pool side restaurant - had the lechon which was good. Expect to pay more than the local price since you are at a 5 star resort. We did venture out of the resort and had other great food as well - lechon manuk (roasted chicken), lechon baboy (roasted pork), liempo (roasted pork ribs) etc.

Sidetrack a little: There is a decent lechon shop just opposite the departing international airport which we managed to get some food back for my filipino maids back home too :).

Overall, it was a great holiday for myself and my family. The establishment should deserve a 5 star rating - However, I deducted a star off for initial handling of the toilet mishap.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"In summary this place is a fantastic resort, with lovely rooms, great food in the buffet restaurant (Tides) and the Italian (Acqua), very friendly and helpful staff and a small idyllic private beach with coral garden. But everyone says this, so I really want to use this review to give you a little bit of advice:
1. Everything on the hotel is extremely expensive. Even by international hotel chain standards. Therefore, I would make sure you book a package (the family fun package is good even if you don't use the family elements). Aim to get half board and drinks with your evening meal in the package. If the package doesn't appear on the booking page, adjust the length of your stay and then email them after booking to change :)
2. We had the choice of breakfast in Tides and Acqua. Acqua is a much smaller, more intimate and generally a nicer place to eat. BUT, for breakfast they don't have the same turn over of food as Tides, so its not as fresh and the selection is smaller.
3. Book a table for evening meal in Tides and eat early. During our stay, the hotel became progressively busier with what appeared to be Chinese package holidaymakers. I did notice that a number of the newer guests were rude to staff and it also bacame harder to get a table at dinner time. This said, it is worth pointing out that the grounds (specially the beach) never felt busy.
4. If you have children who plan on using the softplay, make sure you take a long sleeve top and socks, otherwise they're not allowed in. We ended up buying a cheap top in a local mall.
5. If you do the mall visit, Ayala Centre is nicer than S&M.

Finally ENJOY! Both the Philippines and the Shangri-La Mactan are great.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"The place sits on a huge property offering various activities that could really keep any age level engaged however a false alarm situation was a big, big downer.

Here's what happened: Before 5am we were woken up by the PA (Public Address) system asking everyone to evacuate due to an emergency situation. Heeding the announcement, along with other guests who were mostly groggy with sleep we piled out to the hall heading for the exits. On the way out, a lady came out of her room; seeing my mother on the wheelchair ( she is 85 years old) she told us it was a false alarm and that we should call the front desk. We did find out it was indeed a false alarm (later was told that someone inadvertently triggered the alarm) and a few minutes later we heard a new PA announcement in a language I am not familiar with but would guess it to be Chinese. It left me wondering if the information I got by phone was consistent with the new announcement. A good few minutes later, the english announcement came on.

The next day, I spoke with the staff relaying my sentiments that had it been a real emergency, the first language to be used should be English as it is the recognized international language followed right after by other translations. But really, it was no fun scurrying out with an elderly Mom, and it could have been worse considering her age and mobility.

In response, I got note from the Manager and two sachets of candied fruits. Not classy considering this is Shangrila but my sister were only too happy it was no real emergency. Despite the note, I have already decided to include this in my review as I told Mae, the gracious Guest Relations Officer who I spoke with saying I owe it to contributors of TripAdvisor that is considering I rely on their reviews and feedback to make travel decisions, so this is my way of returning the favor - my own review.

Hopefully, Shangrila Mactan would be able to avoid such incidents in the future and handle it better by using the appropriate languages and readily provide translations right after in making PA announcements.",Staff

"This property gets amazing reviews but I had an underwhelming experience. The hotel does not really scream ""5 star"". if you get a good room, the view of the sea can be quite good. However, the rooms are small and old. They need an upgrade. It was also disappointing that we got a ""fake"" king bed, i.e., two twin beds put together to pass off as a king bed. It's a 5 star resort, they should do better. In my parents' room, there was a leak on the floor when they took a shower.

I was also very annoyed at how one of the staff handled our request for a golf cart to pick up my dad from the beach area and bring him back to the hotel. They said none was available and they couldn't say when one would become available. They told us to just hike slowly back to the room. I explained that my dad was suffering from gout and could not physically walk back to the room without excruciating pain. So they checked again but said there really wasn't any way for them to confirm when the cart would be picking up my dad because ""they prioritized guests who were checking in and checking out"".

Annoyed, I told her that she shouldn't have said that because it doesn't make sense that we, the current guests, would be passed over for guests who were yet to check in or guests who were already leaving. After further following-up with the staff at the front desk, they finally sent a cart to pick up my dad.

Wifi wasn't that great, too.

On the plus side, the resort is big with lots of activities for everyone and snorkeling right at the beach. The breakfast was aso quite good with various choices. However, I wouldn't stay here again for the hefty price as the rooms don't really measure up to it.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We booked a suite to accommodate our family (2 adults, 3 kids ages 12, 10 and 6). Cost was ~$675US/night in an Ocean Wing Suite (with panoramic view of the Ocean) and with Ocean Club privileges. This included breakfast buffet each morning, unlimited snorkeling with their gear, unlimited kayaking, 2 hours for our kids in the Adventure Zone and all day drinks and 5p - 7p happy hour in the lounge.

Breakfast could be taken in the Ocean Club Lounge, the restaurant in the ground floor of the Ocean Wing (Aqua) or the Tides buffet in the main hotel building. We heard from friends who arrived before we did that Tides was VERY busy so we took breakfast in Aqua each day. I checked out the breakfast in the lounge, and it had a good selection in a quieter atmosphere, but considering we were meeting friends, our group of 9 at one time was better served in Aqua, where we could take tables outside and enjoy the warm morning breezes. Breakfast was an extensive offering of western options with some Asian options. Other than an awkward corner where you would try to get bacon, sausage and potatoes as others lined up for their omelettes, it would be hard to find fault with the breakfast - very well done.

The grounds are large with offerings for people of all ages and interests. 2 pools, a kids water play area, miniature golf, 6 holes of pitch and putt golf, badminton, over-sized Jenga and billiards and table tennis all right in the middle of the resort - in addition to their beach (which I'll cover later). In 4 days we couldn't get to all the options. Some are free, and some incur additional cost. Free: billiards, Jenga, badminton, table tennis. Cost: Mini-golf, Pitch and Putt Golf.

The beach is a wonderful treat. They do a great job keeping it clean and organized and helping people find seats for their family. I'll have a comment shortly about seating. The beach provides access to a marine sanctuary that is buoyed off for safe access to snorkeling. It is a very large area and there are hundreds of different types of fish to see. While I am sure they are trying to support healthy ecosystem development, the reality is that the coral will likely struggle to grow naturally with so many people walking on the ground instead of swimming over the ground in the 'sanctuary' and it's clear the fish are incredibly tame as they are used to the feeding program and the tourists. For me this was not an issue. I wanted to see lots of pretty fish and I did - kind of like swimming in a huge aquarium - very cool.

The beach also provides access to many of the motorized activities you see all over beaches in Asia (which bug me, but not others as there's a demand for the activities). You can jet ski, take ride on an inflatable banana behind a motor boat and para sail behind a motor boat. These, gladly, do not interfere with the snorkeling.

Seating is a challenge. People go out to the pools and beach early to 'reserve' (put towels out or personal items) chairs. This means that sometimes it can be very hard to find seating in the areas in which your kids are playing. Sometimes it's simply hard to find seating at all. That being said, the staff works very hard to find seats, sometimes brokering with families to use chairs only for adults to let other adults use them since mostly children will be off playing.

This brings me to the staff. Between the baseline friendliness of the Filipino people and the training by the Shangri-la managment, the staff is WONDERFUL. Everyone is pleasant, has a smile, is friendly and seems to go out of the way to make your stay wonderful. They are really the highlight of the resort.

The Ocean Club Lounge is nice, but gets VERY busy during happy hour when there are complimentary drinks and appetizers. Appetizers are slow to come out during peak times and the stock of alcohol sometimes results in some items, when consumed being replaced with other items - not replaced (for example, they ran out of Jack Daniels and replaced it with Jim Beam - not a huge deal, but at nearly $700/night and combined with the slow pace of appetizers being restocked was a little annoying). Another situation where at peak times seating was a challenge, the staff - always looking to make your stay wonderful - worked hard to find new seats, make seating efficient and accommodate our group. Given resort pricing, it was nice to have a couple 'free' (rather 'included' or 'prepaid') drinks before heading to dinner.

From a food perspective, outside of breakfast at Aqua we tried the Baku Bar, which was a little spendy, but not atrocious. Burgers and like items were good. The whole grilled chicken (roasting on a spit outside the bar) for 550 pesos was a great deal and fed 4 adults easily. We ordered 3 cheese pizzas for lunch one day for the kids (pizza was good) for ~$28USD (1400 pesos), which was not bad - fed 5 kids and 2 dads in combination with some self purchased snacks from local convenience store and fruit from Ocean Club Lounge and what was provided in the room by the cleaning service. We did the Filipino buffet and cultural show one night - by far our worst decision. The cost was incredibly high, the food was not very good and the show was a little kitschy... though the kids seemed to enjoy it and the cast was very accommodating for pictures afterward. We ventured off property for dinner at AA BBQ (see other review) on another night and the local Filipino BBQ at 1/10th the price was so much better food than the buffet.

Our room was GREAT sized. They had a King bed in the master bedroom for my wife and I, a pull out for our 2 older girls and a roll away bed for our youngest. And the suite did not feel over crowded. The King bed is in fact a combination of 2 doubles so it was large enough that one night we had 4 girls between the ages of 13 and 10 do a sleep over in that bed. The room has all the amenities you would expect at the price point we paid. The hotel is getting a little dated. Floors are scratched and scuffed, carpets starting to show wear. Some bubbling of wall paper and wall board from water damage at some point in the past. All relatively minor - but again, when you are in the $700/night range, you'd expect a little more attention to physical detail.

I think we'd strongly consider staying here again - perhaps for a long weekend - due primarily to the beach/snorkeling, the large pools and the friendly staff.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"An absolutely beautiful resort, people have been extremely helpful and accommodating. Breakfast buffet is great and the restaurants have been good, if not a bit slow on service.

"Shangri-la Mactan...a ""Paradise in Cebu"". This has been our third year to spend Christmas holidays in this resort and it has never failed to amaze us. Aside from the excellent service, this hotel resort has so much to offer it's guests with activities of their choice. For those who love the beach, a lot of action such as watersports (motorized/non-motorized), snorkelling, feeding the fish from your hand will keep the highly active from getting bored. For those who want to relax, one can go to CHI SPA and have themselves pampered amidst the beautiful structures and landscape.

It would be an injustice not to mention several names who have made our stay as comfortable as it can ever be. This year, we we're booked at the Ocean Wing. The staff at the exclusive Ocean Club Lounge extended impeccable service. NO REQUESTS (reasonable, of course) were ever denied us. Please don't get me wrong, all the staff of the resort have the most sincere smiles in greeting it's guests. Even the staff at the Tides made sure that a wheelchair was on hand at all times for my friend.

At the Club Lounge, Marie, Tria, John and Catherine to name a few, were always there to make sure that all our needs were attended to...and these were never ""hurriedly"" done. It seemed that they naturally enjoy talking with guests without being intrusive. Even with the housekeeping team, ""Rigo"" made sure that our room was fixed up as soon as we returned after breakfast from the Club Lounge.

I have to make special mention to Ms. Ria of the reservations office for arranging ALL our requests days before our arrival, including restaurant reservations.

I believe all these were through the efforts of it's GM and by Mr. Terence Perez of the Ocean Wing, who I heard had been with the resort from it's conception.

To all of you at Shangri-la Mactan, THANK YOU VERY MUCH and looking forward to seeing all of you again next Christmas!",Staff:Food
"... but probably not the best time to experience it, over Christmas, pretty much full to capacity with some 1500 guests. Knowing Shangri-La hotels from China, I guess we have become accustomed to a very high level of service and facilities, to which this one did not quite measure up. Some of the touches were there: a very attentive, helpful, pleasant front desk lady, an knowledgeable IT technician sorting out internet access problems, a shuttle-bus driver going way beyond the call of duty. The room and some of the public areas are looking a bit tired and worn and dining facilities were struggling to cope. In fairness, it has to be said that they struggled with grace and smiles! So our ""average"" rating is perhaps a bit harsh, but ""very good"" would have been too much.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Internet
"Pros:

1. Hotel layout and surrounding are very nice; it is perfect for family vacations seeking different resort activities.

2. The staff are very helpful, attentive, and will try to meet your requests. I remember booking for a Tuesday Garden Tour but it was cancelled as the gardener guide wasn't available that day. Instead, they specially booked me for the next day even though there wasn't a scheduled Garden Tour the next day.

3. The Chi Spa is definitely worth a visit. The landscaping and surroundings of the spa are very beautiful and it is peaceful inside for those looking to retreat from all the noise. The Chi Spa staff are also very helpful and attentive to details.

4. Snorkeling safari activity a must try; the tour guide is competent and engaging. It is an experience to have a beach so close that is teeming with different marine life.

5. Food at Acqua and the Ocean Club Lounge are very good!

Cons:

1. I encountered at the Ocean Club Lounge an expired yogurt (2 days) and jam (1 month). What concerns me is the yogurt because oftentimes yogurt is served in a big bowl wherein you just spoon some into your own bowl. Chances are, expired yogurt may be mixed if not careful. In this instance, the yogurt was still in a packaged container so I just opened it and left it at our table.

2. The L'Occitane conditioner provided as bathroom amenity was really bad. This is not what we expect from a brand like L'Occitane.

3. Our Ocean Club Room had broken door swing, doorbell, and bathroom ventilation. Initially the door swing and doorbell were fine but broke down the next day for unknown reasons.

4. When we booked a month ago, we requested for orthopedic pillows. When we arrived they informed that our room already has our request. However we didn't find it and when we upgraded to the Ocean Club room we still had to follow up on the pillows only to be informed that the hotel doesn't have orthopedic pillows (only foam ones).

Overall the experience was great, but it could have been better. I would still recommend this hotel.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"My hubby decided to spend our honeymoon in Shang-ri La Mactan because he said he would like me to experience it like he did too. It was 2nd of my hubby and first for me. Well, the lobby was just so so, but it,s nice because they provide big couch chairs that are comfy, plus there were receptionist that can attend to the needs of their guests be it Japanese, Korean etc. They were presentable too. But after going to our room, I was in awe of the beautiful view. We stayed at the ocean wing of the hotel. The view was so breathtaking seeing the beautiful beach and gigantic pools. It was so refreshing Choz there were a lot of trees. Very natural. I think the only downside of the room assigned to us was there were lightbulbs defective and the bathtub was too small. Otherwise their housekeeping department was very attentive to their guests. Thanks also fir giving us complimentary wine and snacks. It was a very touching gesture which me and my hubby loved about Shangrila Mactan. They really made our honeymoon so special and unforgettable. We would definitely go back for our anniversary!

For us it was a trip to remember indeed.",Staff:Food:Location
"First of all, I have to say that I was disappointed with my room, which needs renovation, just as the stained carpets in the hallway need to be replaced. For a 5-star hotel, the rooms are already showing their age. For a resort hotel, their beds need to be more comfortable. Instead, they were too firm for comfort and the pillows were shabby -- they fell flat as soon as you'd lay your head on them. They used king-sized pillow cases on standard size pillows and the pillows had mold stains! As if it wasn't bad enough that they joined together two beds to create a king-sized one -- and I made this booking more than a month ahead -- they also used two insufficiently-sized duvets to cover it. You'd think this hotel is falling on hard times when in fact there were a lot of people during the time that I stayed.

That aside, once you step into the grounds and into the main lobby, you'd forget your gripes and be mesmerized. Everything was lovely and it was like they did not leave any stone unturned. The star attraction was the house marine sanctuary, which teemed with fishes and corals and was better than the snorkelling sites I've been to in both the northern and southernmost tips of Cebu, from Malapascua and Bantayan to Oslob. The watersports facilities were reasonably-priced and the waterpark was a lot of fun too.

Besides that, all the hotel staff were polite and attentive.

All told, I did enjoy my stay despite myself and would return.",Comfort & Facilities
"Shangrila Mactan on its own satisfies the needs of the family.

Good food with variety
A private beach to lounge and play
And other shangrila amenities like the kid zone

But the location of Shangrila in Cebu is what makes it truly special. Aside from the exceptional resort experience, Mactan has so much to offer. We did a day tour to neighboring islands with my one year old.

The beauty of these islands were the home run for this family vacation. I would definitely recommend Shangrila for a family seeking a small adventure.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities

Our room gave us access to the Ocean Wing Club lounge, however during our stay for both the breakfast and evening cocktail hour the lounge was filled to capacity with young families. As our stay was based on a relaxed vacation time, this deflect a little from enjoyment of the hotel facilities.
This is obviously a popular family hotel, so I would not recommend for couples who are looking for a more calm environment.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"We are fans of Shangrila chain of hotels but are greatly dissapointed this trip to mactan. It's our 2nd trip back there and sad to say will be our last.
Hotel rooms were clean and amenities of excellent quality. Lovely hotel. Great food.
Our tap was spoiled and our aircons switches on and off - we don't know of its a problem but we left it as the rooms were kept cool.
Queues for breakfast were minimum 30 to 45 mins during peak hours of 8 to 9am. The restaurant was overflowing thus we had to move to the Chinese restaurant which is really inconvient. At the beach, it was so full we had to take a spot at the far end and sadly no staff to attend to us. We waited 45 mins to have orders taken then 30 mins for cold food to arrive. It's understaffed so scored poorly with me on efficiency during high
volume periods.

Not much adult entertainment at night! I wouldn't say it's worth the money!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"The property itself is excellent, with nicely appointed rooms and a small but pretty beach cove. However this is no different from a typical tropical vacation resort, with all the services & amenities - and more add-ons, service charges & hidden fees than you'd expect. This is no Banyan or 4 Seasons, Shangri-La presents itself as a high end resort but operates like a cut-rate one. Americans visiting will find themselves disappointed and wondering why they didn't save the mileage and go to Hawaii instead.

The hotel management booked us a King bed room, and then pawned a twin bed on us for the first night. The room also hadn't been properly cleaned and gave both my wife and I an allergy attack. It took them almost 2 hours to move us, and promised us ""5 minutes"" over the course of multiple calls when the staff didn't show. The buffet is very good, but also the most expensive I've ever had. The check-in and check-out process was long and tedious despite a short line, the staff were clueless and unresponsive, and the quality of the food at the other restaurants was disappointing. The resort even has the gall to charge $15US for mini golf, which is likely why we never saw anyone using it the entire time we were there. The shuttle is also overpriced and a taxi will be more convenient - use Grabtaxi to get places if you're stuck here.

The city of Cebu itself is a much better place to stay - I rented a modern 2 bedroom condo for about $100USD per night in Ayala and really liked the experience I had. The city is vibrant and full of great restaurants and bars, all of which are extremely inexpensive for Americans.",Staff:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

"Our experience at the Shang has generally been great in the many times we stayed with them over the years. The Ocean Club rooms provided the best value, with a more exclusive wing nearer to the beach, waterfront views from your room, and access to a great exclusive lounge that serves breakfast and early evening cocktails. However, F&B has been the constant fly in the ointment. Over the last 10 years, our lunch or dinner experiences at Tides have always been really poor. Selections are limited, and quality of food is not that great. We went to Tides for lunch on a Sunday (Nov 22). Big mistake! Tides pales in comparison to Heat and Circles in Manila that really live up to the Shang brand. Our lunch last Sunday was really bad. I think price was about P2,000, but we could only eat some sushi and some lechon and rice. All the other choices featuring some Korean, Indian and noodle dishes were really forgetable. The fruit section did not even have mangoes that Cebu is famous for! It felt like a real rip-off. I would recommend avoiding Tides for lunch and dinner until they improve dramatically. The dinner during our event function was even more of a disaster. The mushroom soup with truffle oil was concededly good, but the appetizer crab cake was not crisp, and the tenderloin beef was tough as a rock! It was a real chore cutting it with your steak knife. Everyone in the function was served super dry and super overcooked, tough tenderloin. With other cuts of beef one can understand, but botching up tenderloin, and by a Shang chef? Come on! When we gave feedback to the chef through our waiter, he returned a few minutes later to tell us that the chef said it is the same with all the others (pareho naman sa lahat), which added insult to injury. There was clearly no remorse on the part of the chef and kitchen staff in serving us inedible beef. No apologies were ever offered. I learned the next day from the event host that the tenderloin beef was so far in quality from what they tasted during the food tasting before the event. Having said that, there were stellar people who made our stay really enjoyable --- Veronica the supervisor of the Ocean Club was the best, and the room attendant for 8016 (whose name I forgot but who I commended and cited by name in the survey form to the GM) was really cheerful and helpful!",Food:Value for money:Staff

It was our first visit to Cebu as well as your hotel. We are not quite used to big resort type of establishments, however with a young two-and-a-half-year-old, it seemed an easy short get-away option for us.

We were most pleasantly impressed, most notably by your staff.
We had Jun who met us at the airport and facilitated out transfer and arranged our luggage expeditiously. Checking in and checking out (by the same lady and I forget her name) was a breeze. She was professional, courteous and informative and openly advised us of our options.
We were escorted to our rooms by the lovely Charisse. Throughout our stay, Charisse spared no effort to greet us everyday with her lovely smile always asking after our well-being, ascertaining if there was anything else she could assist us with. She was marvelous at entertaining and showering much attention on our young son!
Eunice too made us feel very warm and welcome and assisted greatly where needed during our stay. She too went the extra mile entertaining our young lad. He was treated like a little rockstar!!

We had Teo outside as well who with a great smile and lots of enthusiasm, took our little son on a short ride on the golf cart as he displayed much interest in “Driving the golf cart” Thank you Teo, you made his day!!

Matter of fact, there was not a single staff member we walked past who did not pass on a sincere smile and a greeting. We were very much taken aback at the hospitality we received!
The service at the restaurants too were of high quality and a pleasure to receive!
The food was superb!

"A place to be here in cebu. If you want to unwind, relax and enjoy the nature, then i would definitely recommend this for its overall excellence. Also take a dive and see the sanctuary where you can find almost any marine life in the sea. This place is a paradise",
"My wife and I just spent 8 nights at the Shangri-la Mactan for both business and pleasure. The hotel is fabulous and the people are so friendly and professional. I travel 300 days a year and I have never had the attention and service I received during my stay.

My wife and I feel like we made 3 new daughters at the lobby bar. Sarah, Alex and Sheen are three of the most impressive young ladies we have ever met. We will be coming back to within the year just to see these 3 ""daughters"". Please make sure you see them in the Lobby Bar...unbelievable service, attention and now friendship. They represent the Shangri LA and are a big part of their 5 star rating.

we love shangri la, best hotel ever!!! the beach is clean and well maintained. well maintained garden and pool areas, everything is awesome!",Location:Food:Cleanliness
"What a great place to stay in, particularly if you have kids. Fantastic service, fantastic food, fantastic beach (where you can see and feed the fish). It was so nice we are already planning to go back.
Lots of nice activities for kids and adults. Great snorkeling experience. Best buffet breakfast and dinner ever (and this coming from a very fussy guest who has stayed in many different Shangri-la hotels around the world).
But most of all, the staff are the ones who set this resort apart from the rest. Wonderful people. You will feel pampered and spoiled.
Totally recommend it!",Food:Location:Staff
Its our favorite resort hotel in cebu!!!family friendly..big rooms..accomodating and very friendly staffs..superb breakfast buffet because of wide array of cuisines to choose from..Especially the egg benedicts in Acqua!!!

"This place was amazing, the room was massive! There was three of us so we purchased a double room with an extra bed, when we got to our room the standard bed was huge it wasn't necessary to purchase an extra bed. The Chi Spa is a must visit, it's the largest Chi Spa in asia. I had a villa all to myself, amazing therapist and service. Food was amazing too! However only downfall is that the place is incredibly expensive and they charge you on VAT, Food & Beverage Tax as well as another tax I can't remember. The place is great plenty to do just a bit pricey. Also one thing to note Mactan Island is far from the city and waiting for a Taxi at Shangrila takes a while.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"My husband and I stayed here last weekend for two nights in one of the Ocean Wing Club rooms and really enjoyed the stay.

The check-in was extremely quick (we were kindly given our room despite arriving early), service on the whole was very good and food/drink was surprisingly cheap for a Shangri-La hotel. The quality of food was generally OK which is always a plus point when travelling in the Philippines.

A special mention to Terence, the Club Lounge Manager who went out of his way to help us with a couple of requests. He sorted these out quickly and seemed to have a genuine eagerness to please - a very nice chap indeed and an asset to the hotel.

Will definitely be back.",Staff:Food

"Expensive but truly worth it for a 5star hotel. this is best to be with close friends and families. The beach is awesome with fishes even in the shallow part of the sea and you need not go far for snorkling, the shoreline is long. There are lots of pools to swim with, the infinity pool is great. We were also able to enjoy night swimming in the pool. The crew and staff are very warm, friendly and hospitable. Since we went in an off-peak season, they offered us free desert during our dinner, which was not part of our order. They also do not hesitate to take our group pictures. The rooms are spacious and elegant. Food is also great and the buffet breakfast as expected is very good with all the varieties to offer for an international buffet breakfast. Certainly this resort is heaven and paradise in one, very relaxing, best for unwinding with families and friends. I would love to be here again :)",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Stayed for 3 nights at the hotel, in a deluxe sea view room, package including breakfast. The resort is very large. The design is pretty standard, but a few areas are particularly nice and enjoyable in a very south east asian spirit, large grand open air/al fresco areas with fans on the ceilings allowing for a nice relaxing time with an outdoor feel. This hotel targets families since it has a lot of kids amenities, I have a little scared of that and noise/disturbance level, but I must say that It was decent and since the resort is so large it is easy to escape this. Overall I was pleased with my stay and the value of the stay was very good.

Very large hotel with good amenities
Good service overall, pleasant staff, willing to help
Pleasant rooms, spacious and clean.
Great breakfast and dinner buffet, particularly considering how average food usually is in this country. We had it included in our package, but price isn’t high if you need to buy it extra. Since the hotel is far from the city center it isn’t a bad idea to just stay in and enjoy their various restaurants
Very decent/moderate prices of all extra activities and food & Beverage
Free Wi-Fi across the entire resort, with good reception and decent speed everywhere, including beach, lawn areas etc…
Knowledgeable concierge
Super fast commute from airport, and fast check in-check out

----
Taxis from the hotel are a nightmare, very difficult to get any… and taxi team/staff isn’t very proactive in getting this improved. They come up with random excuses, but as soon as you raise your voice all of a sudden it gets easier and solutions come up. Shame. Many people complaining (already happened 2 years ago at my last stay… zero improvement there) and very little done to get this better
The waiters are the beach type bar/restaurant seems to be messing up a ton or orders, and/or process orders in a very random manners: both of us orders the exact same thing, but one came 15min before the other one… go figure… this is a Pilipino classic ! the 3 tables around us had something to complain about and ask for the manager to come over. Pretty poor service ! shame since food isn’t actually bad, and value for quality is decent.
Tv channels selection isn’t great
Hotel is very far from cebu city center, over 1hr taxi ride.
A certain lack of character when walking around the rooms. There is a feel of ‘large resort’ that targets mainland Chinese tourists.
Gym slightly outdated
Sadly for us we were there around a chinese bank holiday… and if you know mainland Chinese people you know how they behave around a food buffet…",Food:Internet:Location

"Quite late for a review since its been already 6 months since my last visit in Shangrila Mactan.

We have always loved Shangrila and all its glory, especially Shangrila Mactan since it is the one we frequent, but celebrating our wedding and reception here made me fully experience what the Shangrila signature is all about.

I would give our overall experience an 11/10. Yes, thats 1 point higher than 10. It really exceeded our expectations. From the ambiance, food, accommodation to the service - every single need, requirement, detail and request was delivered with a smile! My heartfelt thanks to Maureen Rendon, who arranged everything for us in Shangrila Mactan during our February 14 wedding. I would highly, doubly recommend this hotel / resort to vacationers, couples on a honeymoon, or even business conferences. Its an all in one destination!",Staff:Food
Stayed here a few years back but will always remember this as one of the most beautiful hotels I have had the fortune to have stayed in. Staff extremely attentive and rooms just divine. Really loved the colonial feel of the lobby bar and used the spa having one of the best foot massages anywhere.,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Still among the priciest but you get what you pay for --- room, food, pool, gym and the beach. The snorkeling safari used to be free but they charge for it now. They update the menu and the facilities regularly, but the buffet in Makati Shangri-La is better in terms of variety --- more seafood and desserts.

The hotel is about an hour's ride from downtown Cebu.",Value for money:Food:Location
"Stayed here as part of a wedding party. Given the standards I associate with the Shangri La brand I felt a little let down.

The setting is undeniably beautiful but doesn't appear unique for Mactan island.

The hotel seemed full or close to capacity and struggling to cope with the number of guests. We struggled to book Spa treatments and had to wait to be seated at breakfast time.

There's also clearly two quite different standards of room. We stayed in the garden wing where the decor and common areas were noticably tired compared to the more expensive Ocean wing. The Ocean wing is a genuine 5 star experience, the Garden Wing is not. The hotel does operate diffential pricing but just because Garden is cheaper didn't make it good value.

Mixed feelings about the staff as well. On a positive note I would commend the booking staff I dealt with who were honest enough to admit Bohol was too far to travel for a day trip and recommended my wife and I booked a separate hotel rather than extend our stay at Shangri La and make a day trip.

However, we got limited support from the concierge when we tried to organise our Bohol transfer. I appreciate that most transfers will just be to and from Cebu airport but from a 5 star establishment I expect staff to go the extra mile for guests. The hotel were not able to arrange ferry tickets for us and although we were dropped at the ferry terminal by a hotel car we ran into further difficulties getting tickets as we were dropped at the wrong place. By contrast our Bohol hotel, the Peacock Garden, made all the necessary arrangements for the return trip.

If you are considering something around the Shangri La price point, cast your eyes a bit further if you are expecting truly personalised service and genuine luxury.

This is commoditised luxury, at best.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Everything was lovely about this resort and the snorkelling was excellent... lots of fish which were easily attracted in the hundreds with free fish food. Even without the food they swim with you right up to the sand! The property is in very good condition, although was somewhat disappointed in paying so much for a suite with slightly shabby furniture. I believe part of the hotel has been updated and was disappointed not to have been in an updated room. The grounds are fabulous and the people extremely friendly and helpful. Would definitely go back.",Food:Value for money

"My husband and i together with our 3 kids stayed at the Ocean Club Room facing the sea. We were picked up at the airport by the hotel shuttle.
Check in was smooth and was quick.
The room: spacious, clean and sofa bed was prepared.
The beach was extremely clean with breathtaking view.

The kids especially enjoyed the pool area. I managed to get the babysitter service; hired 2 babysitters, 2 hours daily for 3 days for my 3 kids with very reasonable fee while my husband and i went snorkeling and relaxed at the beach.

At night we went to the e-zone and played some arcade games and left the kids at adventure zone.

We also enjoyed listening to the live band available at the lobby and also at the beach bar.

We had access to the Ocean Club lounge which served great breakfast with selection of Bento Box.
i had my fix of latte throughout the day and we looked forward for the cocktail sessions.

What i love the most about this resort is the staff. prior to our arrival, we had an exchange of email regarding my request for halal chicken. The F&B manager managed to fulfill my request.
the staff at the hotel from the lifeguards, waiters to the housekeeping were very polite and never once we were not greeted by them whenever we pass by. And i especially love the staff at the Ocean Club lounge. was there for 4 days and they were fast to notice that i love Latte and my kids love Iced Choclate and they would prepare one each in a go cup for us to bring back to the room. Isn't that sweet?

WiFii- strong signal wherever u are even at the beach!!!!

On our final night there, we planned last minute to celebrate my sons birthday in advance and ordered a half kg chocolate cake 4 hours before dinner. It was delicious and was delivered to us on time.

I used the Spa - best massage ever and I had the use of the yoga room for my own personal practice one day went it was too rainy outside.

"We stayed for 10 nights in August. In summary the hotel is not cheap but excellent for the primary reasons why we booked it as follows:
Facilities – It has loads: tennis courts (700Php/hr), pool tables (free next to the pool area but charged in the arcade machine area), arcade machines & air hockey (typically 20Php per go), table tennis, badminton, boules / petanque, putting green, crazy golf (250Php/person), Par 3 golf (600Php/person), basketball net in the pool, multiple pools (1 deep enough to dive into), and watersports. The hotel watersports included sailing (2500Php/hr for a hobie cat), jet ski (1500Php for 15mins), windsurfer, kayak (900Php/hr), paddle board. Even more expensive watersports are on offer from onsite Dive Scotty including scuba diving, banana boat, boat trips, etc.
Facilities for kids – This is perhaps the greatest attraction for the hotel. There are supervised kids clubs, children’s food area for breakfast, indoor soft play, dedicated pools, mini water slide with fountains, and a really good looking water slide with rubber rings. It is unfortunately only for under 12s, which my kids are no longer, so we kept getting asked why didn’t we come here when they are young?
Beach / Snorkelling – The beach is manmade and quite grainy sand, but understandable because you wouldn’t get a reef right next to the beach otherwise. A huge variety of fish literally just a couple of metres into the water. I have been to a few reefs and contrary to some comments is very much alive, with be best concentration and variety in such a small area so close to shore. Quite excellent. Fish food is free certain days of the week. There are also 2 pontoons to swim out to and dive into the sea which add to the fun.
Gardens – The gardens are huge and help absorb the number of people in the hotel which you notice in the morning at breakfast when it can be really busy and crowded. The well cut lawn areas, mature trees & plants create lovely spaces in which to relax.
Food – Great choice and quality for Breakfast. Lunch was good from the beach cafe, but at hotel prices. Drinks were hotel prices, but happy hour from 4.30pm (and then various other places around the site) where there was a selection at 2 for 1 every day make it ok. Dinner was not cheap so we ate out mostly, but room service was good and reasonable value. We did the Philippine themed night which was good with the entertainment included.
Other things - The service was very good and up there with the best of them. The hotel is very busy with plenty of kids, so if you wanted solitude then this may not be for you. There is a cash machine in lobby. WiFi throughout the hotel and gardens is strong and free.
Walking distance – Just outside the hotel 1/4 mile to the left is the Mactan Shrine with a monument to Lapu Lapu. It is set within a courtyard type garden which is well maintained, and has several souvenir stalls at cheap prices. To the right outside the hotel are 3 restaurants we used: Hola (Spanish about 50m away – Food was ok), Giuseppe (Italian about 400m away – Really good food and super ice cream), and Fiesta Bay (Pilipino about 500m away – Really good food), all good value with decent wine.
Local Trips – We did these ourselves with through a person just outside the gate (Jun Igot – 0939 834 5739). It was much cheaper for the same thing. Being 8 of us we got a good price and personal: Island Hopping – 1500Php/person (Excellent trip & lunch), Cebu Hills 2500Php/person (Tarsier, Loboc river, etc – Excellent), and Cebu Town (not much there really)
In summary the Hotel is a great place to stay with plenty to do, plus affordable options just outside in terms of eating and trips.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"You will not be disappointed if you stay here! The staff is beyond amazing. By the second day they knew my coffee order and where we wanted to sit by the pool! The food is wonderful-but beware the buffets can be pricey.
We loved snorkel safari-but if you are prone to motion sickness I would avoid the helmet dive! It is described as easy-your hair doesn't even get wet-but its not quite that easy and motion sickness is not one of the precautions listed!

"Room: stayed in the 9th floor with seaview. it was a great room coz there was a extra foldable bed. We just paid extra for the room upgrade because it was fully booked. Good thing they have a cot for us even if we asked late.
Amenities: My kids love adventure zone so much but just have to spend there for 1 hour which goes with their promo voucher. Just don't forget to bring long sleeves or jackets and socks coz you'll have to pay extra for the socks.
Beach: GREAT!! clean beach, plenty of toys for the kids to play sand castle, very easy to ask for towels and water. They provide food for the fish. My kids were so so amaze feeding the fishes in the beach. different kinds of fish.
Pool: im so glad they have an area for toddlers to dip and play. A covered area so they can swim for hours. Just don't forget to bring your own floaters coz they don't provide.
Was happy with the life guard coz i was watching my other daughter and my younger daughter went near the deep pool area and he was able to stop my daughter.
Breakfast: Wide variety of food. Although, we lined up going to breakfast but only for few minutes. All staff were very accommodating. There is a buffet for the toddlers as well . so happy.
Room service: My kids were craving for chicken. They improvised the chicken for the kids to make it crunchy and not spicy.
Checkin: it was a breeze. They provided welcome drinks.

"Many of us value our vacation time because it recharges us and for most, there is not a lot of time for these getaways. Well if that is the case for you, you have to stay at the Shang, Mactan. I left Manila from work at 730pm and was checked into my room and enjoying the view by 1130pm in Cebu, that same night. Flight, transfer, check in and everything. Upon arrival the hotel car sweeps you away to the property only 15-20 minutes away.

The staff here are extremely friendly and many have been with the property for over a decade. The F&B exceeded our expectations and the attentive service from Paolo at their buffet restaurant helped me put on my fair share of vacation weight, tip: get the adobo it is amazing.

Days of course flew by, due to the sole reason of having so many activities, 6 hole 18 par golf course in the morning, boxing after lunch, getting beaten by the tennis pro before dinner and then the next day enjoying their own personal Marine sanctuary not to mention their Jet Skis! Nato was the recreations supervisor who took amazing care of us and ensured we felt at home!

Overall an amazing stay, congratulations to Raj the Director of Rooms and Nicholas Smith the properties GM for being able to provide such an incredible experience.

"Besides being a breathtakingly beautiful place and excellent quality of accomodation, food and entertainment, the strongest point of the resort is its staff. Despite hosting thousands of people daily, they are capable of providing a personal care and creating a homey atmosphere. The staff, starting from the gardeners, through the managers, work very hard to serve every guest. They are very very kind, they smile and great all the time, they are very polite and helpful. To me the best thing in this resort was being around them.",Staff:Food
"The property is beautiful but the management needs to focus more on training the staff on customer's service. The staff lack attention and are very good at saying Good morning and good evening. You will probably get 100 of these a day but no service. The property I believe is meant for families. The downside is that they have a family day on Sunday and it attracts a large number of clientele which can over crowd the property, the pools and the beach. It gets really noisy and messy.

The F&B outlets are average, the seafood restaurant was disappointing. The breakfast buffet is ok and the Mediterranean restaurant is a good alternative.

The Chi spa is lovely, they provide a variety of amazing massages;however, if you are on a tight budget, this place might not appeal to you.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

Easy to reach from Cebu Airport.

What Shangri-La needs to learn is that guests are coming there for a healthy living and business too. So, please while the Spa is great and focusing on our health, make sure your food offerings are also meeting such high standards: price more vegetarian foods, both oriental and western (and not the single concept of 1-2 spicy Indian dishes). Even your salads were mixed with salmon and ham; please don't do that. Allow your guests to make their own mixes by offering at least 40% veggie en 60% non-veggie.",Food:Location:Staff

I could not get enough of this hotel. I wish i could check out at a much later time. They are kind enough to extend it to an hour at least.",Staff
"Excellent accommodation, service and staff. Worth every single penny. Perfect place to go for business functions, couples for a romantic getaway, family for a worthwhile bonding and friends for unlimited adventures! Definitely a five!",Staff
"This resort has an extra warmth from the staff which makes you feel welcome and like any request is possible, and for a price it usually was. Slightly dated Shangri-La with some oversights not expected in a 5 star resort, however an especially good choice for families with young children.

The Resident Manager was extremely visible on site proactively checking hotel equipment, F&B and engaging with staff and guests. In fact I've never seen a Manager with the energy, approachability & omnipresence of this lady. Her managing by walking around surely helps maintain the level of service.

CHILDREN
The staff were very attentive to children. As a parent this is a lovely touch. On our daughters 3rd birthday we were surprised & delighted at both Tides & the Club Lounge by a candle lit cake and staff singing happy birthday and proffering balloons.

The Adventure Zone is a haven for kids. The centre is staffed by cheerful ladies who run activities such as making pizza with Chef Massimo, decorating masks, painting t-shirts, making tie die t-shirts (whose colour runs completely on the first wash, beware), stringing necklaces etc.

Next to the crafts room is a play area which is 3 storeys of slides, ball pit, rope walkways, tunnels, staircases. I was glad to see the fireman pole was securely roped off. One of the slides is a sheer drop at the start, it is 100% supervised by an attendant & children must wear helmets. Across the corridor is an infant play area with ball pit and small slide and soft things to clamber over.

Thursday late afternoon there is an aerobics session on the grass next to the Adventure Zone. Lots of fun, even for little kids wiggling every which way, and lead by a powerhouse of a guy with huge charisma & all the moves. The front rows are the most keen, lean, lycra'd and in tune while the rest giggle along and crash doing the grapevine. A good laugh.

ROOMS
We stayed in a Mactan King Suite on the 8th floor as I had read a review on TripAdvisor that these rooms had been renovated fairly recently. The room was in good condition, the carpet was clean & retained little smell. The room was a good size for a family of 4 with a king, sofa double bed and pull down 'Murphy bed'. There was 1 nice full bathroom with a large shower and another separate WC with basin. IKEA step stools were provided for the children so they could reach the sink etc. The cleaning lady amused the children by making towel elephants. L'Occitane soaps, shampoo, body wash etc were plentiful.

I was impressed with the cleanliness. I've stayed in many tropical resorts, particularly in Hawaii and Guam, where the carpet is filthy and a dank smell pervades. At the S-L Mactan the staff are cleaning all the time. Early in the mornings I spotted the Activity Zone staff in the toddler ball pit cleaning each ball then throwing it back in the pit. The pebble mix paths were being power jet cleaned frequently. The man made beach is cleaned and seaweed crated away.

CLUB LOUNGE
The Club Lounge was in a good spot on the 8th (top) floor of the Ocean Wing with sweeping views towards the Movenpick Hotel and of occasional storm fronts.

The breakfast was ok as were the cakes and dinner canapés. The cheeseboard was artfully but precariously balanced & several guests almost upturned the whole thing. Cheese seemed to run out quickly, there was rarely Brie, Camembert or Blue. The staff were attentive and welcoming although overwhelmed at peak times.

During our first week the Club Lounge was very busy due to the resort being at 100% occupancy so an excellent 'Kids Club Lounge' was opened on the ground floor. Kids movies were shown on the big screen and the evening canapés were same as in the usual Club Lounge. The staff had a long way to go in order to fetch coffee & tea, apparently all the way to the Club Lounge. I was surprised there was no beverage facility available to them at neighbouring Tides.

POOL
My children had swimming lessons every morning with a superbly talented and patient teacher who is also the Head Life Guard.
The Life Guards were alert, whistles were blown for dangerous behaviour (your child is floating out to sea while you take selfies, don't swim next to the rocks...) and I saw several people assisted.

BEACH
The beach has clear water. The sand is not powder, more coarse, with a lot of crushed coral near the shore. Spikey sea urchins lurk in rocky crevices, handy to have reef shoes particularly at low tide.

There are many colourful fish near the shore and the resort provides fish food pellets on Mon, Wed, Fri which alarmed/delighted guests to have fish swarming around. Ecologically I suspect this messes with the biosphere, and given the Hotel lauds their 6 hectare marine park I was surprised guests were not at least prevented from feeding bread to the fish.

We saw blue starfish near the beach, giant clams near a pontoon as well as a sea snake.

There can be a lot of jellyfish a bit further out depending on the current. During my 2 week stay I saw several people stung with red welts of various intensities on their bodies. I saw jellyfish within 2 metres of the shore on 2 mornings & after my husband was stung & rapidly developed a hive our group exited the water. A purple flag was displayed indicating 'Marine Pests' however I thought the Hotel personnel I spoke to downplayed the severity/likelihood of the stings.

There appeared to be drainage outfall pipes located within 4 metres of the shore near the Ocean Wing.

Strangely, 2 of our group developed ear infections after swimming in the sea. Despite many seaside resort vacations this was the first time for both. Granted this could be multi factorial.

F&B
Cowrie Cove restaurant has an atmospheric setting, unfortunately the food was a bit hit and miss. Chef Paolo did a good job with BBQ prawns presented on blocks of Himalayan salt. Pistachio creme brûlée was divine. The steamed Lapu-Lapu was described as being cooked in a ginger soy sauce however the ginger was indistinguishable. The mango cheesecake was bland and solid.

The Lobby Lounge & Bar is ok, perhaps lacking the wow factor of others such as the woody Tanjung Aru. We had planned to have Sunday high tea but were put off by the acapella group murdering tunes. However, there was a fabulous band playing on Thursday. We ordered a Mojito and the bartender took a look at us, categorised us as Westerners, and put in 2 shots of rum. Almost knocked me out. Now that I know the cultural stereotype next time I'll specify I prefer Mojito on the weak side.

Tides does an excellent buffet lunch. Breakfast is good but get there early to avoid the queues.

Acqua was my favourite for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Scoops ice cream is good. Nice range of flavours. I wonder who makes it.

OUTSIDE the RESORT
The immediate area is mainly shanty town slums in stark contrast to the opulence and prices behind the hotel gates. There is a good Spanish restaurant outside the gates. Movenpick Hotel has a stylish Ibiza bar.

The hotel provides a shuttle bus to the Ayala & SM Malls every hour. The journey takes up to 1.5hrs, traffic is horrendous almost all day. A new glitzy mall is being constructed near the hotel which will be a relief during the midday heat & another opportunity to drop some holiday cash outside of the hotels limited, but hugely marked up offerings.

POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS:

- Provide vinegar on the beach for jellyfish stings.

- Healthier kids menu options for young children ie: plain cut vegetables, ham & cheese sandwich etc. While the Shangri-La kitchens would always cook whatever you asked for if they had the ingredients, only boutique hotels & Donald Trumps 'Healthy' offerings seem to have picked up that little Western kids normally want the plainest food and the average parent tries to feed them fruit and veggies. Most large chain hotels still stick with an outdated kids menu of what I consider mainly junk fried food options for kids.

- The main pool lacks sufficient sun lounger capacity. If the resort will not provide more shaded lounger areas at least put up a signboard on the main pool that sun loungers have a 20 minute rule. People were 'bagging' sun loungers at 06:30am then not showing up until 10:30am. This leads to frustration for people who do an early swim. The situation is more equitable at the Ocean Wing pool where the sun loungers are managed by the staff.

- Provide shade sails over areas of the main pool. Most clientele during my stay were ""SunSmart"" and the Asian customers are often head to toe in SPF clothing.

- Club Lounge smoking area could use a higher rated extraction fan. Every time someone went in there to light up, and invariably closed the door with smokers nonchalance, the entire Club Lounge would smell of cigarette smoke. Otherwise the room is gorgeous; wood panelled with comfortable coaches & windows on 2 sides. Such a shame a comfortable area of the same calibre was not provided on the other end of the Lounge for non smokers to enjoy.

- Shangri-La Tanjung Aru provides laundry facilities at the end of each guest room corridor, handy.

- Most of the wall mounted hand dryers don't work. I started to wonder if they were purely ornamental. The handicapped ladies toilet near the Lobby Lounge had no hand drying facility at all. Not what you expect from a 5 star property.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"The fishing feeding on the shore was the highlight of our stay. The staff are very approachable, nice and accomodating. The pool overlooking the beach is something, the buffet breakfast has lots of choices. The room is quite spacious and the room services are excellent",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Spent 4 days here in June 2015 with my 7-year old and a couple of similar aged friends. We didn't leave the resort the entire time! Plenty of activities to entertain the kids, including fish feeding (free food was given, I was kinda worried how they regulated the fish diet though!) , an indoor adventure playground, and a few pools with water playground and jets. We got a package which included some food (I think we paid like $200 for $250 worth of food..something like that.) and unlimited playtime for the indoor playground. The breakfast buffet also had a wide variety of international food and the lunch buffet we had had free kids buffet for every paying adult. Sure, the prices are higher than what we would probably pay outside the resort but reasonable for a 5-star hotel. And with the young kids, we didn't plan to leave due to safety and hygiene reasons, so it was great!

Rooms were typical Shangrila rooms, large, clean and well maintained. Had a faulty door and the guys were there to fix it promptly. Wifi was excellent throughout the resort too!

Highly recommended!",Value for money:Food
