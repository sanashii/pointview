"Shangri-la really has the best service. We were consistently impressed at their level of attention to detail in anticipating our needs. We had just come from a similarly rated hotel in Singapore and the difference in the level of service is huge! We felt very well taken care of.
Deluxe sea-view room was very comfy and had a great view of the water. Although the rainy season meant the cushions on the outdoor furniture and daybed were always wet. Urgh.
It's a little further than other resorts from White Beach and the main tourist area. But the resorts's own private beach is great too, not crowded, no touts!
Breakfast buffet offers a wonderful selection although their other meals are less impressive. We had dinner at Rima (treetop Italian restaurant) which is rated one of the best restaurants in Philippines. The atmosphere was fantastic, intimate and romantic. The ravioli and chocolate sofflue dessert that my husband had was great. But my own main - grilled snapper - was less exciting, a bit dry and uninspired. I've had better, a tad disappointing for what is supposedly one of the best restaurants in the nation.
We really liked their commitment to corporate social responsibility. Beyond the token self-benefiting choices hotels make (like only changing towels and linens when you indicate so), Shangrila really seems to make ecological choices that are probably more expensive for them like using salt water instead of chlorine in their pools. And closing the bat cave on their property to tourists for conservation purposes. Their eco-centre also does some great education work in the local schools.
Overall, we had a great experience and would consider coming back again. Although we would have appreciated some honeymoon extras though!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Everything well taken care of & anticipated to make one's stay the most comfortable. May seem expensive but the price paid is truly truly worth the value & experience. Especially for those that want to get away from the usual touristy spots, looking for a quiet relaxing stay to focus and recharge away from hustle & bustle. The room views are superb. Sunset and even the sunrise hours are a sight to behold from the rooms..",Value for money:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"From the moment they meet you at the airport till airport departure you are looked after extremely well. All the little extras were not missed & makes this resort a must. On meeting us were driven to the port, given refreshments before boarding the launch. On arrival to the island meet with golf buggies taken to reception, quick checkin then taken to our rooms.
Our rooms had amazing ocean views, spacious bathroom & bedroom with deck & sun loungers.
The beaches are beautiful, swimming pool stunning. The staff ( especially at the semi private beach) are amazing.
The only area they could improve was the dinner options, as we found the food a little bland. The seafood restaurant was over priced and tasteless, the main restaurant was average. We did enjoy the tree top restaurant the best. Pool beach side menu was great for lunch.
The spa was wonderful. This is a huge resort but, but there are plenty of golf buggies to drop you where ever you want to go.
Would highly recommend this resort, but would also recommend dining out.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Having stayed in the Loft villa, there's only one word to describe it and that's Awesome! Was totally pampered by Shangri-la's Boracay with a surprise birthday room upgrade from their Treetop villa, only to be made aware when we were already standing in one of their most luxurious signature villa. Everything were perfect, the services & experiences we received during our stay were remarkable, The attentiveness of their service was of top notch and there's nothing more that we could have asked for as every detail were being thoughtfully taken care of.

It was very sweet of the resort to have surprised me with a birthday cake in our living area and they were very meticulous on their housekeeping (they note when you are away from the villa and seize the time to speedily tidy your room without having you to request for it). Every service crew that we met around the resort were always smiling and happy, making us feel so welcomed and warm at heart. All in all, thumbs up to Shangri-la Boracay, thanks for making my stay in Boracay so wonderful and memorable.",Staff
"Boracay is beautiful but Shangri-la was a disappointment. The rooms were fair, bathrooms played up, and being such a huge property, it was hard to get around it as there were limited buggies. The staff were appallingly bad at looking after the guests. We paid 5 star prices, for what we felt were 4 star accommodation and 2 star service. They tried to double charge us several times, so please check your bills carefully. If you have a complaint about anything the staff waffle around and don't do anything. We had to demand a meeting with the GM to have unjustified charges removed.",Staff:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"Spent a weekend with my friends from college to spend quality time and reconnect. We were 7 and had 3 rooms. It was very peaceful and we had our privacy. Food was amazing, we had breakfast at Vinta and dinner at Serena, Serena was quite expensive for the food we ordered though, all in all it was good food, though just a bit too pricey. We had drinks at the beach bar (forgot its name) they have happy hour which is actually good if you drink mixed specialty drinks. We made use of the gym which was not crowded and excersized while blabbing. The pool was amazing but since it was a beach we preferred staying at the beach and just went to the pool as the waves got a bit stronger. We traveled with someone who walked on crutches and there was NO problem at all, very accessible for everyone. It was an amazing experience, we travelled under a promo and would do this again if the same promo was offered, no questions asked. Check out was easy and we didnt have an billing problems.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Amazing is the only word for this hotel, from check in to check out. The staff are lovely, the food is delicious and the cocktails are lush. The pool and the pool area is beautiful, it accommodates a lot of people while still feeling quite private. Prices are above average for Borocay, but worth every penney!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We have recently returned from a 7night stay in this hotel and I have mixed feelings about this hotel or rather more the management.

It was our 10 year wedding anniversary quite a milestone so we wanted to choose somewhere special to celebrate. My husband had never been to the Philippines so we decided on this hotel after so many positive reviews. Before we arrived I specifically sent an email to management to let him know of the big occasion to ask for recommendations etc and to see whether he would be so kind as to do something special to surprise my husband.

After an initial email response we arrived to... NOTHING. Not a visit, not a card. No acknowledgment of any kind. It was like we never corresponded.

We are a family of 5 and experience and avid travellers travelling every 3 months or so. We've stayed in the likes of the Four Seasons, the One and Only, Mandarin Oriental etc and everywhere that we have celebrated birthdays wedding anniversaries etc we have been lucky enough to receive upgrades, presents, cards and the like. Of course we are not entitled to any of these but it has always been a lovely gesture to receive and always well remembered and appreciated. I would have been happy if they had even said ""happy anniversary!"".

For such a big occasion it was a bit of a dampener especially from such an establishment.

The staff are great - unfailingly polite and friendly and the resort is beautiful.

But as any discerning traveller knows its the little extra attention to detail and customer service that separates a good hotel from a great one and just a visitor to a loyal customer.",Staff:Value for money
"everything about this resort is a wow! our holiday began when we arrived at their exclusive lounge at Caticlan jetty whilst waiting for their private speedboat to the most luxurious resort in this beautiful island of Boracay.

we regretted taking Southwest bus from Kalibo airport to Caticlan jetty which was only PHP 200 per person but way too time consuming as the bus journey took 2 hours + ridiculously 40 mins just to buy our bus ticket (noting there were only 3 customers in line but having 2 staff serve one customer at a time = zero sense of efficiency) + another 15 mins waiting time for the bus to move off. by the time we got to our room, it was almost 7pm when our Tiger Airways flight actually touched down before 3pm. so on our departure day, we decided to take a private car from Caticlan jetty to Kalibo airport instead and it took us only 1 hour hassle-free (PHP 1700 per car from Southwest).

we stayed 3 wonderful nights at the Deluxe Seaview on the highest floor overlooking the best seaview from Punta Bunga beach and the jetty. room is spaciously clean with a super king size bed, a nice private balcony with two relaxing daybeds, separate rainshower and a bathtub. breakfast was a good spread though it got bored after the 2nd day. the regular shuttle to D’Mall is a big plus so we had most meals outside the resort except for one long lazy lunch of pizza and wings by the pool until sunset (their fried chicken wings are worth recommending with special bbq sauce on the side).

White Beach has finer white sand as compared to the two private beaches at the resort but we appreciate the privacy away from the crowd and touters. service standards are impeccable, the resort is beautiful and by far the most luxurious in Boracay.

ps: if you want to book any activities, please contact Emmanuel (Tel: +63 (0) 915 686 1638). he’s a very nice local guide who charges reasonably for island hopping (PHP 1700 for 2 paxs for a private banca, lunch not included) and sunset cruise (PHP 800 for 2 paxs for a shared paraw sailboat). if you dare for some sea urchin sashimi, he can fish from the sea during island hopping and cut open for you. he can also arrange cheaper prices for seafood at D'Talipapa (save the haggling).",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Thank you Shangri-La for an amazing holiday!
My girlfriend and I booked the Shangri-la for a quick weekend getaway before the wet season hits and had an amazing experience.

We initially booked to stay in a loft villa after hearing some great things about this room from friends who had stayed there. Due to a slight booking error, we were assigned to a different type of room (which was also a beautiful room in itself, however not what we were looking for).
Without hassle, the staff at the resort did their best to resolve the issue and move us into the room which we initially booked - during this time, giving us full access to the room that they had originally assigned us to. Tatiana was the hotel coordinator who listened to our concerns attentively, and made arrangements to ascertain that our needs are met. While waiting for her to resolve the concern (which she diligently provided updates on), we were told to enjoy the pool villa where we were brought to. Our temporary butler, Vicente, was great – he gave us a tour of the villa and was very prompt in responding to our needs and questions.
Around an hour later, the duty manager called and advised that there were no Loft Villas available, as a result they would be moving us to the Presidential Villa (Which was absolute paradise)!

This was fantastic, and unexpected service – Our experience was their #1 priority and we couldn’t have felt more appreciated as customers!

The duty manager (unfortunately, we did not get his name), along with Tatiana, came to pick us up in the pool villa – he apologized for the booking issue and even drove us to the Presidential Villa!

This resort is absolutely beautiful, and one of the nicest places I have ever stayed at (if not the nicest). The accommodations are nice, large, clean and comfortable, the resort gardens and pools are beautiful and the 2 private beaches are also very picturesque with the turquoise Boracay water. Our new butler, Mike/Michael, was very personable, professional, and prompt!

What really sets this place apart from the rest is the amazing service from staff – When flying to Caticlan, a Shangri-la staff member will greet you as soon as you get off the plane, you will be driven straight to hotel’s private waiting room for the boat transfer. The boats take you directly to the resort where you will be greeted by a member of the team and taken straight to your room to be checked in – no waiting around, no hassle about boat transfers, waiting in the hotel lobby etc. This service continues during the entire stay, from staff stopping to drive you in the golf buggy when they see you walking, to the great service at dinner. Every little detail of this resort is thought of, and perfected.

We are both definite advocates of this resort, and will be returning (hopefully soon!)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"My third time to stay here and ALWAYS the same kind of Exceptional service!
Whenever one stays in Shangri-la, it is the BEST hotel, bar none.

Food is exceptional and you are sure to be sated all the time.
The POOL! Simply the best quality of water and design.

"We were on a four day reconnaissance mission ahead of a rather important wedding next year. Perhaps, therefore, we were assessing the Shangri-La in Boracay a little more carefully than we might have done in other circumstances.

Unfailingly polite and helpful was every single member of staff. They say the Philippines is a land of smiles and it certainly was on this occasion.

We arrived at the Caticlan airstrip, were met by hotel staff and taken to the Shangri-La jetty for our speedboat trip across the channel to Boracay. Alas, sea conditions meant that we had to leave from another beach a few miles along the coast and then land on the north side of Boracay. A minor inconvenience and not even the Shangri-la can control Mother Nature.

Check-in was painless and we were lucky enough to be upgraded to a deluxe sea view room in the Timog wing. Excellent room amenities and a splendid view over the beach and towards the rocky outcrop separating the hotel's private beach from the one below us.

Restaurants include the Vintana where we had four massive breakfast buffet sessions and dinner on two occasions. A very good selection of Philippino and other Asian dishes plus all the usual white man's food and, of course, refreshingly cold San Mig. Service absolutely excellent.

We tried the Chi Spa for a 60 minute massage, taking advantage of a 1,500 peso discount voucher. Our therapists were both very good. On day two, we tried the hotel's main swimming pool which, to our pleasant surprise, was salt water not chlorinated. On days three and four, the sea was calmer so we went swimming there instead.

One particularly onerous task involved sampling some food for the wedding next year. Everything was of the highest quality and we have no doubt that the guests will appreciate everything.

We went back to the mainland and, unfortunately, reality after a superb four day break.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Having just returned from the Shangri-La in Boracay it is easy to say that this hotel has got it nailed. From the way the staff collect you at the airport, to the refreshments on arrival at the port, to the amazing speedboat ride to the island and to the greeting you receive once at the hotel. The setting for the resort is out of this world....a true piece of paradise. The rooms, decor, food, pool, beach just to name a few are absolutely stunning. The staff are amazing and can not do enough for you....a smile and a friendly hello goes a long way...and visa versa. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who needs a little bit of paradise in their lifes. The only negative thing was we had to unfortunately leave as with all holidays they eventually come to an end.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Stayed in this hotel at room 413 from May 31 to June 3, 2014.
Approximatelly GBP 1000 were blocked as guarantee on our credit card at check in, which is a common practice.
The problem is that two weeks later, the amount has not been released by the hotel because they still have not notified the credit card issuing bank. My credit card issuer has a policy that reverses the funds immediatelly upon receiving a hotel guarrantee cancellation (which is supposed to happen at check out).
The most annoying part is that I have to keep calling the hotel, explaining my problem. Every single incompetent person I spoke to, gave me a different explanation for the delay, but, two weeks on the amount has not been reversed. I believe you all understand how annoying this can get. This is not a nice holiday end.",Value for money:Staff
"First of all... I just want to say.. Ya whatever. Its worth the $ to stay here. If you are going to Boracay this is the only place to stay. Its the best place thats for sure.

The moment you land and get into the airport they are already greeting you with a sign so they can help you.... If I can remember ""Butch Ramos"" was the guy that helped us and he was helpful all the way and super nice.

Then you take a Van to the private Shangri La waiting area where the staff their are very attentive with a smile and give you some welcome drinks.

Usually you take their private jet boat straight to the resort but when we arrive the waves were rough so we had to take a Van to the backside of the island and take a different way.

Whatever it worked out and we arrived at the Shangri La. First class staff all the way. Everybody smiles and says Hi. I noticed that every single staff was nice and said Hi, good morning, good afternoon... I give props to the management because I can tell the leader ship is strong.

I must also mention that we did have the Seaview Suite that was very spacious and a nice view. They also provided us with our own Butler... Joyce! We didnt have to use her much but she did a great job and was very attentive to us. Thanks Joyce!

Getting to the main part of Boracay they had a shuttle van that drops you off into the center of the harsh tourist area and they pick you up to... At the pickup/drop off point their is a sign that says Shangri La so the guest have a easy time to find it... Not only that... They have like a liason staff working there making sure the guests are ok and he was very attentive. I remembered his name. Jomar... He did a great job making sure everybody was ok and answered any questions or concerns. I hope he gets recognized and that their is a chance for advancement within the Shangri La organization because I thought he was a great part of the experience.

Anyways to wrap up this review... The infinity pool is great, the gym facilities are first class, the spa is amazing... I have stayed at a lof of places but I will say that so far... Shangri La Boracay is the best place overall for what type of place it is... Service and Ambience just everything... Very good. Breakfast buffett = Best i have ever had anywhere. Bar none. Amazing.

I know this is a Shangri La review but I will also say that Fairmont Makati I enjoyed great service to... So if you do come to Manila and Boracay... These are the places to stay with out a doubt!

Hope my reviews help!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I recently stayed at the Shangri La on Boracay and it was the most wonderful experience I have had ever had. I cannot fault the resort at all. From the moment we stepped off the plane in Boracay to the moment we stepped back on that plane we were treated like stars. The service was impeccable. I cannot fault it in any way. The staff were super friendly and always happy to help in any aspect they could. The resort was kept immaculate and was so beautiful and clean. There was a great selection of restaurants and the food was of a very high standard. My family (consisting of 2 adults and 2 kids under 10) were so impressed with our stay at Shangri La Boracay. Every aspect of our trip was made perfect by the staff. The location is just breathtaking. You have to see it to believe it really! Wonderful holiday, great resort. Kids activities were held regularly throughout the day and the Adventure Zone was enjoyed by my 2 children and the staff in the Adventure Zone were also very friendly.",Staff:Food:Location
"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights in May. We booked a Deluxe Seaview Room (number 637), which happened to be a corner room on the highest floor – great views!

This is a beautiful world-class hotel, with the best location in all of Boracay. Genuine smiles and warmth from the staff – who provided great service.

Highlights:

Breakfast, wow! Amazing selection of incredible food… the best hotel breakfast service I have ever experienced.

Swimming pools – beautifully designed and great to watch the sunsets from.

Rima Restaurant – unfortunately we only discovered this secluded restaurant on the final night of our stay. Amazing food and incredible service!

A couple of minor criticisms:

When we first arrived, no welcome drinks or cold face towels were offered. Yet other guests who arrived at the same time as us, were catered for - I guess we weren’t noticed.

Also, 2-3 times the orders we made at the Alon Beach Bar were quite slow in arriving and possibly forgotten about on one occasion.

But these flaws were minor and didn’t lessen our amazing experience - we can’t wait to return!",Food:Location:Staff
"We went at a very busy time (the week right before school started in the Philippines) but even with so many people, the service and everything was excellent! We went to D-mall and to the station 1 beach which does have the best sand, but honestly the privacy of the beach at Shangri-la is farrrrr better than sharing a beach with finer sand. Me and my girlfriend actually preferred just staying on the resort, secluded and away from all the crowds/messiness at D-mall. At night time, you can enjoy the sunset with live music, its quiet and relaxing versus cramming in with other people at the stations. Breakfast buffet was amazingly good, they had everything! But if you go late, you would have to wait, but just for max 5 minutes. Worthy of a 5 star rating and more. The shuttle to D-mall however was sometimes annoying if you didn't catch the timing, but we only left the resort just for Dinner (as the restaurants at the resort were quite expensive). Besides that, you pretty much do not have to leave the resort (unless you want to do water activities at a cheaper price). Place is perfect for families/couples. Our room was the Deluxe Seaview Room, highly recommended, clean/spacious and what a nice view to wake up to! If you go to Boracay, might as well make it worth your while and stay at this hotel!",Food:Value for money:Location
"Relative to hotels ive stayed in elsewhere in the world, excellent value for the attentiveness of staff and facilities. Staff throughout the hotel knew us by name. And if youre looking for a quiet stay in Boracay with occasional access to party areas on the island, this hotel is the way to do it",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"There is no doubt that the landscaping, beachfront (albeit small) and architecture are impressive. The pool area lay-out offers more shaded areas compared to Shangri-La Cebu or Shangri-La Rasa Ria resorts. They have more complimentary amenities for adults and children but where they are lacking is in the area of food service. Their menu offering for casual dining is rather plain and ordinary. Their service wait staff are reluctant to take the service to the next level - that of delighting customers.
We ordered a Margherita pizza from Cielo. Cielo claims that they serve gourmet oven-baked pizza - and what we were served was an ordinary cheese pizza. It looked like it came from Pizza Hut ( no basil leaves nor tomato slices, no buffalo mozzarella) we asked for a replacement and their Italian chef came to our table, he explained that what we got was indeed a Margherita pizza. The motto of their Italian chef by the way is ""I make sure that we...serve them as they should be."" I'm quite certain that they do not serve the Margherita pizza that way in Naples. So they took our pizza, and it was recycled and sent to our table as the same pizza with added basil leaves, tomato and buffalo mozzarella on top. For a luxury resort that charges US$ 350-500/night, you would expect a higher level of service. We were not expecting that the kitchen would be too cheap (or lazy) to make a fresh pizza.

On another incident, we wanted to take our lunch at the Lobby lounge, but wanted one of the items from Vintana, but we were denied of this option saying that they cannot bring one of the menu items from another restaurant (though they can set up lunch or dinner anywhere you want at the resort or offer room service).",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

"My wife and I stayed at Shangri-la Boracay for 4 nights and we were blown away by the quality of the hotel amenities and the impeccable service. This is one of rarer instance where the saying ""you get what you pay for"" actually held true. The attention to detail is apparent throughout and they spared no expense in making the resort appear to be part of the landscape as opposed to the typical concrete blocks that are all over Boracay nowadays.

From the moment we landed in Caticlan we were met by Shangri-la staff who took care of our luggage and transfer to the port 5 minutes away. They had a lounge at the port where we were served refreshments while waiting for the resort's private speedboat to ferry us to Boracay.

Check-in was a breeze and we got the deluxe sea view room that we booked. The room was on the top floor of the southern building and had an amazing view of the semi-private beach (split with the resort next door). The room was clean, cool and is well appointed. The balcony had two lounge chairs were you can lay down and admire the white sand beach and turquoise waters below. Waking up to that view every morning was wonderful.

They give you free water in the rooms daily as well as a small basket of fresh fruits. Housekeeping was on task and a turn down service was offered every night. The complimentary bottle of wine our first night was greatly appreciated. There is fast and free wireless internet everywhere in the resort. I was even able to Skype with family while laying on the beach! The breakfast buffet was good with a good mix of Filipino, Chinese and Continental food. We also spent a good deal of time in their private beach and around their amazing infinity pool that overlooks the beach. You are only 15 minutes away via the free hotel shuttles from the hustle and bustle of D'Mall and station 2.

Do not miss: watching the sunset at Solana bar and a nice seafood dinner at Sirena. Ask for the special dinners - we missed a seafood dinner buffet right on the beach on our last night.

The only bad thing about staying at Shangri-la is you wouldn't ever want to stay at another resort in Boracay.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"We just spent a week at the Shang Boracay. Having stayed at beach resorts from Brazil to the Gulf of Thailand, this is by far the best in terms of service, architectural beauty, comfort and attention to details. The entire resort, which is quite large, sits on the high Northwestern tip of Boracay Island. As such, it is far removed from the heavy crowds and overall tackiness of White Beach Center and D-Mall. The grounds, architectural detail, and art work found in the open air public spaces as well as the superbly appointed guest rooms are outstanding. Nothing has been spared in advance of the overall concept of refined luxury. For example, one expects to find high thread count bed linens in a five star property, but a feather weight comforter that warms without weighing one down? Rare, but the difference in comfort is unmistakable.

Others have already written here about the amazingly high level of service here, and it is indeed outstanding. On so many occasions staff here went out of their way to accommodate our needs. For example, staff don't just meet guests at the Caliclan airport, they retrieve bags from the belt. On return, they take care of everything, including check in! Many times staff anticipated our needs and took action even before we expressed them.

The only downside during our stay was the food service. Breakfasts here can be a bit bland. Further, we tried all the restaurants here, including the signature Rima, and found them all rather underwhelming, especially considering the prices charged. Anyone staying here should consider taking the resort vans to Central White Beach for better and more reasonably priced dinners. Of the restaurants here, we found the Serena seafood restaurant to be somewhat better than the others.

Room tip: Go for a sea view room at minimum and if price is not a concern, book a tree top or pool villa.

Overall, while we have stayed at several other resorts on Boracay, none even come close to the Shangri-la. It is simply the best by a wide margin.",Food:Staff:Value for money

"We were never crazy about going to Boracay, because of how it had changed since the early '80s but this Shangri-La changed out opinion. It is environmentally snuggled into the hillside without too much visible impact,and their beach is secluded and not crowded. Of course, if you want to go to d'Mall area, there is a bus leaving every hour and at certain times every half hour. (We were here in May, and it was quite hot, so the timing of the bus can be important for some people).

The service, especially in the restaurants was excellent, much better than Shangri-La Makati or Ortigas, and the food was also fresh (and local) and tasty with different options to the normal. The morning buffet has just about everything you can want, including ice cream. All the staff speak excellent English so communication is not a problem.

The rooms are Shangri-La quality, clean and nicely appointed. From what we could tell almost all the rooms have good views. We did tour the villas, and they are beautiful with private pools or the tree-top villas apparently have hot tubs.

The only issue we had was the A/C would shutoff during the night (not sure if this because of a change over in generator power, or some other reason.

The pickup from the airport to the hotel and then back, went smoothly and the boat ride very nice and fast with an overview of the Boracay beach area.

"If I will go back to Boracay, I would prepare to stay again at Shangri-la Boracay Resort & Spa. You can't find any other place like Shangri-la Resort starting with the crew, facilities and food, it's excellent.:) It's an awesome and amazing place to stay. Thank you Shangri-la Boracay for the great place to stay. God bless and more power.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"The best hotel in Boracay!
We stayed with my fiancee in Shangri La only for four days unfortunately, if we had more time we would stay there forever.... Very profesional meeting of guests, organised, what makes you feel more special than other tourists at the airport. We arrived in the afternoon, so we had an express check in. The personel is excellet, they anticipated always our needs on the beach, at the pool, at the restaurant, everywere tou are met and greeted! Beautiful teritory! You gave to stay there minimum 10 days to manage to see all the breathtaking sunsets from numerous places in Shangri La. Is very clean and green. We had a feeling that the big, romantic pool, the see is only ours, everything seems to be so privat, so unbilievable and peaceful...
The seafood in Sirena is fresh and very well done! You have always fresh fruits in your room...
We went to see the white beach in station 1 , where the Willy's Rock is, and there are lots of restaurants, hotels, but is so noisy and crowded, that one visit there was enough, we went back to out secluded, privat Shangri La!
All the money that you pat there, for accommodation, service, food is worthy ! You will not find anywere in Boracay this type of luxurious treatment ! We stayed in many 5 star hotels around the world, and we usually dont go back to the same place, but Shangri La in Boracay made us to dream about our return there... We loved it... Thank you ShangriLa for the unforgetable experience and thousands of photos !",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Most Shangri-La properties have very good hotel facilities but I was very impressed with the service of all staff at this location. Every part of the hotel was a pleasant & relaxing experience (breakfast, beach, pool, housekeeping, bar, transfers, etc.....). Beyond this, the effort they made to locate my delayed/lost luggage and help with missing necessities was much appreciated and I am sure I would not have received my bag by the second day (or ever) if not for their help. To contrast SL customer service vs. the rude/indifferent PAirlines staff for something that was not even their fault was like night & day. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. Shangri-La has certainly earned future business from me at this location and others in the future. I highly recommend the hotel to everyone for any occasion.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We had our annual family vacation in Shangri-la Boracay. From the moment we arrive in caticlan airport, we were greeted and assisted by the staff of the resort. They took care of everything. Lounge at the seaport was excellent, had a cold refreshing towel and cold dalandan juice. As soon as we arrived at the jettyport of the resort, buggys were waiting for us and we were brought directly to our rooms. Chec-in and check-out in our rooms. We were greeted by Mr. Arif, the resort manager, who was all around the resort, restos, beach making sure that everything was in order. He always made sure that whatever we requested was given to us, amazing and excellent service. Our butler, Michael was probably the best thing in the resort. If you want a relaxing vacation, with no worries, Shangri-la Boracay should be the place. Will definitely be back.",Staff:Food
A fantastic place and service! Great staff! The breakfast buffet was very good and food was amazing! I would definitely stay there again and advise everyone to stay there! It supposed to be the best hotel in boracay and from my experience I can just agree on it!,Food:Staff
"We are a family of 5, with two teenage children aged 13 and 15. We chose to stay in a Premier Family room (which could fit all of us as it had two queen beds), but when we checked-in, we were still required to pay for extra person fee. We did not need an extra bed, they should have just charged us for the breakfast for our children. We do not find it reasonable as well as safe to allow children aged 13 and 15 to be in a separate room on their own, that's is why we chose the more expensive Premier Family room so we can all be together. I do not mean to nag but for a 5-star resort, this type of child policy is ridiculous. And to charge us additional upon check-in, it is absurd.

Other than that, I give five stars to the resorts beauty, cleanliness and staff around the pool.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"This resort came highly recommended so we booked for 6 nights for part of our Honeymoon. We were absolutely amazed by this resort. We stayed in a tree top villa and although this was expensive it was worth every dollar. From the moment we were greeted at the airport until we were dropped off a week later we were treated like royalty.
The facilities at the resort are perfect, the staff are nothing short of brilliant and the resort itself is perfectly situated at the end of the peninsular. We spent some time in Boracay town (Station 1 and 2) which is easy with the free shuttle bus provided by Shangrila.
Although we stayed over Easter (Holy Week) and the resort was almost at capacity it did not feel like it which made our time there even more special.

A bit more detail:

Accommodation - Although we stayed in a tree top villa I am sure that the standard rooms are very nice too and we would consider staying there next time. As you will see on the website the tree top villas are split level with the bedroom downstairs and living room/terrace upstairs. Little things like complimentary still and sparking water, free buggy service on demand and a local mobile phone with your butlers number stored make this level of accommodation worth the extra cost. Our butler Suzette was fantastic and went to extra lengths to make sure our honeymoon was special like running baths for us and scattering rose petals through the room each night. Nothing was too hard to organise including external tours for which the Shangrila did not charge us for.

Spa - wow is all we can say; the Spa is the best we have ever experienced. Get there a bit early so you can enjoy the private pool before your massage.

Beach & bar - both beaches are very nice and the service is excellent. Happy hour at the private beach is great with 2 for 1 cocktails - works out at USD $3 - $5 per cocktail which is great considering where you are.

Dining - we ate at the poolside restaurant which is a great casual experience; the Italian restaurant is very nice too and reasonably priced. Our best dinner was a private dinner on the beach which was just an amazing experience. Highly recommend for anyone visiting.

Diving - we chose to book through a dive centre in Boracay rather than the resort because of the cost. Although diving direct from the resort would be easier we saved about 1000 pesos per person by booking through a dive centre instead.Something to consider. The diving in around Boracay is very good although a little crowded while we were there - probably due to the Easter weekend.

Other - if you are in Boracay and like cliff diving book a day trip out to Ariels Point; really fun experience.

In summary A beautiful experience, we will be back.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We stayed 4nights in Seaview #5*7 (how can i forget the suite #). Was hesitant at first because of price & location; far from the famous white beach. But during our stay (Apr 28-May2) i never had a problem going back & forth to the town/ D Mall as their free shuttle is every 30min till 5pm & every hour until 1am. Buffet breakfast exceeded my expectations..so many options.Friendly Restaurant staff too. Beach bar serves happy hour too! i opted for Mojito (strong&yummy) We only tried one restaurant Sirena, quality food, we chose a balcony/treetop seating. Expensive but worth it. Infinity pool & sunset..spectacular!

"Visited on August, coming from Manila to Caticlan airport, there's private resort transfer by van and speed boat both are privately own by Shangri-La. upon check in we directly went to the villa and hotel receptionist will do the check in process in the villa and butler will show you around the villa, you will be given a phone that can call your butler for service. The room, living hall, wash room and the jacuzzi balcony are same just like the pictures shows in the website.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We arrived 1st May evening coming in from Manila via Kalibo airport. The reception was very good and the pickup and transfer by van and speedboat via Caticlan was just perfect. The van and even the vaiting area had WiFi coverage (!).
We had a standard room that was nothing special and a bit less than expected at an overpriced resort. It is an enormous resort and it contains more or less everything you need and can dream of.
Massage was good. SCUBA diving technically and service wise fine, but nothing special to see. Do not go to Boracay for diving if you have been at Maldives etc.
Food wise we did not suffer at all, but there are flaws that should be commented. The Lobby Lounge area is not recommended for breakfast, there we just were ""invisible"" and got very little service attention. The Vintana is just ok for breakfast but not at all on par with for example Shangri-La in Singapore. For dinner we recommend to forget about Vintana, it is nothing special about the buffet. Seafood totally dried out and ice cream served in paper cups, and waiters only remotely interested in serving you. Again we did not suffer but this is not acceptable for a resort of this category.

Last but not least we would like to highlight the most positive experience, the Rima, their Italian tree-top dinner restaurant. Excellent from A-Z. Very professional waiters and the food and wine was 100%. Thank you.",Food
"overall my stay was very good. the facilities are excellent. and the place is excellent, except for some minor problems in our room arrangements. The room was readied late around 5pm and they fail to inform us. we have to follow up every our for it. We book for 3 in a room but at 9pm the room wasn't yet set for 3.",Comfort & Facilities
"Me and the love of my life visited this place to celebrate our 11th year anniversary together and I must say that we loved every bit of this resort. From the jetty port lounge, they welcomed us with refreshing towels and drinks. After signing up, the butlers took us to our speed boat and brought us to the resort. It was just us. We were welcomed and picked up by a buggy service and we were brought to the lobby to check in. We stayed in a room with a view of the sea that made us experience watching the beautiful sunset during our 3 nights stay there.

The sand in the private beach area is different from the powdery sand of the main beach but it's still white, and lovely! Try ordering pizza and beer while soaking under the sun, it's great!

We didn't even wanna go to the White Beach / main beach anymore because the resort is paradise on its own.

The resort is about 15 minutes far from the main Boracay beach but the resort has shuttle services that leave on time, every hour, and every thirty minutes starting 6PM. When you get to to the D'Mall drop off point, a resort staff is there to welcome you and assist you when you want to take the shuttle service back to the hotel.

The walk from the rooms to the breakfast / dining halls may be a little far but the buggy services made it so easy for us. The pool is great too, try finding the corners where you can press a button to get that jacuzzi feel.

The fitness gym is also a must try. They have a jacuzzi inside and very clean locker and shower rooms.

Breakfast, food, room service, everything's just amazing! It was all worth it. We ended our trip with a promise that we'll come back. It felt like home for us.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"First time in Philippines and we very much like the country. As we were exploring the country we decided to go to Shangri la is a great choice. Very friendly staff and great service. During our stay the Hotel was several Times completely booked out, but no problem to find sunbeds on theach, restaurants or breakfast. And with a villa you can escape always to your island on the island... Food is a bit pricy but okay. Booth beaches are great... However, the semi-private one is less busy and even more relaxing. Spa is nice but average. We will return to this place but would like to check Amanpulo to experience the difference....sometimes the many functions are bothering. And in other resorts with villas they are better maintained (not so clean cushions etc)",Food:Staff:Location
"If you just need to get away from the noise and stressful life, Shangrila is the best place to stay for family bonding, and honeymoon escapades... not much recommended for groups since their location is very secluded and they have noise restrictions though they also have fantastic amenities and great food..However, since their Sales people is based in Manila office and the one who will handle the event itself is a different person who is based in Boracay, Shangrila lacks personalized and passionate service for Groups which is very transparent from other Resort Hotels we have stayed before..so, the feeling of coming back again for Team Building activities is not present. Their Sales people is great in convincing you to stay and held your event at the location but execution at the place itself doesn't meet your expectations anymore. They dont exert much effort to make your functions lively as they are very dull in their themed decorations or functions to think we have already paid additional cost for that, ...However, to be fair, they are good in handling their guests who comes as family and as an individual or couple...Another thing, I also don't understand their automatic shut off at night wherein guest will experience waking up just to turn the aircon on again..Perhaps, I would like to come back but only with family for bonding time but not ever again as a group of 170 pax for 2 batches....",Comfort & Facilities

They have some promotions on their website for some free perks but its just a bait, dont fall for it. They will not give it to you automatically if you dont asks even though you qualify for that promotion. Overall, we are disappointed with our stay here.",Staff:Value for money
"Had the chance to stay in a Loft Villa with my family and everyone loved it. The view from the private infinity pool was mesmerizing. You could literally just gaze out to the sea while soaking in the pool for hours. Alternatively, you can lounge in one of the day beds by the pool and likewise stare at the view and get lost in thought.

The only thing better than the villa was the service that we got from our assigned butler Lucel. All of our needs were looked after. All of our requests were fulfilled. Aside from her, everyone else from our arrival to departure were pleasingly helpful.

If there was anything that the place could stand a bit of improvement was the food. The pasta and pizza we had one lunch wasn't necessarily bad. It just wasn't that good either, considering that they cost more than you'd pay for a better version outside the resort.

Even the breakfast spread had items that were poorly prepared. I didn't like the dim sum and the japanese maki rolls in particular. To be fair, that breakfast spread had a good selection that you'd surely find something that suits you. The bread selection to me stood out.

I couldn't end this review without mentioning the entertainment center and the main pool area which were fantastic places to while your time away. And Banyugan beach was perfect for a swim.

It was my first time to go to Boracay, having shied away from the place because of the notoriety of the crowds. We made a wise decision to book here in Shangri-la for the privacy it offered.",Food:Location

Grounds were gorgeous. We enjoyed the privacy and exclusivity afforded by the size of the resort, its many walkways and paths, its two well-kept beaches, and the wonderful staff. The room was a lovely affair, a good size, in great condition and very comfortable. Decor was great- local and global fused beautifully. Although the resort was rather full (based on the breakfast crowd at Vintana's), we never felt overrun or intruded upon. We could always find a lovely place to stay and just chat. Great dinner at the cliffside rest. (Must have the lobster toast again next time).",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

We actually stayed the first couple of days in a well rated hotel on the White Beach. However, when we arrived at the Shangri-La we immediately felt that this is the nicer spot. Service is friendly and the whole environment has the athmosphere of a 5 star hotel. The gym is fantastic and the breakfast is also what you would like to have while on vacation. The water is crystal clear and because it is a bit deeper it is also much cleaner as on the White Beach! Hotel is top - we loved it there!",Comfort & Facilities:Food

We arrived from Kalibo airport after quite a tiring 90-minute drive. Scenic route through.

Most of the hotel staff were very well trained. Special mention to Jessa from the Front Office and Lito the highly attentive lifeguard. I am surprised some of the highly trained staff, like Jessa, have not be poached by top hotels in Hong Kong or Singapore.

We have stayed at Shangrila Cebu before and our conclusion is that for couples, Boracay is better, but for families, Shangrila Cebu is the place to be.

Kalibo Airport was a mess on the way back. You have at least 1,000 people waiting in an area meant for 100. We had to sit on the floor and the toilets were not working. Don't let this put you off. Just enjoy the experience.",Food:Location
"Not a title that is written liberally however having frequented the Four Seasons Langkawi, The St Regis Bali and The Trisara in Thailand (all superb) I have to save The Shangri-La Boracay in my opinion exceeds them.

Everything about the resort is first class, there is simply no need to leave the resort. The staff as well as the surroundings and over all feel of the hotel make this resort special and there are simply not enough superlatives to write about everyone however special mention must go to Mr. Oberoi, Pinky, Arif, Josef and Allen. One member of staff informed me 'everyone loves working for Mr. Oberoi, its a great place to work'. You can certainly tell from the way they go about their business. Nothing is too much trouble. I have read other reports saying it is way too expensive etc however it is absolutely worth every penny, if you buy a Ferrari would you complain about the cost. Luxury comes at a price and this is worth it.

"We stayed in this beautiful resort for 3 nights. Let me start with the good:
1. the property is gorgeous; nice private beach and pool areas, beautifully maintained property.
2. the staff really tries very hard to please and delivers as expected
3. the food and service is very good; went to Sirena (seafood) and Rima (Italian) for dinner; lunch and drinks at the Alon Bar; and buffet breakfast in Vintana. Though dinners were very pricey, we were not disappointed.

The not-so-good:
1. We arrived before 11 am, so we are early. I do understand that the room is not ready and that check in is at 2 pm and I'm okay to wait until then. We hung around the Lobby Lounge for about an hour and then decided to go to Alon Bar to grab some lunch. At 2 pm, we went back to the lobby, but alas, the room is not ready-- we have to sit around some more and we will be notified when it's ready. This is not acceptable. We prepaid $$$$ months ago and the least that they can do is to have our room ready by check-in time. The guest relations rep is very accommodating after I complained and he was able to find me a wash up room so we can stretch out after 20 hours of travel. Our ""real"" room wasn't ready until 4 pm.
2. The deluxe seaview room has a beautiful view overlooking the beach. Love the view! It's a nice room, but nothing to write home about. The bathroom needs to be re-grouted as mold is starting to grow on the corners (by the soap holder).

Overall, we had a good stay. The staff is excellent, tries hard to please and gives the best service. Will I stay again? Maybe, but not likely.

"Nice setting, great service (especially if you stay in a villa which comes with a butler. Sunny was amazing) but it's such a shame to stay on this part of Boracay when the White Beach (the main beach of Boracay) is a million times nicer and that's what makes Boracay special.
The hotel itself here is very good. Perhaps even a little better than some of the other Shangri-la's I'd visited. Except the food. I stayed in the hotel for over a week and ate mostly within the hotel so I know I've given the hotel restaurants a fair chance.
Bottom line: a very nice hotel but I give it 'average' rating for 2 things: 1) very unimpressive beaches (there are 2) for Boracay standards 2) really disappointing food.
It's a bit of a pain to get to Boracay - you might as well stay on White Beach if you make the effort! That's what Boracay is all about, after all.",Food:Location:Value for money

The property is lovely, the service of each and every staff member is excellent, the room is really very comfortable and clean. The resort has shuttle bus running to ""D Mall"" every hour.. but honestly we didn't feel like leaving the property...
The kid's club is excellent... and the Spa is really very good... you get your own private villa for the treatment with personal bath etc... and I am pregnant, but the staff was qualified to give me the appropriate massage.
The NEGATIVE things we experienced this time:
1. Food; the quality of food and options were somehow not as impressive as the last time we were there. The menu was quite limited ( especially for in-room dining). Infact, one evening I was served ""penne in arrabiata sauce"" with loads of olives and vegetables??? also... one evening the food was actually without any seasoning and the salt given on table didn't have any salt in it.
2. Buffet; we opted for Asian buffet one evening, which was on the beach... the setting was lovely and the prices were obviously at par with luxurious hotel but when we started eating, it was disappointing to realise that all my vegetarian husband could eat was fried noodles, boiled vegetables and rice... which has never happened to us before... there are possibilities for 2-3 more options...
3. Toiletries; whenever we travel, i carry all my toiletries with me, except when we travel to Shangri-La as they provide Loccitane things.... but I was disappointed to not to find those things there... i would have carried my own things if I would have know that wouldn't be provided.

"Shang Boracay's resort surrounding is consistent with its design/theme in all its hotels/resorts. I enjoyed walking around the area and viewing the garden, the beach and pool. The function rooms have advanced facilities (projector and big screen, audio system, etc.) and superior interior design. I am awed with the band playing by the beach and pool side during an afternoon dip.
They can still improve the call handling skills of their guest services. They are so obedient with their spiels that they fail to capture the answer to their spiels as the guest relays the concern.
Boat trips for snorkelling takes 2 hours. Crew should plan to bring drinks and snacks since the trip can drive the guests hungry midway.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"If our stay had limited to only a weekend, I would have settled for an one star.

Where to start ?

On the day of the arrival, we were given a room (Family Premier seaview room). Opening the terrace door only to hear a glaring sound from the beach. The room is nothing to write home for. Looks more like a Ramada Inn than an exuberant luxury room (the room was spacious though, for us three).

Tthe hotel is a famous venue for roadshows, weddings etc. during weekends.

The front office assured us that the beach party will end at 10 pm (which it did) and assured us to shift at the end of the aisle, supposedly calm.

They offered us an Australian piquette (which we left half finished), for supporting the noise.

While waiting for the beach party to end, we descended to the Vintana restaurant for a dinner. We wanted to try the fancy Italian restaurant but my wife, tired from the trip from Pangalusian resort, decided not to change her flip flops.

The restaurant was not crowded even though the hotel was running full due to the weekend crowd.

Mistake we made, by trying the Vintana. The taste was so bad that we we were surprised that we were in a luxury hotel !

We ordered two glasses of wine. The girl served us a quarter glass each time.

Cha Gios were served without the Nuoc-mâm Sauce. The Ghobi from the Aloo Ghobi seemed to have been plucked from the ground and added directly to the dish.
So much for a hotel that boasts of its Asian heritage !!

The next day, we tried the beach and the pool. It was so crowded that we thought of going to the White Beach (Boracay town). There is a complimentary shuttle that goes every hour from the hotel to the White beach (D MALL). Another mistake.

As one reviewer said, there could a ""bun fight"" to catch the shuttle.

When we got down, from the shuttle, at the D MALL, my daughter was almost in tears. IT WAS NIGHTMARE. Greasy spoon hotels and restaurants, lined up next to each other. Stench of bad barbecue. Half naked euro trash window shopping while the Filipinos gape. Hell on earth. Not the paradise we looked for.

A lump in our throats. We had made a mistake of paying upfront our stay in ShangriLa. The much praised White Beach was unfrequentable. Shangri La was not better either.

After the weekend, things radically changed. The hotel became more quite. The two private beaches were less crowded and the hotel had a less stuffy atmosphere.

The rooms are not phonetically isolated. Depending on your neighbors, you can spend sleepless nights. Hearing our grievances, the Duty Managers took the time (we appreciated the gesture) to show us, the villas (garden and pool villas). Though spacious, we were not convinced because the villas lacked one fantastic thing that we had in our rooms : the beach view). We ended up staying in our Premier room sacrificing the tranquility over a wonderful view (the view was really fantastic). If the DMs had proposed a sea view Villa we would taken it sans hesitation.

The hotel on the plus side :
Beautiful two beaches. At Punga beach you do not have to wear the sandals.
The hotel is huge with nice gardens to walk through.
The staff is efficient (never was any of my calls un-returned).
Spa was good (my wife tried the 3day wellness program) in a nice setting.
Decent gym.
Tips: Do not forget the pre-departure laundry. In my opinion, one of the cheap deals you get from this costly hotel.
The transfer staff (ShangriLa to Boracay Airport) do a wonderful job of going the extra mile to see us board the plane).

On the minus side :
The rooms and the hotel seem drabby (specially on a rain day). Insipid decoration with no style (pseudo Afro ?). No flowers anywhere.
Two much crowd on weekends. Looks like more than a Holiday Inn than a luxury hotel.
Rooms are not well isolated.
Too pricey for what is worth (Philippines is not a costly country. We had a three hearty meal at a Manila Mcdonalds for less than 6 euros !).
Shuttle to White Beach. There are no taxis. The front desk calls for a tricycle. You have to nevertheless take a ShangriLa van to the front gate where the tricycle would wait for you. Too tedious. In short, you cannot leave the hotel whenever you please.
The food : sooooooooo bad.

Though White Beach is a stunningly beautiful beach during week days when it is not crowded, if you have the money to pay for ShangriLa I suggest you put your money in a much more tranquil luxurious layout considering the fact that Philippines is an outstandingly, beautiful country (Thailand without the crowd).

I do not regret ShangriLa Boracay but I have the bitter feeling that we paid more for more it was worth.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We stayed for 5 nights in a private pool villa at the Shangri-La Boracay. It was perfect. The villa was large and well appointed, and well-maintained for a 5-year-old property in the Philippines. The food was good and the security is exceptional. Special requests are met with a can-do attitude. Being Canadian, we wanted to watch the Winter Olympics gold medal men's hockey game, and the staff made it happen in the entertainment centre. Best of all the pool villa comes with a butler who answers every request with truly positive sincerity. There are plenty of water activities such as snorkeling, sailing and kayaking to keep you entertained, as well as sun and sand.",Location:Staff
"I do love the Shangri-la chain, as normally you know what to expect and normally they do deliver. But Boracay is at most 3 Star level. The Hotel is pretty run down, so everything is outworn and would have been changed a long time agao by any other Shangri-la (the beds are stone hard, the glass ceiling above our balcony was broken, the sofa had a wet smell, etc.) But they do have their own small beach, which is the only explanation to me why so many people still go there. If you have small kids, please do so. If not - please avoid at all costs. You won't be able to relax as the pool is very small, and the sun beds in the pool area as well as on the beach are somewhat close together.
Service is very friendly, but without any professionalism ( one example: due to technical problems of our flight we arrived 28 hours late, and were in constant contact with the Hotel to update them. When they picked us up at the boat they asked as: I hope you had a good journey - not what you want to hear after a terribel journey of which they were informed many times...). The food is way below average, but of course they charge the Standard Shangri-la rates. The Spa was the only up to standard feature, the massage we had was excellent. We decided to leave 3 days early as we so did not enjoy our stay there, but of course they did only give us a partial refund (as they made us pay the full room rate when booking). As we stay quite a lot in other Shangri-la Hotels we would have hoped for more.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"A the tip of Boracay, there is this sparkling new resort, which is worlds away from the famous (and too populous) long beach itself. The beach is clean, quiet and if you take one of the kayaks out around the corner, you get to a really deserted beach which is wonderful.

The room itself is impeccable, but I wonder how long it will last in this state as the fittings seem to be a bit ""economy"". Service is, as in many places in the Philippines, excellent, though the food is boring, as expected (chicken adobo, anyone?). A great hideaway with a beautiful beach and clear water full of tropical fish and corals. There is even a dive-school on-site, but as expected, it charges a premium price.",Value for money:Location:Food
"I cannot say enough amazing things about the Shangri-La! My husband and I got married here last month and the staff was truly incredible. We travel around the world, both for work and pleasure, often and this was some of the best service we have ever received. Everyone knew our name and knew we were getting married, which is always fun to be congratulated and reminded, but they also quickly knew our guests, parents and wedding party when they visited.

From the moment you arrive you are welcomed, whether or not you are staying there. Even if you aren't staying there I recommend going for a drink at Solana Bar or having dinner in one of their restaurants, the property is absolutely stunning! We stayed in a Treehouse Villa and the room was spectacular. It was extremely spacious, luxurious and incredibly well taken care of by the team and our butler. We had a girls' day at the spa, rehearsal drinks at Solana Bar, room service, and used the pool and everywhere we went the team was warm and professional.

The beach we had our ceremony at, and the Sagana Ballroom for our reception exceeded our expectations and photographed beautifully. The food was perfect and our guests raved about the whole experience there.

It was Chinese New Year so they were sold out, but the only complaint I would have is the amount of time it took to get a buggy/golf cart. Since the resort is so spacious it is needed and we often found ourselves waiting long periods and having to call a couple of times. Not a big deal though, and overall we were truly blown away by our week there and creating very special memories, thanks to the amazing staff and especially Abigail our planner!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We came here for a little family reunion with our 70+ year old parents and found paradise. From the facilities, the staff and the set-up of the resort, there is not much one could fault. The team was very friendly, the food was good and the resort and interior design outstanding. We will be back soon and will stay at this fine property any time.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Beautiful location but maintenance is far below the Shangri-La standard.

Staff very polite but quite inefficient. They acknowledge any request with a “yes” but that does not mean that they will deliver. Example (one of many) today at the pool: we were greeted by a charming pool man who said he would arrange seating for us. He walked away but never returned.

When we arrived we were told about dining options. We opted for the buffet of the same evening and said so to the staff. When we showed up a few hours later were told that it was fully booked. Thanks to a very helpful receptionist and after showing our frustration they finally added a table. When we got down to the buffet area at the beach we noticed that adding a table was no issue – lots of space and lots of (tasty!) food.
We did have a fantastic massage by the pool. Ask for Ms. Jeanja she is the BEST.

"Loved Shangri La - utterly! It's the diamond of the island that's for sure. Loved the Filipino people and their hospitality and everything we accessed, our room, the food, the buggy rides, the pick up and drop off, the walking through to checkin and waiting with us, EVERYTHING! You must go see this place",Location:Staff:Food
"We have been staying at the Shangri-la over the Chinese New Year. It is a long journey to get there, especially traveling with children. (flight, 1 1/2 hours bus ride, boat transfer) We booked 2 rooms with connecting doors as we always do traveling with our 3 kids. Connecting doors were confirmed to our travel agent, at check-in and on the way to the room. When we arrived there at 8pm there was no connecting door and also no help from the staff. The hotel was fully booked and the staff basically said we were lucky we have rooms next to each other and gave us the legal speech. Very disappointing start. We payed for 2 rooms and had to share with our children as we could not leave them by themselves in the next room.
Having stayed at other Shangri-la's in the world we expected the facilities to be as they were: exclusive and relaxing. We also expected a high standard service. All the staff is very friendly and helpful, but execution is very slow and orders got forgotten several times. 90% of Asia's 5 star hotel have fantastic facilities but what makes or breaks a hotel for us is the service. From a top hotel I expect excellent service throughout. We like to thank Jaquelin from the the restaurant booking service and Gee our housekeeper for their outstanding services, but apart from these two ladies service was below any other Shangri-la we have stayed before. A shame as the resort itself is a beautiful resort with stunning private beaches.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Spent 4 nights at this property. The resort is pristine with two sandy beaches to choose from. The breakfast buffet is one of the best I have had. The choices were expensive and the staff was abundant and attentive. We had a sea view room and it was well appointed with lots of room and a nice balcony. The entire resort has excellent Wi-Fi. The spa services were excellent and reasonably priced. The pool was expansive but we felt too “closed” in and close to other guests. We preferred the larger of the 2 beaches for more privacy. We loved the Rima treetop restaurant and lobby bar area. We did not find the service at the pool bar or pool dining area to be first rate, such a shame because all other services were top notch.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"From the minute we arrived on the quayside in Caticlan until the moment we left, we were treated like royalty in Shangri-La's Borocay resort. Whisked by speedboat along the coast of the island to the private beach of the resort and welcomed by friendly smiling staff. The resort is beautiful, private beaches, lush gardens, multi-level restaurants and bars. They have it all right.
Except - the service, while friendly and smiling fell short of the mark of a five-star hotel. On several days, our room had not been made up by 3pm in the afternoon, service at the beach bar was slow, and the information about our check-out time was wrong. The service in the restaurants, - we ate in RIma, Sireno and Cielo, was good but the food was only adequate.
Still, a stunning location and a wonderful break over Chinese New Year, which meant the hotel was very busy - perhaps the reason for the slow service.",Staff:Food:Location
"Generally, I do not understand some of the complaints people had. To me, Shangri-la has to be the best in Boracay(I didn't stay in any other hotels here, but I looked at some of the better ones from outside). It is away from the crowded white beach, but its private beach is still very breath-takingly beautiful. It is so private, that I don't even have to go deep into the ocean and I could just float around in the shallow water and be able to see colorful fish! It was truly addictive.

The facility of course is top class. The architecture is just beautiful. The gym is spacey and well-equiped. The service is superb (sometimes a little bit too warm). Ever since the pick-up from Caticlan airport, you can stop wonder around like an idiot. Check-in and Check-out was one-on-one, easy, flawless, comfortable, fast. Room has fresh fruits an fresh ice cubes everyday. The pool, the beach gives you bottled water for hydration(no extra charge). Have to mention their wifi-no need to put in password and you can log in as many devices as you want at the same time, no matter you are on the beach or by the pool, of course also in your room, with really good internet speed. Breakfast has a big variety of select, with fresh quality food. Service at breakfast was specially good, those guys/gals are always on top of EVERYTHING. The shuttle goes to the D-mall is not too frequent, it just means you do have to manage your time better according to shuttle schedule. In general, it was quite convenient to go to the busy beach or come back to the peaceful heaven.

If you ask me if I would save money by staying in an OK 200$/night hotel or Shangri-la, I'd totally choose Shangri-la again. That's what a vacation needs, is an escape from any hassle. Shangri-la does it all for you.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Internet

"I chose this resort over discovery shores for 2 reasons - their online booking facility is user-friendly and my sister is a global member. Despite the assurance given to me that my sister will get the points for our stay which later was redacted, they awarded the points instead to me as they convince me to become a member. That being said, their service from our arrival to departure is extremely impressive. The welcome greeting and orientation by Pauline was excellent and quite helpful. Their concierge Alvaro was most helpful and is always available to us when we required. The facilities are excellent. Their staff and services offered are the best features of this resort. I highly recommend this hotel. It may be a bit costly but as to my experience, it is worth every dollar and more. You can never know how good this hotel is until you try it at least once. PS.

"I've had the privilege of staying in a number of beach resorts, yet the Shangri-La Boracay absolutely smashes the competition. This was without doubt the best resort experience ever of my life - from beginning to end, we received VIP treatment and every part of our stay was executed with perfection, with the highlights being:

Arrival, transfer and check-in
We flew into Caticlan airport and as you enter the arrivals area, the hotel's representatives in their well-recognisable beige and red uniforms are already there to welcome you and assist with administration (you need to fill out a personal registration form) as well as collection of your luggage (in fact, we didn't see our bags until we had already checked into our room.) We were then whisked away via air-conditioned carrier to the hotel's exclusive lounge at the pier, and served cold towels and drinks as we waited for other passengers from another flight. The speedboat transfer to the resort took about 20 minutes, and upon arrival, another team with golf buggies greeted and chauffeured us to reception for check-in.

Rooms and breakfast at Vintana
For our 5-night accommodation, we stayed in a sea view room which was very spacious, and beautifully and immacuately appointed, providing ample storage facilities. And for breakfast, we were overwhelmed by the buffet selection at Vintana restaurant - from your typical full English or Continental breakfast, to Filipino, Japanese and Asian food, as well as a noodle station, a pancake station, an omellette station, a fruit station, a dessert and ice cream station and last but not least, an enormous pastry hall with one side housing at least a 5-meter long table with freshly-baked bread and pastries, and on the other side a selection of jams and marmalade blended from your ""normal"" fruits as well as a variety of other exotic and local fruits.

Beach and facilities
The hotel has both a private and semi-private beach area, where a wonderful and hard-working staff of lifeguards, waiters and assistants look after your well-being. You will always encounter fellow guests who are ever so demanding, and we would regularly see the beach staff go out of their way to carry stacks of heavy beach chairs back and forth so that the spot where these guests can lie in the sun is just so perfect. The waiters will supply with you chilled bottled water, regularly check on you to take any orders and simply do whatever is necessary to make you happy. And contrary to what other reviewers have commented, we never had to wait much longer than 15-20 minutes for our orders to arrive.

We regularly used the gym, which is enormous and well-equipped, and the changing rooms each have sauna, steam and jacuzzi. Likewise, we had a few games of ""whiff-whaff"" in the entertainment room, which also has pool tables, video and arcade games and internet browsing stations. I also went for an ""Indulgence of Time"" at the Chi Spa. I was collected from our room and driven by buggy to the spa, where I was escorted by my assigned therapist to one of its 11 dedicated spa areas, housing a changing room with a steam shower on the one side, and a separate treatment room on the other. The treatment was pure bliss, and afterwards, I felt as if I were levitating in air.

Food
Following our daily sumptuous breakfast, and not being big eaters generally, we only had a light snack and drinks at the beach during the day and mostly ate dinner Sirena. The food, the service, the views and the ambience were just amazing.

Check-out and departure
Given our flight was late afternoon, we requested and were allowed a late check out. Taking the speedboat back to the airport and passing through the sights of the islands brought tears to my eyes. At the airport, the Shangri-La staff were again there to support us the entire time, from ensuing we got on the right queue, taking care of our luggage, speaking to the airline representatives all the way to escorting us to the security gate.

Even as I write this review, I am reminded of what a fantastic time I had at the Shangri-La. What makes this resort really stand out is that it combines the best of worlds - a modern, state-of-the art facility with all the comfort and amenities, a breathtaking location, and most of all, the friendliest, hard-working and most dedicated staff that will do whatever it takes to ensure your stay is perfect.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"My family stayed at the Shangri-La from December 24 to 27th. We truly had a great experience from when we were picked up at Kalibo airport exhausted from a 24 hr flight to when we left to another hotel which was poor compared to the Shangri-La's. The kids activity centre really made my children's stay very enjoyable and they still talk about the experiences with Nina and the staff. The entertainment room was a good break in the evenings for some family tine. The resort overall was fabulous but my worst experience was with the Rima I was very disappointed we went for dinner on Christmas Day the food was average and over priced!!! I don't how it made a list of fine dinning the service at beginning was fine but then after our meal they ignored us and took 30 minutes to get our bill!! I feel as per other reviews they need to they need to change their menu. The kids menu had no variety and for dinner we found nothing to our likings . Overall we had a great experience the staff was kind and knew my children's by name but the women all dressed alike and not knowing the Island when we asked questions was a concern the staff should be able to inform guests about the Island not only about the resort itself . I know when we were there the resort was full to capacity but did not feel that way to us. I would recommend this resort to families it quite, the rooms were nice but the shower does need some upgrades , we did have a tub which the kids loved. The grounds are large you can lay near the beach on a hammock with the kids running on the grass. I would go again not over such a busy time and would get a room on the 5th floor for a ocean view, we had a deluxe suite but on the 3rd floor.",Food:Staff
"We stayed here for few nights during our vacation in Boracay and was great hotel.
Breakfast was very good and room was clean and beautiful with view of ocean.
They have a very beautiful private beach we watched the best sunset of our life, it was truly amazing. You can see from my pictures as well.

I personally am not into very big hotels as i prefer more private boutique hotels but this one was exception.
We had such great time as they had everything onsite.
Anything you need, you can get it there.

If you have kids i would strongly recommend staying here as they have kids play ground that they can play air hockey, basketball shooting game, billiards, ping pong etc etc great entertainment facility for free.

I had hot stone massage which was quite expensive for Boracay but was just ok.

Stuff were nice but not very informative.
We asked how to get to the crystal cave and they did not know how.
one person told us its about hour and half and we must take a boat there and another stuff told us its just quick tricycle ride.

We did not go because we were unsure.

"Just returned from a family holiday at Shangri-La's Boracay Resort and Spa. We had a 2 bedroom villa which was very spacious and extremely well appointed and comes complete with a beautiful sun terrace with pool. It was both secluded and quiet. I must say that I cannot fault this resort. The beaches are exactly what you would expect from the Philippines with white sand and turquoise sea. F&B throughout the resort was fine and not over priced. There is also a good dive centre that caters for scuba, snorkelling and boat trips. Above all we found the service to be impeccable at every level. This is a very well run and managed resort. Getting there can be a chore as it is served by 2 inefficient domestic airports. My advice is to arrange for Shangri-La to transfer you from the international terminal to the domestic terminal at Manila if you have a terminal change otherwise be prepared for a long and difficult ride.",Comfort & Facilities:Location

Boracay is a bit wild, with crazy electric cables in the streets, but the Island is beautiful, and Shangri-La is not Boracay. It is a little slice of Heaven. Great Kids Club, great location with white beaches, great food and then great service. It sees a very diverse mix of nationalities, with more Russians over the New Year - but these were well behaved ones - with Chinese starting to arrive for their New Year as we were leaving. Santa turned up on Christmas eve, and the staff put on a nativity play. The fireworks and free Tattinger went down well on New Year's eve. Not cheap, but definitely worth the money.

"The hotel is nice, we had a standard room which had a very nice bathroom and a large balcony directly over the beach. When there are private functions on the beach it is noisy, often with loud music. but that didnt bother us.

The biggest problem we had was with the food, it was way below standard and not what we expected. I agree with a previous reviewer that it is ridiculous to call Rima (Italian Restaurant) fine dining, as it certainly isn't. Its a nice location set high in the trees and with a cosy atmosphere, unfortunately I had to send my main course back twice, the lamb was raw and after a 20 minute wait, during which time my husband finished his meal, i was given something that was so overlooked I couldn't even cut it. I gave up and went without ... The manager tried to placate me with a free glass of wine and a dessert (of his choice!)

It didnt end here, the following evening we ate in the fish restaurant (Sirena) the food was ok but we had amazing service as the food and beveridge director personally came and spoke to us following our previous complaint. We felt better about the situation and thought we had been unlucky so far.

On New Years Eve the beach party was cancelled as the weather was wet so we managed to secure a table in the fish restaurant as we decided this was the safest bet. Wrong Decision! We chose the 5 course Lobster menu which was the special menu for the evening. It was awful. The lobster was tasteless and poorly cooked, it was poorly presented and the service didnt resemble anything like the service we had the previous evening. We didnt complain, we were tired of that. We just decided never to return.

Its worth mentioning that the Spa was pretty poor too. We had a couples massage, we were both asked for our preferences. These were then totally ignored and we got a standard off the shelf massage. This was not professionally done as the pressure was inconsistent, varying from non existent to painful! I read another reviewer comments that they begged for paper underwear, after asking I was just told 'keep your own underwear on or take it off!' I made a complaint about the whole experience but it was never followed up.

This is an expensive hotel and not with the money! Borocay town is a dump! There is a bun fight to get the shuttle bus back from DMall as there are never enough seats. My advice is dont bother going into town.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"We paid a large sum in March 2014 to have the Villa on the beach as well as rooms for 25 guests from overseas, and were not given the Villa because another guest had checked in before we did.

I also work in hospitality and the best response generally should be along the lines of ""I apologise for the confusion, there isn't much I can do now, however I will try to make up for this by....."" This was not the response we got from the Villa Manager. This was the second time we've been to Shangrila Boracay, because the first time we had an amazing experience.

"My husband and I stayed at the Shangri-La with our 3 daughters (aged 4, 6 & 8) for the week before Christmas. We had a lovely stay. We were in a family suite and found it comfortable. We honestly were not in it very much as we spent our time enjoying the resort. The staff are truly friendly and helpful. The waiters and guys working around the pool/beach were so accommodating and hard-working. The pool is lovely and we didn't have any trouble getting chairs whenever we went down, but I can see how it might be difficult when the hotel is full. We enjoyed both beaches. Our daughters enjoyed snorkeling and looking at the fish and coral. They had fun in the sand, and we had nice walks along it as well. We rented a kayak for an hour and my family enjoyed that. Quite honestly, I think that non-motorized leisure equipment should be available at no charge at the Shangri-La. I can't say enough about the lovely people working in the Kids' Club. We had trouble getting our girls to leave! They enjoyed the activities and the slides. It was a nice reprieve for them when they needed a break from the heat and sun. I understood the need for socks in the Kids' club, but didn't quite understand the rule about wearing long sleeves on the slides. As a very well-traveled person who has stayed at every possible star rating of hotel from the Ritz-Carlton to hostels, I honestly don't understand the complaints about the breakfast at the Shangri-La. They have everything covering Western tastes, Asian fare, vegetarian options, healthy food, not-so-healthy food (ice-cream!!). It was all presented tastefully and all of the staff were friendly and accommodating. Our whole family left the breakfast feeling full and satisfied on all 7 days that we were there. The food at the other restaurants was also good. Some items seemed expensive (and I live in Singapore where eating out always requires a bank loan!) but, when I consider the location of the hotel and the process it must take to get fresh food items out there, I guess I can understand it. Our family tried the Grill night out on the beach one evening, and we enjoyed that. The hotel is isolated and, after going in to D'Mall and walking along White Beach, we appreciated it. The hotel location would not be suitable for people who are looking to be in the midst of hustle and bustle, but we loved the quiet tranquility. It is a bit of a process getting to Boracay itself. We had a direct flight to Kalibo, and had the hotel arranged our transfer to the island/hotel. We are very thankful that we did this as it was very convenient, and our driver was friendly and helpful. It took us 2 hours to get from the airport to the boat jetty. Luckily our girls handled it well enough but, this could be a long drive with younger kids. The private boat jetty was a lovely little touch, and the 20 minute speed-boat ride to the hotel was quick and easy. The awaiting staff and cart whisked us away to our room and the check-in process completed in our room was quick and convenient. We arranged for the transfer back to Kalibo on our way home as well. Although we had to wait for the boat and our van for a bit, we made it to the airport in 1.5 hours (drive time). We weren't expecting the Shangi-La staff member to be waiting for us at the airport and it was such a nice convenience to have him there. He helped us navigate the chaos of the Kalibo airport departure area. He stayed with us through the lines, check-in (at which he helped us get convenient seats on the plane) and immigration. Overall, we all left feeling relaxed, spoiled and happy.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed in late November for a week. We were very worried that there would be damage from the typhoon but there was no sign of any damage at all, even to the trees surrounding the resort.

We stayed in a one bedroom loft villa. It had spectacular views, privacy and a good layout with the bedroom up top and the living area downstairs with the pool and outdoor area. Although the rooms are not new, they are well maintained and we felt like we were in a perfect island paradise. The only thing we would have liked was alcohol in the minibar - it was a bit of a task to order every drink from room service. Potentially though, we couldn't find it as the kitchen was huge.

We had a private beach dinner to celebrate our anniversary, the staff were amazing and presented us with a personalised cake. I'd absolutely recommend doing it if you stay. We also dined at Sirena and Rima. Rima was our favourite with lovely italian food. An absolute must!

The spa was closed for renovations but a gorgeous villa was being used instead and we didn't notice any difference in service.

The breakfast buffet is generous and includes absolutely everything you could want.

We loved our stay and hope to go back. The service was attentive and polite, we felt the staff couldn't do enough for us. The worst part about the resort is getting there, it is an experience and as others have commented, transiting through Manila and Caticlan is certainly an eye opener.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"By sharing that we have visited many luxurious resorts already in our life on many countries, this one was one of the best. Location, respect of privacy, level of hospitality, quality of restaurant, all was outstanding. Especially the main restaurant Rima, and the breakfast buffet was amazing... By considering the disadvantage by locating in an island, it is remarkable to be able to provide such variety of menu every day. We stayed in the sea suite, room was big enough, amenity was fantastic, terrace with day bed & bubble bathtub was of course perfect for us. Though the access is not easy, flights usually delays for several hours, it is worth to stretch legs to go there.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at the Shangri-La Boracay resort and spa on December 2013 for 6 days and stayed at their luxury Villa 13. This resort is absolutely magnificent and the location is private so you're not part of the busy crowd. We were able to relax and take in the beautiful views of the Island. You can do everything in the resort - they have an activities office where you can book jet skis, island hopping, scuba diving, para sailing etc. Any water activities you want to do they can organise for you and you don't have to leave the resort.
Our Villa 13 was so beautiful and very clean. We had a Butler called Alex who was just an absolute help in whatever we needed done. We were given a mobile phone so if we were away from the resort or if we wanted to contact Alex we just dialled his number and he was ready to help us.
The staff at the resort are so friendly and very helpful. I have never in my life experience such a wonderful staff and we have stayed in a lot of luxury resorts/hotels.
All in all, I would highly recommend staying at this resort. You will never regret it and the money is worth every penny spent.",Staff:Location:Value for money
"This is the excellent place for a holidays. Very well desgined, beautiful area, comfortable rooms & villas, great service. There is only two things which could be better:
- rooms we had 5th flor - we could hear people living above us - as they weak up early we had to also :(
- food - is good in main restaurant but not very good - maybe they try to have too many types from internation cuisine as a result TomYum had only name from real thai, Laksa were jsut spicy and nothing more and pasta's had nothing to do with those in normal Italina restaurant
Other restaurant were very good - not excellent.

All others great, spa , swimming pool, private barbecue - just excellent",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We've stayed at this resort in 2010 and 2011. We had great experiences back then. For this year, it wasn't as good. Service has certainly changed. We're disappointed. It seems like the staff doesn't know what they're doing or they're not as experienced.
Anyway, we were there for a wedding. We still had a great time despite the little short-comings of the staff.
Some of the decors on the pool has deteriorated.",Staff

"This review is a bit late - we stayed in May 2012 with our two children (3 and 1). We stayed for 3 nights at the end of our holiday in Boracay. We had stayed the first part of our holiday at another resort in White Beach. The Shangri-la is fabulous. The entry is beautiful and the views are wonderful. We had a deluxe seaview room that had ample room with the king bed, a sofa bed for our toddler and a portacot for our 1 year old. The bathroom was huge, the balcony had a great outlook over the gardens, over the pool to the ocean (the room is exactly what you see in the photo on their website). The service was amazing. You are greeted with a friendly hello everywhere. Great service by the pool. There are many places to eat, the buffet was great. They have a free shuttle down to White Beach, so you aren't that far away from the action. After staying down in White Beach for the first part of our holiday, we were happy to stay and use the resorts facilities. The private beach is not as nice as White Beach, but still quite good. We spent most of our time at the pool. The kids club is great. You can pamper yourself with manicures and pedicures, use the CHI spa, it is all here. You will not be disappointed. The speed boat service back to Caticlan is fantastic. We did not get this on the way in as we stayed elsewhere first up. But it beats going through the busy road! Worth the money. Places like this would be far more expensive in Australia!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of November as part of a wedding party, and I can't recommend it enough (if you have that kind of spare change available--we could not have afforded to stay here for that long at full price). The view from our room was stunning, and service was impeccable: everyone was so friendly and helpful! Some of the highlights of our stay:
- breakfast buffet (included in price) is jaw dropping: go hungry
- best mojito I have ever had
- there's a happy hour every day from 5 to 7, and cocktails and draft beer are 2 for 1
- the band performing by the pool during the happy hour takes requests
- there are free activities planned each day: we did the kayaking on Sunday afternoon, and it was fantastic (do not do it if you are hung over or get sea sick)
- we flew into Kalibo (which I would not do again: fly into Caticlan) and had the hotel transfer service to and from the airport, and while spendy, it was worth it: everyone gets their own private van, which is very comfortable and comes with cold water, and you had an attendant to help with luggage both when arriving at the airport AND when departing (such a luxury to have help with the check in!)
- we had dinner at Rima on our last night, and it was delicious and a good value (by Los Angeles standards, anyway): highly recommend

Things to look out for:
- do not order a mimosa at breakfast: they cost USD$20.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"We had an amazing experience with Shangri-La Boracay Resort. The Loft Villa is highly recommended. You don't have to go out to downtown. Everything is there. The view, the nice Infiniti pool, the fantastic service by your own butler what else you could ask for? My Husband and I felt like we're home. We even had a Christmas Tree at the leaving room before the lobby has :). The dinner at beach was amazing. It is quite expensive but it's something intimate and perfect for honeymooners.

Would visit Shangri-La again. Hopefully soon.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Guests feel pampered and completely looked after from the moment they step into the airport to the moment they get into the departure lounge. Every member of the staff greets you with a smile and a genuine offer of assistance. I Even though i don't like Boracay, I would go back just for this Shangri-La's service anytime.",Staff
"I based my choice on other trip advisor reviews and I do not regret having chosen to stay at Shangri-La in Boracay. The facilities are outstanding and the private beach is idyllic. I went in late November 2013 (a few weeks after typhoon Haiyan hit) and at times my boyfriend and I had the beach and pool almost to ourselves.

The dining is top-notch and quite reasonably priced for the quality. There is also a good selection of free activities throughout the week so you don't have to leave the hotel at all if you don't want to.

On my last day I took the free shuttle to the ""downtown"" area of Boracay and was surprised at the poverty level of the island. That left me feeling a bit depressed, to be honest, and definitely put our luxurious getaway into perspective.",Value for money:Location
"Stayed here on my recent trip to Boracay with a few friends.

I've stayed at a few other hotels in station 2. However this hotel is on a different level. If you're looking for a quiet, relaxing resort, this is definitely something you should consider.

Beautiful grounds, and hotel. Great views and very well kept.

Breakfast is great also - lots of selection.

Be sure to book spa treatments in advance as my friends and I missed out.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
This is the best hotel resort I have ever stayed in! Value for money. Wish we could stay longer. We are planning to go back there again! We flew in from Manila to Caticlan. The only minor flaw I can think of is the 45 minute wait for the speedboat to pick us up from the airport lounge to take us to Shangri la. Another minor drawback is that there is only one beautiful pool. The pool at the CHI is for the exclusive use of the hose who have reservations at the spa. I recommend this for couples and families.,Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We stayed for my 50th at this beautiful resort, and it met all of my expectations.
Arrival: I was led to believe from other reviews that on arrival at Caticlan Jetty, you're led to the boat lounge while your boat is ready for departure, then on a private speedboat to the private jetty of Shangri-La, while sipping champagne. Most of that is true, and the representatives wearnng red at the airport, quick van ride to the Shangri-La Welcome Centre (""waiting lounge"") at the Jetty (with refreshing drink, cold towel on arrival), then onto the hotel's boat. It's not a luxury speedboat, and there is no further drink provided, but instead with another 15 or so people wearing life jackets for the 20min drive to Shangri-La. about 5 or so reps are there to meet you on arrival, all warmly greeting you, then taking you by buggy up to the reception area for checkin. We ended up catching an earlier flight from Manila, so arrived 1 hour earlier than planned. Hotel reps were there, no problem!

During: We stayed in Loft Villa 24 -- amazing views. Lucel, our butler, was amazing! Anything you need, you just call on the mobile phone provided for you with direct line access to the day butler (Lucel) and there's also an evening butler to 11pm (although we didn't use his service during our stay). On arrival in our room, we were presented with a fresh bowl of complimentary fruit and a nice bottle of wine with a welcome letter. The 2-storey loft villa with private pool has the most amazing views! With the humidity and heat, it was great to have the private pool! If you get the chance, make sure you go to Solana Bar in the resort! Nicholson and Nathaniel work there, and will give you the most amazing service! Very friendly and genuinely interested to talk to you and learn more about you and your trip and happy to give you advice on the island and the Philippines!
On my birthday, I was surprised with a BBQ dinner in Specialty Villa 13 with Private Chef (Marvin), Waiter (Sean) with tons of food. If you avail yourself of the Private Beach or Villa BBQ, some advice -- do NOT eat any lunch that day, or you'll be disappointed! There's so much food, you need room for it all! I was surprised at the end of the dinner with a whole bunch of staff greeting me with balloons, singing happy birthday and presented with a b'day cake and candles. Super nice that they all buggy'd their way to sing for me! ;-)

Departure: We were staying on the island, so didn't need to avail ourselves of the return speedboat transfer, so instead the hotel offered us a hotel private van direct to our next hotel! Now that's service!

Overall, an amazing experience! And, you don't need to leave the resort at all. However, if you do take the complimentary shuttle do D'Mall, you'll notice the *striking* contrast of the life outside the Shangri-La compared to the manicured gardens and surroundings within! A completely different experience. And always recommended to stay some time at Shangri-La, then go to another resort and experience the comparison! It'll give you a more rounded experience of Boracay!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Definitely one of the better resort in the island, if not the best.. From our arrival at Caticlan airport, to our transfer to the hotel, we were greeted with mindful and friendly staff, til the day we left Boracay. Our thanks indeed, to all the staff who made our stay a very memorable one. We stayed for 7 days and each day was just as beautiful and fun, as the next.. And though we were caught in between the Typhoon that hit the country, we were definitely aware, that the hotel did their best to protect us and gave us all the possible comfort thereafter. Thanks to Jun whom I really played a good game of tennis with, to Reysie whose sweet and genuine smile seemed to always brighten the day, and Friendel who was always eager to help us on the beach, and guide us with new tips, for the daily programs reserved for the day for hotel guest, and to John, from house keeping, who was always kind and patient in trying to clean our room everyday.. I still savor the thought of staying at Shangrila, and can't wait to be back..",Staff:Food
"Before I went to this hotel I stayed at the White Beach. It's no comparison at all. This resort is huge and offers everything you could think of. Beautiful rooms, nice dining options, two fantastic private beaches, beautiful swimming pools, great SPA, nice fitness center and an entertainment center with ping pong, billards and other games. The resort is very refined. A perfect retreat to unwind and enjoy the natural beauty Boracay is offering.

Also, if you still want to dive into the busting night life you can take the free shuttle service going to Boracay's dmall at the White Beach.

Another great thing is that they have their own reception desk in caticlan. So if you arrive with the airplane the transport with their private boat is included. That's a great start of the overall resort experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed at the resort for one night to be a presenter at ICCP Senior Management Business Conference. Because of the Yolanda Typhoon air traffic problems, my flight was diverted and I spent over an hour on the bus before arriving at the transit point to catch the speedboat. I was warmly welcomed both on arrival at the airport, where I was ushered to the bus and then at the transit point. My arrival at 11pm at the resort was handled smoothly by both the young lady receptionist and the concierge. In the morning the reception and concierge handled the changing of my flights back to Manila smoothly and was able to leave the resort at 12.30pm to catch the 1.30 flight back to Manila.

"Upside:
1) Beautiful place, great beach & pool
2) Staff - all friendly and kind
3) Buggy service- quick
4) Food at Buffet - wide selection and delicious
5) Requested for Room Change - Wish granted on Day 2 (now, this is TRULY a seaview room)

Downside
1) Ordered dinner via Room Service- it was too salty
2) Ordered breakfast via Room Service- Sent the an incomplete meal. Chef has forgotten to add the MAIN viands: sausages and bacon!
3) Purchased a seaview room 5 months earlier - (we were given Room 506) and you can hardly see the sea! They should call it ""Coconut View Room""
4) Ordered an extra bottle of L'Occitane Conditioner from Housekeeping (because i have very long hair) and the housekeeper says ""Sorry, the L'Occitane has been phased out). But guess what, the night before - another Housekeeper was able to supply our room with it. When I pointed this out, Sonny says ""Ah yes... Sorry Ma'am. Here it is - 3 bottles""
5) Booked a table at Shangri La's Rima restaurant - they told us it is very romantic there! perfect for a dinner date. To our dismay, the place had a lot of crying kids. There were couples beside us, dressed to the nines too - annoyed like us. The Manager, though sweet & apologetic - could have handled the situation better (by asking one of the parents to calm their kid outside the restaurant)
6) Shangri-La's Alon Restaurant/ Bar - ordered for Fish N' Chips at 6pm. One and a half hour later - Chicken wings arrived. Had to wait again for the correct meal to arrive
7) Shangri-La's Alon Restaurant/ Bar- there's a list of beers on the menu. But only San Mig light is available. (The bars in Boracay Station 1-3 would have definitely have a wider selection!)
8) Ordered for a Mojito on Day 1 - Bartender says ""we have it but we don't have MINT""
9) Ordered for a Mojito on Day 2 - Bartender says ""we have it, but we still don't have MINT""
10) Ordered for a Mojito on Day 3 - Bartender says ""we don't have MINT"" (C'mon F&B Team: there's a shuttle that goes to the main land every thirty minutes - couldn't someone restock your mint?)",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"My wife and I have just spent 7 nights in the Shangri-La Boracay. We stayed during typhoon Yolanda and I can not praise the staff and hotel management high enough. Safety was their priority and all guests were regularly informed (by letter and calls) of the weather and the day the Typhoon came we were confined to our rooms and given food and drinks for the evening. The following day the staff went about their duties as if nothing had happened. On top of this - the following day was our wedding and they went all out to make it a truly memorable experience.

Mr Amit who was the General Manager came to see us during our wedding day and on our departure and I personally praised a number of staff - Lara from guest service, Alex our butler, Reynaldo and Abigail from events. All of them were excellent - nothing ever too much trouble.

We stayed in three different rooms during our stay - Tree House Villa number 32 which was nice and private, Pool Villa 19 for the wedding (so my wife could walk out of the villa directly onto the Alon Garden for the ceremony) and Sea View Suite 345 during the Typhoon which offers excellent views of the beach and sea.

It was amazing that the hotel moved all villa guests into the main hotel for their safety. The hotel was secured well. With all main building windows being braced and hammocks etc all removed well in advance of the typhoon.

The transfers to and from the hotel were exceptionally well handled and the staff in the welcome centre were polite, attentive and eager to please.

The courtesy was also extended to our wedding guests who were offered use of the Shangri-La boat service to ensure they made the wedding while there was chaos at the Caticlan boat terminal. Again - above and beyond the call.

They also help in transfers to both Caticlan and Kalibo airports - in fact the service was so good even my father in law was impressed.

Would we stay there again? Yes in a heartbeat and we are already planning our next visit. I would recommend the regular rooms on floor 5 and 6 with a number higher than 520 or 620 for dramatic coast line views. I would recommend the tree house villas for those seeking a romantic or private getaway and the pool villas for those wanting to entertain or with kids. You can't go wrong.

Sure it is not the cheapest place - but you sure do get what you pay for. Excellent facilities - the gym was great and well equipped, an excellent kids adventure zone and a fun entertainment for adults. Couple this with a wide variety of daily activities and water sports and you can have a fun filled or relaxed time.

Also the buffet breakfast is outstanding - a real highlight every morning. We loved the yogurt station in particular. As the locals would say ""Masarap"" delicious!

If you are considering getting married their or having some other function again I wouldn't hesitate. The Shangri-La will deliver. Amit and his team have got customer service down to a fine art and set the standard others will need to ollow",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

This resort is everything you need.
a lot of entertainment from golf to kids play house.
if you have kids its paradise for them as they have pool tables , table ice hockey game, basketball shooting game, ping pong etc all you can enjoy entertainment at no cost. we really enjoyed it even as adults.

beautiful pool and pool bar, they have happy hour starting 5pm and drink prices are totally reasonable for 5 star hotel.
sunset at the beach is really amazing, the most beautiful sunset i have ever seen. sky color turn from blue to yellow to orange then purple. definitely recommend seeing sunset with some cocktails at the beach chair. live music was playing in the background and was very romantic as well.

rooms are beautiful we had ocean view room and view was amazing from the room. had balcony with nice outside lounge chair. bed is so comfortable. breakfast is buffet style by the lobby and it was very good. everything was fresh and many choice.

they have amazing gym facility for work out. top brand machines with spaced gym. very good. they even had clinic in case something happen to you.

i also went to their spa Chi and had hot stone treatment for 1.45hr. price is very high compared to other spas around in Philippines and i did not feel like i had something so special after treatment so i recommend you go Mandala spa where you can get more for about same price and its very beautiful with great services.

but overall amazing hotel, you never have to leave the hotel and if you do want to discover Dmall or center by white beach, they have free shuttle every hour until 1am to take you there.

They had their own water purification plant onsite and so you never worried about the water, ice cubes, or veggies. This was an oasis. The people were kind and friendly and most spoke good English. The food, typical for a Shangri-La, was great but the waiters for lunch and dinner were a bit slow & were slow with bringing wine/other beverages and the food/bill.

The shuttle was great and although the town was fun for shopping - the resort itself was lovely. There were two weddings while we were there. Both groups were pleased overall (with a few things that they worked out - but both said they'd have their weddings their again).

There were several standout employees - who went above and beyond and clearly provided a higher level of service. These were their true jewels. Overall a lovely experience.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We just got back from a stay at the Shangri-La in Boracay. I can not express adequately just how superb this resort was. This is the first time our departure day came and I did NOT want to leave. The staff was so sweet and were there to make sure everything was perfect for us. THe amazing service from the checkin where a lovely lady (sorry, I can't remember your name) whisked us off to the room to do our check in. After the long day of getting there from Malaysia (two air flights and then the hotels boat service to the resort) it was a pleasant surprise to be escorted straight to our room upon arrival. The resort is beautiful and the beach was the best we've stayed on in our year and 1/2 living in Malaysia. The sand was white, the water blue and it was swimmable! (we've been to some resorts in Bali and Malaysia that the water was too shallow to swim). They provide snorkel and fins for you to snorkel off the beach. The beach guys were attentive and friendly.

I have to also give a two thumbs up for the dive shop (Scotty's Dive shop). We ended up doing a Scuba course for 2 1/2 days and the instructor, Dave, was great. The dives were great as well and we all passed and received certification! We can not wait to go back! :)

Oh I should also add that the breakfast was amazing! Great variety of food, Asian to Western, 2 egg stations so never a line, great pastries, and my husband looked forward to the ""croissant waitress"" coming by our table just when we thought we were through to tempt us with a warm croissant! After the first day there the waiters knew to bring us ketchup and Tabasco for our omelets and kept our coffee pot filled with fresh coffee! And everyone says hello to you while you walk into the restaurant. We enjoyed the friendly service and the fact they knew our name after the 2nd day and remembered everything we needed! All the staff in the hotel were genuinely friendly!

Oh, I almost forgot to mention the fabulous gym they have with attentive staff. The machines looked as if they were brand new and a wide variety. Everything you need for a great workout. There was a staff member there to help out and spot if needed. He even gave great stretches after your workout. The locker room has a hottub, dry and wet sauna. I wish I had more time each day to get there. Next time I will use the gym facilities more!

"The Hotel is based on one of the most amazing parts of the island. just by telling you that you must really consider the beauty of the scenery. The Hotel is good overall obviously your paying that much for that... I did not like the fact that they have cut off nature and placed concrete in its place. the fauna living there which is very little now has been harmed because of it. I wish they'd had consider this before expanding like they do everywhere they can buy land...

"Scarred with an unpleasant and a forgettable stay at Shangri-la Mactan, we did not expect much from our Shangri-la Boracay stay. Though we've heard that this place is by far one of the best of the Shangri-la chain, we left our expectations at the minimum also because we regularly visit the beautiful Boracay island.

Thankfully, for the price, this Shangri-la did not disappoint. Service was exemplary from our arrival in Caticlan up to our departure via Kalibo airport. The staff (at least most), were ever-gracious and eager to assist you in any way.

I have noted - at least, most of the staff - because there was this staff who appeared from nowhere, while I was talking to somebody in the conierge desk to request for assistance for the possible re-scheduling of our flight booking to an earlier time (same flight date). This other staff just suddenly popped-out of nowhere and remarked (without being asked) that we could actually just go straight to the airport early come flight date and try to be accommodated there for our request for an earlier flight. He must have seen my raised eyebrows and the attending staff's face and he closed his mouth but not before asking me if we want our bookings confirmed.

Suggest that they limit concierge services to be handled by legitimate staff trained for such and limit other staff to areas where they're assigned as this person seemed to have not belonged there.

Daily breakfast buffet was served at the Vintana. Food was the typical 5-star hotel food... Staff were very attentive to the needs of the guests. We've also tried having dinner at this same outlet on our first night and service was very impressive. I was running a fever then so I was not in the mood to eat. While my husband went for the buffet dinner, I opted to just order a small salad. I must have looked really sick that the staff (named PJ) gave me a complimentary hot bread basket and hot soup before my salad was served. Early on, he even brought me reading glasses when he noticed my difficulty reading the menu.

The beach waters were not very friendly during our visit so we spent most of our time in the pool. The staff at the Cielo bar by the pool area were all very nice and attentive.

We enjoyed our Shangri-la stay in Boracay especially since this was a welcome respite for us
after a crazy and grueling schedule the past 2 months. We have had enough of the hustle & bustle of the Boracay beat in the main area and we truly savored the much-more relaxed and serene atmosphere at this side of the island. Although Shangri-la Boracay has a very efficient free shuttle service to D-Mall, Boracay's main hub, first-timers in Boracay might actually feel otherwise.",Staff:Food
"We stayed for 3 nights in the deluxe sea view room. The rooms are spacious and well maintained. I found the bed a bit hard. The bathrooms are beautiful and well planned. And the VIEW…its breath taking. The staff is FANTASTIC. Also, we are vegetarian and at the breakfast buffet they really took care of us. The beach is really good too. We tried the tree top restaurant Rima which had really good food and obviously great staff.. They have some activities going on everyday. They also have a play area for kids.
In the main reception area there are lot of mini water pools which really add to the beauty of the hotel. Most of them have plants as a barrier. But there are some on the side which do not. The lighting there also isn't proper. My daughter ran into it. My husband was right behind thankfully. The staff rushed us to the in-house doctor and thank God everything was OK.
Getting there was quite an ordeal with our boisterous 20 month old. So if you are travelling with younger kid think again! I wish we had. First theres a flight change, then theres a bus to ferry pier, then a ferry and then the final bus to your hotel. And bad weather to top it all. Keep in mind all these things before you plan Boracay.

All in all the Shangri La, Boracay is a beautiful property no doubt, but its for people who want a relaxed holiday.. Its away from all the action. If you are into exploring the city you are better off staying somewhere in the centre of the city.",Staff:Food:Location
"Normally, I over plan family holidays, however, this time I left it up to the agent/quick flick through Tripadvisor. It was beyond our expectations, from arrival to departure this hotel was brilliant. The service, food, rooms, pool, beach, music and atmosphere was perfect. Loved it, loved it....
My husband and I were extremely relaxed as our daughters 5 and 8 were happy 24/7. We will definitely be returning while we are living in Shanghai and will also highly recommend to our families in Australia.",Staff:Food
"We booked this hotel for an anniversary trip, and we had no regrets! From our arrival at the airport, to being checked in in our room (as opposed to the lobby), to the wonderful views, delicious food, comfortable room, beautiful pools and wonderful massage, everything was delightful.
On our first night, we booked a private dinner at the Sea Pavilion. A bit expensive but it was a perfect anniversary dinner. The place was decked in candles, we had the only table, personal chef and waiter, even a small dance floor. And the food from their grill was excellent, especially the lobster and prawns.
On our second day, we took the free shuttle to the main beach of Boracay. It was very easy and the shuttles come and go on a regular schedule so you can plan your time away. Walking through the main beach made me appreciate all the more the privacy at Shangri-La (even their public beach is very private).
We hope to go back someday with our kids. We had such a wonderful time.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"I would say from the outset that we always try to stay at Shangri La but this hotel is incredible. From the time you are picked up, to the time you are dropped off you experience nothing but fabulous service and friendly staff. We stayed in a 2 bedroom pool villa and it is one of the best such arrangements we have ever stayed in.Our butler was a fabulous guy who couldn't do enough for us and would make special surprises for our kids each night to discover. The ladies in the adventure zone are great with the kids and the entertainment centre (for kids and adults) is perfect. It is a bit of a trip to get there but worth it all. Make sure you add this one to your bucket list.",Staff:Location
"this is my second time to be in Boracay shangrila this year. Most the people ( staff ) , that I meet during my first stay ( May ) , where able to recognize me immediately and welcome me back like a family. ( which is nice ) . book a pool villa but was given a upgrade to a HUGE VILLA with a terrific view .
But their are couple things that need to corrected.
1. need to call couple time inquire my luggage , which arrive after an hour .
2. when we are about to take a afternoon nap, I notice white sands in the bed considering we haven't left the room ever since we check in nor been to the beach.
3. when we requested a buggy to bring us the rest. , the buggy driver arrive a bit early , and I ask him to pls wait for 5 minutes bec my wife is still in the bathroom. but when we went out for the buggy it was no where to be found , and we were left standing in the rain ( luckily their is umbrella in the villa ) . Need to call Mr Lee again to inform him about the buggy service. ( I wish the buggy driver has the courtesy to inform or call me , that he need to leave immediately )
4. the beach is great except for foul weather and strong wave which make swimming difficult . 'due to the habagat which I heard start from june to oct( not fault of boracay shang , blame it to mother nature ).

except for couple minor discomfort , overall we have a great overnight stay and if we have long weekend Boracay shangrila is my priority list for vacation.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"For our second stay at Shangri-La Boracay and we stayed in the same Loft Villa as before on request since it’s right at the top of the resort on a boundary with a native forest and feels like we are the only ones in the hotel. Observing the other room options we think this is the best to go for – private and with infinity pool to ourselves with very elevated views of the bay. Magic

And the hot outdoor shower with Victoria falls level of water pressure is so amazing you just cannot leave it.

As with our first visit, all the staff was lovely and frequently went out of their way to accommodate anything we needed or wanted.

Being such a wonderful place – when something does go wrong it stands out more.

Both days we spent on the beach we couldn’t get any drink service – we were down the right hand end of the lounge chairs area and seems that was too far for the staff to serve to. The poor towel attendant ended up going to get someone to come to us. It also seems to take strangely a long time, again both days, to settle the bill and sign off at the beach bar. Perhaps the supervisors were off those days. Small thing really - we could have got off our butt's and got them ourselves.

We discovered the Seafood Platter at Sirena, the resort's signature seafood restaurant, and went back on our last night for another one. Yummy! Seems like everyone orders it as well – hardly seems any need for any other menu items of which there are plenty. My mouth waters just recalling it.

However the experience in Rima which is their high end resort restaurant was less enjoyable. I am sure that when they wrote Truffle on the menu they forgot the word “oil” because everything reaked of Truffle and that can I am sure only come from heavy handed use of Truffle oil rather than the real thing which is far more subtle. I even overheard same comment from table next to us. High end Italian does not mean oceans of Truffle Oil!

So food was a bit of hit and miss – but otherwise totally relaxing and enjoyable. We are sure to come back again sometime.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
Simply one word 'Excellent'. The entire experience right from the dock where a speedbaot picks you up & to the end is simply Amazing. Service is world class & you must try the private dinner at the beach. One of the finest properties I have ever visited.,Location:Food

Champagne, salmon, fillet steak, dessert and fine wines and liquers recommended by the sommelier.

You have your own private beach and the villas even have their own private pool. The place is so big that sometimes, you will need a golf cart to get around.

Free shuttle service are provided by the hotel to get to the other stations of boracay incase you want to see how Boracay is really supposed to look.

Fabulous service!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Location
"Good service with very friendly staff but can be better with handling unanticipated circumstances.

Due to poor weather with very rough sea, we will diverted to another location for the boat transfer to main reception. Normally a 20 mins trip turns into more than an hour - 10mins from waiting lounge to boat location, 40mins boat ride and another 10 mins road trip!!!

While weather condition is out of control, the least is to offer a warm tower (as it was raining) upon guest arrival but unfortunately too many of us came so it put pressure on the front line.

Boat is fully loaded, mini bus is fully loaded, as a result, service level was affected due to unbalance guest-staff ratio. It also doesnt help with the bad weather and the undesirable transfer.",Staff:Location
"Nothing much to say but just that, try it out. You will never regret it. For all muslim, don't worry about the food. Although there is no Halal Kitchen, our food has been taken care off by the Chef who himself is a muslim. Just let the Guest Service knows about your diet. They will do all their means to cater to your needs. We have had no problems at all during the stay and it's great. Nice location, great staffs and a wonderful resort.",Staff:Food:Location
"resort and grounds look straight out of a postcard. overall pleased with the facilities and staff. beautiful beach and very private. shuttles can easily take you to to dmall if you need to get out.

on the downside, we upgraded to a tree villa suite and it can be improved. tree villa has separate living room facilities upstairs. the 2 levels are connected internally, so you have to exit and then go upstairs. this is inconvenient as you have to bring your key card along. also, found that buggy service is often busy and had to call several times and wait 20 mins to get a buggy ride down. lastly, villa came with a butler but she didnt provide any service that was especially useful. phone to contact her didnt work and routed most inquiries through the general line.

so definitely worth visiting and staying, but it looks like a regular room closer to the lobby will suffice.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Right from the moment we came out of the arrival gates of the airport, Shangri-La's service impresses me. The mini bus transfer comes with cold towels and cold drinks - very much needed after the flight. Wifi in the mini bus and wifi all around the resort - even on the beach! We felt very well taken care of, they did not miss a single detall however small. Towels and waters brought to us promptly at the beach, with the occasional fruit juice or tropical fruits. Staff were extremely friendly and polite, I have to say its the most excellent service ever that I have personally encountered. Well done Shangri-la",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I don't believe i have ever been pampered anywhere else. A close second was Pimalai Resort in Koh Lanta, Thailand - but the Shangri-La Boracay takes the crown for the pamper-dom!

The moment I landed at Kalibo airport, I was picked up by hotel uniformed folks at the gate and promptly placed on a van (the whole van was just for the 2 of us)... headed for the Caticlan Shangri-La lounge. A few minutes of waiting at the lounge, we found ourselves on a speedboat to the resort.

The resort is beautiful - and is actually quite self contained. Two private beaches, several restaurants, a games room (pool tables, air hockey, video games etc.) gym, spa.. I personally found it a little expensive to have all my meals at the hotel - and a meal in Boracay town can actually be multiple times cheaper.

The hotel is not in the main Boracay beach - and the only means to get there is the hotel shuttle bus. It runs every half hourly during the peak period and the ride out takes about 10 minutes. While not extremely inconvenient, one has to take note of the shuttle time table and plan your activities accordingly so that you will be on time to catch the van to and fro the hotel. Several occasions I had to wait for several vans before I could get on as the queue for the van was rather long. Having said that, I recognise that Shangri-la has tried to make this as painless as possible for their guests. The vans are new and in tip top condition - and for those times that there is a long queue for the van, they quickly despatch several to clear the crowd.

My most memorable moment was actually my departure from the hotel. I took the 8 am flight out - and had to leave the hotel on the 4am boat. The hotel had prepared a full take-away breakfast for me to eat while on the boat/van trip to the airport... Now, that is what I call the Shangri-La service. :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"No matter how beautiful a beach is, I don't quite enjoy it if it's overrun by people and water activities (not to mention loud music and flaming luaus at night). I think Boracay (station 1, 2, 3) has fallen victim to its own popularity and become a hip place to be and be seen and less of a relaxation destination. Thank goodness Shangri-la Boracay came to the rescue. It has it's own private 2-section beach (Puka Beach station) that may not have as white and fine a sand as the Boracay stations 1-3 but make no mistake that it's still wonderful. And gadzillion times better in terms of tranquility.

"The less than good side of Shangri-La Boracay Resort

Extensive unalligned buildings, make for long winding walks to get anywhere, even if utilizing golf cart assistance.
Not a good idea to visit during habagat season (around August) which brings strong winds, rain, storms & waves. One needs umbrella (provided in room & at reception) or raincoat. Better go during Amihan (late September onwards), unless you want less crowds and lower room rates.
Resort is not senior friendly unless strategically placed either 4th floor for easy access to elevators in both main buildings or 2nd floor to be near beach, also prefer Hilaga wing though will have garden view vs sea view of Timog wing.
Maze like design, allows for greater simulated privacy in alcoved areas but can be confusing for some.
Lots of stairs (slippery wood when raining, perhaps volcanic rock should be used vs wood or polished stone, more foot lighting for wooded stairs to beach is needed at night) & long corridors.
Semi rocky shore, not an issue if waves are not strong but may be mildly painful for tender toes/soles unaccustomed to walking barefoot on hard surfaces.
Slow wifi/wired net access (unless due to storm in the area during our visit, if not it is quite disappointing).
Slow free for use guests pc at entertainment center, it needs a CPU upgrade.
No daily newspapers, have to share at breakfast area or entertainment center, no nightly snacks or turn down treat except as final night in the form of 'thanks for staying chocolates' unlike some guests who got them in late 2012.
Resort has a very extensive + evolving breakfast of adequate quality but mains are a bit weak, focus on quality on top of quantity also. Fresh baked pastries if truly fresh out of the oven (max under 2hrs) are great but losses freshness very fast, retoasting a must. Awful waffles, pancake batter is fine for pancakes but not for waffle grill, tried it soft and 'crispy' still off the mark. Fish + fried selection in particular poor in taste, dry & overcooked. Chinese selection particularly bad, mealy siomai & weird tasting siopao. I would like to suggest the buffet offer deep fried bacon. =)
Musty elevator at Timog wing, needs to be aired out though not a big problem just not pleasant.

I was heavily pregnant with my second child and the front desk was so considerate they gave me a room with the closest walking distance. We had a great view of the ocean.

"Me and my boyfriend stayed in Shangri La boracic last week for 4 nights. We rented a TreeHouse Villa which was just amazing!! It was like paradise. We were treated like king and queens thanks to our personal butler Suzette who made our trip so easy and pain free. Yes, this is the most expensive resort in Boracay but if there is a resort you would splurge on, this is it! It's a 15 min ride to the shopping/restaurants area which was fine because I thought the area was too loud anyway. Boracay is tucked in its own private beach. Just know that when you enter this place you are entering paradise. Literally put your feet up and relax, don't even lift a finger. There is no shortage of workers here. Everyone brings their happy faces to work to greet you.
The view from our villa was breath taking. Imagine a 2 story villa almost 2,500 sq ft with a jacuzzi on your balcony. They made our trip very romantic. We love all the restaurants. My personal favorite is Sirena. Seafood was awesome with a beach view. You can hear the ocean and some romantic live music...aahh!! total bliss. Thanks to all Shangri-la Boracay employees who gave their best services to us. It was definitely a memorable trip.",Location

We stayed in 2 rooms, the first room had a leakage because of the heavy rain, but it was relatively minor. The second room was in between 2 other rooms and it felt not as spacious, and seemed not as clean. But it was very nice nonetheless. Very nice facilities, especially the pool, I love the pool.

"Having stayed in Shangri-La's in Malaysia and really enjoying it, I was eager to stay in this 'newer' branch and I was not disappointed. The resort is vast, so even though it was almost full when I stayed it really didn't feel it. The rooms are spacious and luxurious, and the view is to die for! Arrivals and check-in is a breeze, I always love a hotel that checks you in in the comfort of your room. Some rooms have a Jacuzzi on the balcony, something i'd definitely spring for if I come again! The beach may not have the amazing sands of white sand beach, but it is quiet, spotless and with amazing sunsets, I know which i'd prefer! Only downside is they don't provide waiter service on the beach, then again if they had I may never have moved!
There is a free shuttle bus that runs back and forth from the main stations, great to experience the nightlife there but the best bit was definitely going back to the La! Didn't try the spa as the prices were extortionate and you can get the same treatments outside the hotel for a fifth of the price! Ate at the Italian restaurant which was really nice but not the best I've tried. Views from there would be amazing during sunset as it's set high up in the side of a hill (you take a golf buggy there) however I went when it was dark, still pretty I guess!! The beach bar was great, a fab cocktail list with friendly bartenders, eager to please.
All in all, a fabulous resort, I don't normally say this about places I've been as there are too many other places in the world to see, but I might actually come back!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Before i booked Shangri-La's Boracay, i got mixed feedback from family and friends. So i decided to try it for myself.

Since we arrived early, we had to wait for our rooms to be ready at 12:00 noon. The receptionist was accommodating. But when it was our turn to check in, i guess it was because of the volume of people who arrived, we didn't know whom to turn to. All personnel at the reception area were either busy attending to tourist or pretending to be busy. I noticed a girl at the corner table who was doing nothing, so i sat down in front of her. But instead of asking us if she can help us, she chose to ignore us. I was expecting her to either help us or endorse us to someone who can be of help. She didn't do anything, just sat there as if we were invisible.

I didn't have any problem with the room assigned to us. It was spacious, clean and neat. The room was also huge, it can accommodate at least 6 adults. Everything inside was well kept and orderly. But hubby was disappointed that no shaving cream and razor was provided. We normally travelite. So stuff that we think hotel can provide, we don't bring them. We had to call Housekeeping to ask for razor.

On the 2nd day, i noticed that housekeeping was either lazy or too thrifty. First, our shampoo, conditioner and shower gel were not refilled. They just left it as is. Of course, if you go to a beach or pool, you'd always shower when you go back. But sadly, they didn't refill our toiletries. They too didn't refill the Kleenex tissue. We had to ask housekeeping to provide us on the 3rd day. I think for a 5 star resort/hotel, stuff like this should be well taken cared of. Disappointing that we still had to ask for them. We also noticed that they didn't change our bedsheets on the 2nd day. There were stains due to softdrinks. But housekeeping did not bother to change it. When they took away towels which we used on the first day, they did not even bother to put them back. We had only 1 face towel left to use on the 2nd night, other towels were also taken away but not replaced. Housekeeping were suppose to have an inventory of how many towels there were in every room. So they shouldn't miss out on any.

On the 3rd day, since our flight is late afternoon, we requested for late check out. Around 1pm, housekeeping came knocking at our door. Since we were busy packing, she rang the bell at least 3x. When we finally opened the door, lo and behold, she told us she just wanted to count stuff inside the mini bar. I was shocked. For all the times i have travelled to different places, this is the first time that housekeeping insist on coming inside your room to count if you took anything from their mini bar. Disgusting!

Compared to my usual lengthy reviews, I'm totally speechless. Everything was top-rate.
Service was excellent, rooms & toilet spotless and all the resort facilities were simply just superb. You could spend your entire holiday within the confines of the resort without going around the island and it would still be worth it.

By the way, if you're tired of going to the usual crowded beach with the huddled masses, they've even got their own exclusive beach (or two- didn't go to the other one) that only guests can access.

"We are fans of Shangri-La (Kota Kinabalu, Makati, Sydney...)...even more so after 9 nights of rest, bliss, rain and sun, beaches, spa, pool, adventure zone, entertainment center, swim, paddleboarding, canoying, snorkeling, smiles by the hundreds...service with smiles, politeness, cleanliness...good food, good life! Excellent staff...great managers on duty. Super room attendance and cleaning, Sanie was top!

We felt many guests weren't appreciating being in a 5 stars...a bit pityful at times (noisy, barely polite, wasting food...).

We must say that we disliked the Italian restaurant...a bit snobish to get to it while the food was below par...surely a lapse that must be fixed.

The seafood restaurant has some exquisite dishes. A pizza by the beach bar for dinner listening to the live band is so pleasant...and all the drinks selection so appropriate.

Thank you Ruth and Nina at the Adventure Zone! Thank you Rodney Mike and all your team members!

"My review has been long overdue. Back in London after a month in the Philippines, and I'm still ecstatic about my stay in Shangri-La. To start up with, the service is exquisite and fit for a 5-star hotel. You are treated like royalty the moment you arrive. The area is really awe-inspiring and you never wan't to get out of this paradise just to go back to station 1 or 2. The rooms are gorgeous with a veranda overlooking the beach where you can watch an amazing sunset. The good thing is that they have daily activities with gorgeous amenities to keep you busy, but yet again, just lying in the beach near the infinity pool is already heaven.

"We stayed at Shangri-La, Boracay for 8 nights, and ""Paradise"" is the best way to describe our stay.

The staff was always friendly, our Villa where kept at tip top condition at all time, the restaurants provided excellent food, splendid atmosphere and superb service, the Staff at the bars did their outmost to keep the guests happy, the scenery was superb, the view from the bars where breathtaking, the guys at Scottys Actioncenter (divecenter) where fabulous, the concierge did a very good job (even booked us new tickets when we had to fly out from Caticaln instead of Kalibo), the security-guys where awsome, the buggy-boys where great, the gardeners kept the facility at a tip top state all time, and last but not least: The Chi Spa was fantastic.
For those with children: It's a paradise for children as well! (Pool, activities, Activity-room, possibilities for exploration and completely safe)

Be aware, though:

"This is a slightly late review, based on an 8-day stay in early April of 2013, so ignore if looking for more up to date stuff.

Arrival: Like the reception and boat ride out to the hotel. Check in was good, fast, helpful and informative.

Accomodation: The room was a standard sea view room. Really nice balcony looking out over the beach and sea, with full view of the sunset. Great bed, always sleep like the dead in Shangri La hotels. Large room, comfortable, good housekeeping, clean. Big enough mini bar to stock my own beers purchased in the Budget Mart in town in there...

Location: The grounds and the setting are top. When you're in the resort it feels a bit like the hotel is out in the sticks on its own. Great beaches and great service form the staff on the beach. A note of interest: If you swim around from the southern beach, you can actually swim into and through a cave under the rock outcropping and arrive at the next beach (need to do a short stretch underwater). Was positively surprised by the fact that some small patches of hard corals just off the beach still appeared to be surviving. Used to only seeing dead and dying ones anywhere anywhere near towns/resorts. Also liked the pool area, and the bar by the pool/beach. The other bar is also nice if you can get one of the cabanas facing the sea. However, during our 8 day stay we didn't stand a chance... High occupancy, and they presumably hold them for the people staying in the villas.

Facilities: The facilities are also good, as they should be for a resort hotel. The entertainment room is great for a break and shooting some pool, the gym is maybe a bit under equipped for when occupancy is high, and the instructor stood around watching everything I was doing, which sort of put me off using the gym... There are also outdoor tennis courts, though I have a hard time imagining them being used much since it's far too hot all year round in Boracay. The dive/water sports center offers just about all the water activities that people go to Boracay for. However, if you take the shuttle bus to town, you can do most of them for half the price...
Also a note on closing times: After spending the day in Boracay town/White Beach, when we got back in the evening, the bar down by the pool/beach would be closing already...

Food: Don't bother, just eat in town. Tried the evening buffet on the beach, which was just downright poor. Overcooked everything (soggy pasta and veg, dry seafood, rock hard and dry tuna steaks etc.). The bar food was decent enough, but not good enough to defend the price. Also tried the seafood restaurant, which was good, but compared to the price of a meal there you can eat better food for a week at D'Talipapa by the fish market in town. We also found breakfast a bit of a turn off. Again, the cooked food was generally overcooked, and service was a bit chaotic due to the hotel being pretty full at the time. Several mornings I had to ask anything up to three times to get my coffee, and then sometimes only a single cup, when I like to drink about a liter of coffee in the morning... My wife eventually just stopped going to breakfast, even if it was included in the room rate.

Departure: The check out service here was top notch. They boated us back to the mainland, let me use their computer at their mainland lounge to print out boarding cards, bussed us to the airport, and then an extremely helpful guy got us through check in and into the hotel departure lounge to wait for the flight to leave.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Staying at the Shangri La was a different experience for me, You are quite aware of being in Asia, and Asians know how to make guests feel like royalty.






I enjoyed my stay at the Shangri La very much and would recommend your establishment to anyone going to Asia. It was my first time at your hotel, because i was not familiar with your chain. If ever I find myself on that side of the world again, be assured I will look towards your chain for accommodation.",
"Recently spent 6 nights at this heavenly resort and found myself not wanting to leave! From the minute we got off the plane, we were met with the impeccable true 'Asian' service that you'd expect. The private boat ride to the hotel is a particular highlight - offering some of the most stunning views of the island and the beautiful waters that surround it.
Upon arriving the service continued, as they whisked us away in golf buggies to check us in. Relatively smooth check-in, once we had ironed out a few issues with the reservation, but all together quite pleasant as we were given drinks to enjoy whilst waiting.

We initially stayed in a Deluxe Seaview Room - elegant, modern, stylish and comfortable - the bathrooms being a real highlight - as well as your private balcony with daybeds to enjoy the sunset from...what more could you want?! After a few nights we were then upgraded to a Seaview Suite - very spacious and elegant, beautiful design - an even more lavish bathroom and dressing space! - completed with a stunning balcony, with your own jacuzzi looking out to sea. Both rooms were fantastic and would recommend both.

The resort itself is beautiful, aesthetically pleasing everywhere you look! Thank goodness too for the buggy transportation - as whilst you may not notice it whilst there - it's a big resort! But having said that - we were there during low season and even whilst busy, you very rarely see many people around. It felt very private.
The pools are fantastic, the beaches sublime, the clear water that welcomes you even better, and service just right.
However one thing to point out - I did find that the staff had a bit of 'certainly sir' syndrome....in that they would agree to see to anything you asked for (be it food, drinks, towels, etc) - but then soon forget to do it as you're waiting there for it to arrive. A quick reminder soon sends them on their way as they remember again - but it happened a few times and got a little frustrating - but that's being particularly picky!

The restaurants are fantastic - real nice mix of cuisines - I recommend them all, especially the Rima Italian restaurant - a highlight for us! Don't expect them to be particularly busy though (we were there low season), this is where you come to notice that it's a very quiet resort! Found all the menus, both during the day and evening, to be very reasonably priced. Although the only negative is breakfast tends to be very busy and quite loud...doesn't bother most people I'm sure - but if you're not up for that I'd certainly recommend taking breakfast in the room.

Should you fancy something different too - the shuttle service down to the town is frequent and very easy. Provides a change of scenery too, and there are some fantastic restaurants and bars down there.

Before our arrival I also got in touch with Scotty's Dive (their watersports department) as we were keen to do a private island hopping boat trip. I was put in touch with the manager there, Nicholas, who was incredibly attentive and helpful in finding us what we were looking for. He really went to serious lengths in sorting out the most fantastic day for us. As what we were after wasn't yet available on the island, he came through and managed to source a brand new luxury local banca boat in Boracay, and kitted it out with bean bags, mats, there was a new sound system, provided fantastic Shangri-La service on board with drinks, towels and snacks...he really did go the extra mile to ensure we had a memorable day out at sea. I honestly couldn't recommend it enough - and it is down to Nicholas' diligence, and the fantastic team on board that we were able to do it! If you're up for a day out at sea - I suggest you get in touch with him! And again...very reasonable!

I'm whaling on a bit - but that's probably demonstrating just how much of a good time we had at this resort. I honestly couldn't recommend it enough - whether it's quality time with family or loved ones, friends, or just simply needing some time out from a busy work schedule...this is the place to escape to! We'll be going back...",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The best choice for ultimate rest & relaxation. Everything was very soothing. From the music to the scent to the view. We didn't go wrong in choosing Shangri-La Boracay for our Honeymoon.

"The most expensive resort in Boracay. But really without any special service. And location , even the beach quality at Shangri-La is not as good as the rest of boracay station 1
hotel staff are different, some are nice some are arrogant and not welling to help , too many facilities , also it is not easy to go to the mall, room service is too expansive, and we really have to walk in the hot weather to reach the beach",Location:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"The amazing service starts the moment your flight arrives in Boracay, and you wait a few minutes in a luxury lounge for your private boat to take you to the hotel. The excitement builds as you whisk past amazing beaches and sail boats on the short ten minute boat ride to the hotel.

The hotel itself is nestled on a small hill, with great views over the clear blue water of the ocean. With 2 private beaches, and the biggest infinity pool in Asia, there is plenty of relaxation going around. The facilities are first class, with the hotel being just 3-4 years old.

And now for the best part. The people. This is what makes this hotel truly great. People are friendly, attentive and anticipate your needs.

Well done Shangri-La.",Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri-la is the best hotel/resort in Boracay. Their customer service has surpassed all best services I have seen and experienced. They're very friendly, courteous and attentive to all your needs. My 8 yr. old daughter lost her sunglasses, she forgot where she left it and they were able to help me find it considering the resort is about 12 hectares big while we were relaxing at their entertainment zone. It's pricey but well worth it! If you want to experience superb treatment this is the right place for you.",Staff:Value for money
We enjoyed our stay especially the children. There were daily activities for adults and kids. Breakfast food was good but not the best. There were plenty of choices though. We left our children in the Adventure Zone for a few hours and they didn't mind it. The staff here were very nice and pleasant.,Food:Staff
"Truly had a 5-star experience during our recent stay in June 2013. Not only is in nestled in the cove of one of the islands in Boracay, it was masterplanned to have a fantastic view, architecturally handsome buildings and villas, with world-class service! Staff was ultra-friendly, always ready to lend a helping hand. Amazed at how they all catered to my mom, who was mobility-impaired...Food in the hotel was good quality, just pricey. Truly enjoyed the breakfast buffet with varying cuisines and this is already included in the room rate. Definitely away from the hustle and bustle of the town, this is a place to relax and just be you... If looking for the crowds and the noise, there is shuttle service to and from D'Mall (town proper) every hour. Shuttle service was ever-ready to accomodate all 20 of us in one big van! Given a 2nd chance, I will definitely go back!",Food:Staff
"I was always biased towards Boracay as a ""party place"" and not much of rest, relaxation and romance. Shangri-La Boracay (SLBO) totally changed all that from the moment we arrived in the Kalibo (KLO) airport when they had a rep to assist us with our baggage and bus transfers. To top it off, we were the only guests of SLBO on our flight. SLBO went out of the way to welcome us.

Everything in SLBO is just absolutely fantastic - the rooms, the electric vehicles, the food and most especially the people. They were very supportive when I shared plans a week earlier that I wanted to propose to my girlfriend here. Even via online, their restaurant/reservations team sent me packages for our special moment.

Truly, I felt the support of the entire SLBO team for ""our"" surprise (I was not alone in the planning and I felt it), from the VIP treatment at the airport to the awesome-ness of the place. Even Rima, where I proposed, had a lovely evening view with delicious food and the perfect ambience. Even the other guests of the resort were fantastic (we were seated beside an Australian couple married for 37 years! who shared their wisdom with us)

So there it was: lovely place, clean air, delicious food, absolutely fantastic people, #TheProposal was planned and executed perfectly. SLBO literally changed my life for the better.

I give SLBO 6 stars out of 5.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Where do I start. I came for a look and experienced service beyond anything I had ever experienced around the world. Everyone was so courteous,warming and friendly and spent quality time with our small group showing us the resort and all it had to offer from restaurants, spa, villa the private beaches I was stunned with it's natural beauty. Can I also thank Franz Completo for the time he spent with us. His phone was very busy but he didn't rush showing everything that Shangri-La had to offer, even down to a courtesy drink and refreshing towel at the end. Everyone needs to come and experience this first class service, you won't be disappointed.",Staff
"My family and I returned recently from a 10-day stay in this beautiful hotel. We knew the ""rainy"" season was starting and indeed the last couple of days were quite grim but nothing can take away from the overwhelmingly positive experience we had at the Shangri-La.
We initially thought we would explore the island a bit but ended up staying at the hotel the whole time as we didn't want to miss out on any relaxing time. Starting with a fantastic breakfast in the morning, we then spent the whole day at the beach where we always had sunbeds available (somehow it seems Asian tourists prefer to go there for max 1 hour to take pictures of themselves there..:-)), great service (Bam, we mean you!), had lunch right there, snorkeled, relaxed, and then ended up the day at the beach trying out the different cocktails offered. Food was best in our opinion at Rima although Sirena was nice as well. Vintana is great for breakfast but dinner there is a bit depressing as quite empty. We tried out the spa (wonderful experience even though expensive), the children spent around an hour every day at the Entertainment Centre when they were tired, my parents-in-law had a massage near the beach as well - it was all lovely. The grounds were beautiful, the rooms very nice and most of all, the service was delivered with warmth and a big smile. Special mentions to Laudito at the pool area, Bam at the beach, Nathaniel at the bar, Lun at breakfast, Tisa and Sianna at Rima. Thanks for making this a special stay for the 6 of us.
The only thing we can fault was the arrival at Caticlan airport as we were made to wait a full hour at the lounge before we could finally take the boat to the hotel and after an overnight flight with children, that wasn't nice. Also, on the way back for some reason, we were again deprioritised vs other guests and had to wait at the lounge (airco not working) before we were finally taken to the airport.
All in all, a wonderful stay - would love to return in the future!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I broke one of my own rules with this one - I never left the ""hotel"" from the moment I checked in to the moment I checked out. I normally make sure I explore wherever it is that I am visiting. This place though was just so amazing I neither felt the need nor desire to venture further. That said, I was only there for a weekend and my plan was R&R.

From the moment the staff meet you in the tiny arrivals hall of Caticlan airport until they safely deposit you back in their dedicated lounge for the return flight home you are incredibly well looked after.

6 or 7 family groups all arrived at the hotel at the same time yet each group was greeted immediately by their own hostess to check them in and show them to their respective rooms. I was booked into a standard deluxe room which I think is the lowest tier they offer here. It was absolutely perfect. The bedroom was spacious and had a couch as well as a desk area. The bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was big, with a separate shower and bath as well as his and her sinks. The 2 sliding door options was a nice touch - one opening out into the bedroom area and the other in the more tradition vestibule area.
The balcony had both a table and chairs and a pair of day beds, perfectly secluded. I was on the 3rd floor so my view was the tops of the tropical forest. This made it amazingly atmospheric when we had a downpour on the Saturday evening.

The grounds of this hotel are extensive with 2 private beaches, lots of paths, gardens and forest to wander through. The main pool is a wonderful, interestingly shaped pool with an infinity edge pointing towards the sea. Despite its curious shape it is still possible to swim lengths (not sure of the length, but they definitely felt like more than 25m).

I spent a good few hours on the beach, the one nearest the main pool. The staff that looked after this area were always available and attentive yet also unobtrusive. I also noticed there was always a life guard present.

I made use of the gym. It was on the same spacious scale as everything else in this resort and had a good range of equipment - cardio, resistance machines, free weights, etc. On arrival they had also given me a class schedule. They have a yoga/aerobics studio for those who prefer group exercise activities.

When I wanted to go for dinner at the sea-food restaurant, located on the rocky outcrop that separates the two beaches it was raining. No problem - a golf buggy was almost immediately made available to drive me the short hop so I wouldn't get wet. When I signed the bill after dinner the waiter similarly asked if I wanted a buggy summonsed to collect me. I chose to move outside to the bar and enjoy listening to the sounds of the sea over a cocktail. I just had to ask the barman and he called for a buggy.

The only thing I am not raving about is the breakfast. Don't get me wrong, it was perfectly OK however not comparable to breakfasts in other hotels of this class/scale I have visited.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
Stayed here for 3 nights (June 15 to 18). Service was the best with staff assisting us the moment we arrived at the airport up to the our return flight to Manila. Stayed in the seaview room and the the view was fantastic. A very good choice to rest and escape from a stressful work life.,Staff:Location
"This is the perfect place to get some quiet relaxation and feel like royalty. I think this is the first resort I have ever been into that has the most amenities. Despite the fact that we were a big group travelling together (apart from the 5 other groups who arrived with us), the people in ShangriLa were very organised, they ushered all of us and catered to all of our needs. The way they handled the transactions such as credit card charges, deposits etc. was so unobtrusive and very polite which i really appreciate because most hotel establishments these days lack this. They also handed my other family members brochures and activity sheets while i do the required forms so that they weren't just sitting down bored.

One of the biggest thing that i love about the resort is its divine architecture. It almost feels like the beauty of the resort itself steals the thunder of the natural beauty of the ocean and the beach. I mean, every angle of the resort seems like a majestic place to do some meditation or a landscape for a flickr photo. The interior was tastefully done. I can tell that even the smallest details were taken into consideration such as signs for the elevator that used Capiz shells and each drainage has an artistic twist wherein water that drains down trickles along this metal bell shape rod. You won't be able to resist taking a macro shot of it!

I also appreciate the fact that just a few steps from the lift, there is a nice little hut with a phone wherein when you pick it up someone will automatically be at the other end to assist you to call for a buggy to bring you wherever you want. I didn't know that there was a shortcut from our room to the lobby and the pool which is why we used the buggy so much. It was only on our last day that i got to explore the resort and found out that all of the buildings were interconnected and was fairly near to each other! That really amused me because looking from the outside, it seemed that the resort was made up of different buildings.

The pool was absolutely divine, it was heated which i think a lot of people quite like but personally i like pools that are cooler specially when you take a dip during a hot sunny day. The water temperature was a bit warmer than i expected. If the waves weren't too harsh during my stay i would have preferred to swim in the ocean because i was looking for a cooler swim. The jacuzzi spots that was spread through the pool was really amazing, there were always more than enough for everyone.

The staff by the pool and the beach were the best! They were so friendly and warm and knew what i wanted even before i asked for it! It's like they could read minds! They always made sure that your sun bed was covered with fresh and dry towels and an extra towel at the end of the bed for when you get out after your swim. They came and offer fruit shakes a few minutes after i got back on my sun bed, who knew i was hankering for a Pina Colada at the same exact moment?! Brilliant! Their beach front was fabulous. There were sun beds with umbrellas and 3 round lofts which i loved! I spent most of my time in one of the orange lofts, getting a tan and reading a book. When i asked for drinks, they even had a small wooden table that they brought out so that i can rest my drinks on it. It was a shame that the waves were quite large during my stay, I kept getting swept towards the coral part of the ocean and hurt my feet a little. The sand was fine although the grains were quite bigger compared to the shores of Boracay ""stations"". Relaxing around this area is very serene and quiet which i really liked. Around 5pm, happy hour starts and the acoustic band starts to play only the most perfect and fitting songs for the beach such as Obidiah Parker's rendition of Hey Ya!, John Mayer and Jason Mraz songs. The songs were soft and smooth just the way I wanted it to be. I know one group of 20 somethings were looking for a really loud crazy bar and decided to go out of the resort and find one since Shangri La didn't have it. ShangriLa is perfect for you if you want to escape the hustle, bustle, club scene that you can find in Metro Manila. This is the place to find a really relaxing and serene spot and be spoiled to your toes.

The rooms were fantastic. We were three in one room and it was very comfortable. The bathroom had its separate rain shower, loo and bath tub. All of the soaps were of great quality (L'Occitane) and the provided toiletries were really complete, i regretted bringing my toiletries bag, honestly. They even provided hair ties!

The only comment i have for the rooms are the pillows. I requested for 3 more extra pillows since most of the pillows on my bed were flat and deflated every time i rest my head on it.

The Breakfast at Vintana was pretty good, breakfast was absolutely delicious and they offered good varieties such as the yogurt station, pancake or waffle station, 2 eggs stations and even a corner for asian breakfasts such us dimsum and porridge.

Since we were a group I decided to reserve a table for eleven people but the person who was in charge of the seating discouraged me to wait for a table of twelve and just get a table for the four of us since the buffet was full. I wish they give importance on the fact that we traveled as a group or at least booked a table for us ahead of time. It also took quite some time before we got seated.

Dinner at Vintana was a little underwhelming though, I was expecting more choices of main courses from the buffet and when i asked the chef from the sushi bar to make me a temaki, the temaki that he served me was of bad quality. The Nori seemed old because it was hard to bite on it and the flavour of the sushi rice was a bit unappetising. Also, I was surprised that the chef at the dessert station could not fulfill my request of a small chocolate soufflé with ice cream which i think is called ""Verona"" because apparently, ""it was not served at the buffet"". The first time i went to Vintana (a few months ago), I was able to request this during their lunch buffet and I didn't understand why they would stop serving it. It was really disappointing because I was looking forward to have it again during my stay.

All in all, I felt that i did not get my moneys worth dining at Vintana. The service was not as impressive compared to the other areas of the resort and the food was underwhelming, the room service food was more delicious compared to the meals i had in Vintana buffet. I should have just ordered room service for dinner (. This is what weighs down my review from 5 stars to 4 stars. I was expecting better quality of food and service for the price we paid for their buffet and knowing that Vintana is their main restaurant in the resort.

Leaving ShangriLa wasn't as smooth as i would have expected comparing it to the way they handled our arrival. Our flight was 7am which is why we had to catch the 5am ferry. The night before, we requested our breakfasts to be packed so that we can eat it at the private airport lounge. They packed 2 pieces of pastries each and half a cup of coffee. This was really disappointing, not only were the coffee cold upon arriving at the Mabuhay center, it was half empty. It did feel a bit short changed because we have paid for a buffet breakfast each and all we got were 2 stale pastries and half a cup of cold coffee. I also wish that the Mabuhay center were as accommodating as they were when we arrived, but upon our departure they did not even serve bottles of water or coffee or tea! It would make sense that they would serve hot drinks specially for guests like us that were leaving at 5-7am.

I would highly recommend this resort and spa and would definitely come back again for a vacation, however I will explore their other restaurants and order from room service more.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"We stayed in Shangri-La Boracay last November for our honeymoon. It's an outstanding hotel and resort. The food is really good (if expensive), with several restaurants to choose from. Staff are very friendly. We decided to upgrade to a villa on our arrival - this was expensive, and set us back about 1,000 Euro per night (whew! - it was our honeymoon though). Perhaps you can get a better deal if you book in advance. The villas are awesome though - your own private pool, and a butler at your beck and call. We didn't know what to ask the butler to do but it was a a real novelty to have one at our disposal. I couldn't recommend it highly enough - they pick you up from Caticlan airport and wait on you hand and foot until they leave. Really nice place - best hotel/resort I've ever stayed at I think. Really nice breakfast, great private beach",Food:Staff:Value for money
"My Fiance & I stayed on Boracay for 7 nights; 2 of which were at the Shangri La and the other 5 on white beach. Arrival from Catilan was a breeze and they allowed us to check in early and check out late which was great. Highlights were the beautiful beach, comfortable beds, super friendly staff, happy hour drinks, fresh seafood, fresh juice at breakfast, pork adobo, kayaking, snorkeling, and epic sunsets.

"We cannot be more pleased and amazed about the great time we had while we were in Boracay. The Filipino food was simply awesome and the way they treat you is outstanding, WOW!!!! We wish we could have spent more days over there. We stayed for 5 nights at the Shangri-La's and we just don't have words to say how cool and gorgeous was it. Everything so clean, buggy transportation all around the resort, free shuttle bus service from airport to resort and resort to Dmall, huge and delicious fresh breakfast buffet, peaceful environment, breathtaking, clean, clear, quiet, private beach. The Spa was a marvelous experience, OH MY GOD!!!! You must try the package of 3 hours couple treatment; you will love it, just like we did. We enjoyed the massages, treatments, and kindness from the Filipino people at the resort and spa. We highly recommend this option, you will not regret it. We celebrated our anniversary and we would love to go back once again.",Food:Staff:Location
"I have stayed here twice- very nice hotel to stay at. Service is ok but the private shuttles that we rented to go into town were quite expensive! With the amount you pay, a shuttle to wait for you shouldn't cost an arm and a leg. If you go out at night to the many clubs, it sometimes gets annoyingly far to go home late at night. Service is standard Shangrila service, the food is good but nothing extraordinary. The Shang would probably be the most child friendly resort though there is today in Boracay.

Having been to Boracay many times, staying at the Shangrila is not quite the real Boracay experience that many people have experienced over the years.

I would stay at the Shang if I didn't plan to leave the resort - if you are a celebrity or the like and want your privacy, this is the place for you.

If it is your first time in Boracay, you must get out of the hotel to see the real Boracay that many have fallen in love with.",Food:Value for money:Location
"There are so many positive things to say about this resort. Perhaps the only problem I had was that the walk to the beach and the main lobby was a long one from the room. I guess that also depends on which wing you stay at. With three children under 9 years old in tow; our experience was very pleasant. Thankfully, the entertainment center was excellent and the play area for children was so nice and big! The beach was a bit rocky, and the waves on the right side of the resort was quite big. On the left side of the resort, the beach is longer but the waves sometimes get big so it's best to stay very close to your children- especially if they are still of toddler age. I loved the convenience of getting to and from the resort - on the private boat that takes you to Shangri-la's private port. It worked out perfectly. The food is quite okay- not excellent but good enough. Rima, the Italian restaurant... is a pretty little place to visit. Over all, our stay was fun for everyone! And expensive haha!",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Tucked in a more secluded part of Boracay, away from the noise and crowd of the popular white beach, Shangri-la lived up to its commitment to provide luxury, tranquility, and impeccable service. It's the best place to experience the warmth of authentic Filipino hospitality at its finest. The staff are very friendly with beaming faces and proactive in attending to our requests. Even the chef in Vintana restaurant has been very helpful! Two thumbs up too for the sumptuous buffet breakfast - crispy bacon was delectable! The resort was spacious and sometimes even disorienting as the lobby lounge is situated on the fourth floor. I also loved the swimming pool! Beach was not that great for me since the sands are not as powdery as the ones in the stations. You still have to ride the free shuttle that departs every hour in order to get there. Despite the confusion upon leaving the hotel that almost got us late for our flight, I am still pretty much satisfied with my Shangri-la Boracay experience.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We have been to Boracay before and decided we would never come back as we felt it was like a beautiful beach spoilt by wild tourists and the red light district feel on the main beach. We were gifted a 3 night stay in Boracay by our bestfriend last November. We hesitated at first however he assured us that we would be surprised how Shangri-La Boracay would change our thoughts about the island. Indeed, he was right.

We came during perfect weather and there weren't too many tourists as it would be during the Philippine summer months of Mar-May, just right. There were mostly foreigners staying when we were there and had a few locals as well. The reception manager checked us in and walked us to our room (fantastic touch!) and congratulated us on our anniversary with such warmth that Filipinos are famous for. The waiters by the beach anticipated our needs without the need to call them and we had drinks, food and new towels without raising a hand. The breakfast buffet had an amazing selection and though we don't have children yet we appreciated that they had a separate children's buffet that had lower tables and reachable for the kiddoes. We promised to keep a mental note of this hotel when we have children in the future! We loved the private beach that the hotel had as it was away FAR FAR FAR AWAY from the crowds of Stations 1-3 where we wouldn't dare sunbathe on. The free private shuttle going in and out of the bustling centre was fantastic as it would be very uncomfortable to take the rickshaw all the way to the hotel. We found a few wonderful little details about this hotel that we haven't seen in others much: one, they have free postcards in the hotel room and they'll even send it for you for free. Oh how we love writing postcards and ofcourse we wrote about how beautiful our stay was! Next, they had two different sizes of hotel slippers - male and female. Lastly, they had a hair tie for women which is fantastic as I always forget or lose mine whilst swimming!

Boracay island as a whole has changed in the last 8 years we have been there. The water sports have been moved farther away from the main beach so the view isn't as distorted as it was before. There are more better restaurants these days that wasn't all about deep fried food and also took pride in plating and ambience. Just be wary about choosing which airline to fly to Boracay. We flew on Airphil Express and other family who joined us last minute flew on Cebu Pacific. To be quite honest there's not much difference in both airlines - they were both canceling flights here and there which was a huge hassle for all of us. So make sure that if you're flying there to make enough time for your transfers. We were flying back to Europe on our last day and we were happy that we were able to get out of the island on time.

"My wife and I stayed here for three night in Jan 2013, and had a very relaxing, wonderful time. Starting with the very convenient boat trip from the airport, swift and convenient check in and smiling and helpful staff we were able to completely relax. The breakfast buffet is indescribable with more variety than you can imagine. We were particularly impressed with the variety of tropical fruits, and when we mentioned which ones we particularly liked, those same fruits began appearing in our room daily. The spa was incredible. Beautiful and totally relaxing. This was one of the best vacation stops we've ever had, and we won't hesitate to go back.",Food:Staff
"Had a short visit earlier this month just to try out the number one resort on Boracay. This exclusive, off public property is rather vastly spread and nestled in a semi forested area. It has a calm and peaceful surroundings and gives us a badly needed short reprieve away from the busy and loud boat stations downtown... While exploring this huge resort, we somehow felt that this place really lacks the exclusive character of a world class resort. The pool attendants and security guards were a little wary and suspicious of our presence there... we were even being asked for our room number at one point while admiring the beach front and strolling in the beautiful gardens. Kind of intimidating for us! Apart from the mentioned unpleasant encounter, other services rendered by the other staff ranging from the Housekeeping, Concierge up to the Guest Relations Officers were of excellence standards... Overall I feel that this resort is too expensive and over rated!",Staff:Location
"After a week at Discovery Shores (also highly recommended) we moved into a Loft Villa at the Shangri-La. Amazing from start to finish. Expectations were set high for this stay and the Shangri-La delivered. From a welcoming check-in to a warm good-bye the stay was of the highest quality. The Loft Villas are very large with an infinity pool that was bigger than the plunge pool I thought it was going to be. Butler service (thank you Mike) is wonderful, and I especially enjoyed being taken around and shown the resort and facilities on arrival. Room service is speedy. The property is incredible and so well designed. Our villa had amazing views of the beach. The staff and their warmth are a key part of making it such a memorable place. Nothing was too much trouble as Butler Mike took on responsibility for booking whatever we wanted from dining to activities. Yes, the dining and drinks are more expensive than the main parts of White Beach, but you are paying for quality, service and convenience. For Australian travellers, it is comparable to a decent restaurant with much cheaper beer and cocktails. (Wine as may be expected is on the pricier side). Sirena's seafood platter was bliss, as was the dining at Rima. Having an abundance of Italian food in Australia, we weren't all that keen to try it, but Rima's food was original and far beyond pasta and pizza only. The Alona bar by the pool has the best service and cocktails on the island. (Thank you Roland for the chats and recommendations). Solana near Sirena is amazing for tapas and sunset cocktails.
I even braved cheating on my hairdresser and had my hair cut and coloured at the salon (about half the price one would pay in Australia) and came out with one of the best cuts and colours ever. (Thank you Russell!)

Butler Mike organised our transfers in Manila (travel between terminals can take over an hour in peak traffic) and thank goodness as I don't think we would have made our flight without the wonderful driver who got us to our departure terminal safely and in record time.
The property is a little removed from the main stretch of Boracay so up to each traveller to decide if they even want to leave the property or spend their entire stay at the 'La'.
A huge thank you for a wonderful and unforgettable stay - we are so looking forward to coming back.",Food:Value for money:Location
"Yes perfect paradise location and a must if you can stretch the budget.

Standard Rooms still great size for family of 2 adults and 2 kids, all to shanghai la standard. Service is impeccable, the staff are all very attentive and genuinely friendly. Our poolside waiter is their current star employee and no wonder, he never stopped!

The great shuttle bus service gets you to white beach day and night action however the restaurants and nightly buffet options are great at the hotel, just a little pricier than white beach obviously.

Breakfast buffet is staggeringly good and if you get there late enough, there's no need to do lunch!

We did the spa as an anniversary treat and although very expensive (the triple tax and service charges are abhorrent) its really is a fine treat indeed. Private, palatial, calming, and the feeling that you are really a star beating pampered. We took some family friends who have travelled extensively in this region, they said its the best resort they have stayed in by far.

Would go again definitely!",Food:Location:Staff
"What is there to fault about the Shangri-la? If I want to be minute on the details, I would say the pillows were really thin and I had to sleep with about 4 of them, but I just feel silly writing a review about such things!

This hotel was just lovely and what you would expect from 5 star. However, the hotel is priced to the extreme (especially for Asia) and so your expectations naturally are higher. We paid around AUD $500-$550 per night for a standard room. I've travelled all over Asia, stayed in many 5 star hotels and Shangri-la Boracay is to date the most expensive hotel I've stayed in anywhere in the world. And I hate to say this but unfortunately, it's also not much different from many other 5 star hotels in Asia that are half the price. So overall, great hotel but not great on value at all - with all the ++ and meals, drinks etc. we left there feeling like we had a hole in our pocket and because of that fact, I would not stay there again.",Value for money
"I expected more from a $1000/ night property. We stayed at a treetop villa which was great. electric curtains/ blinds, excellent bathroom amenities, partial complimentary mini bar, large confortable bed. It is no doubt the best in Boracay but you dont get much for your money. I have listed the pros/ cons below:

Pros:
- The butler service was at a higher standard than other butler service I have experienced. They provide you with a mobile phone which you can call the butler at any time. You need this since the guest services line is not always answered.
- The private beach was one of the best private beaches in Asia. I was surprised by the number and variety of fish in the area. Bring your own snorkeling gear as the property only has a few sets to rent out.
- Staff were friendly and overall service was good.

Cons
- This luxury property overall lacks exclusivity. Everyone dines, plays, pools, beach in the same area and can get quite rowdy. I later found out the property offers steep discounts to local residents to fill the hotel. There was not a moment that I cannot hear the breakfast room with kids screaming and have peace and quiet on the beach/ pool area.
- The food was very expensive for its quality. It really needs to improve. It ranges from missing room service items to bad tasting food. This really is not good enough from a 5 star resort.
- Plenty of buggys but not enough drivers between 6pm-7.30pm. You can be left waiting for 20mins despite many prompt phone calls.
- The technique of the masseurs were poor for a luxury hotel. (try and tested by 2 people)
- All activities and add ons were super expensive. Parasailing for 1 person for 15mins through the hotel will cost almost as much as a helicopter ride in New York for 15mins.
- Transfer cost from hotel to Kalibo airport was double of what South West travel would charge for a private transfer. Tip: I contacted South West Travel directly and booked/ paid and got picked up at the welcome centre after my boat ride.
- I did book to have the hotel arrange transfer from Manila Terminal 4 to Terminal 1 which had cost me US$20 for a 10 min ride
- Be aware the tub on the balcony of the treetop villa is huge. This means it will take almost 45mins to fill up. By the time it is filled up, the water has already cooled.

The main issue with the property is that it is not good value for money. I have stayed at many $1000/ night properties that are nicer and with more to offer. $1000/ night + food + activities + adds up. You might as well spend the money at a more luxurious and exclusive resort for $1000/night and not having to put up with the rowdiness.

The property really needs to lower the rate or at least lower it so it is on par with local residents rate.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We had our hearts set on Shangri-la Boracay after reading mostly glowing reviews on Tripadvisor. One of our worries though is that the reviews set the bar so high. Plus, we work hard for our money, so we are particular on how we spend it. Would we find the stay worth it?

Oh yes we did.

We have a 22-month old daughter, so her safety and comfort are our primary concerns. These are the reasons why we enjoyed Shangri-la Boracay:

1. Efficient processes from arrival to departure. From the moment we arrived at the Caticlan Airport, we had someone taking care of us, and our luggage. The hotel has its own waiting lounge for its speedboat, with cool towels and juice.

The same person who welcomed us when we arrived also helped us when we left (he even helped with the airline check-in process). Shangri-la also has its own lounge at the airport departure area, which helped because our flight was delayed.

2. Luxurious and well-maintained rooms. Shangri-la's property is far from White Beach, but their advantage is how they maximized and utilized their space. The bedroom was huge, with a balcony. The bathroom was also huge, with a tub, two sinks, and separate toilet and shower. They also maintain the resort well. No sand on indoor floors.

3. The little details. So I emailed them to request for a baby cot. They provided that, plus they gave Monique welcome cookies and milk. They also child-proofed the room corners. I also emailed to mention we were celebrating our birthdays. They gave a whole cake. Who does that?! Oh, and on the beach, they give cold water, cold towels, and fruits.

4. Private and semi-private beach. We appreciated these the most because again, we are traveling with a toddler who can get bothered by noise and crowds. The sand is not the same as White Beach, but the water is crystal clear. I also felt safe because there were discreet security personnel.

The only negative thing I can say is that we didn't want to leave. Please, take our money, and we can stay forever! Seriously, we wanted to extend a night (again, the staff helped out with this). But PAL domestic flights need to be rebooked at least 24 hours in advance. This is a bit funny and ironic because PAL moved our flight times without telling us (I found out only when I called to check on another matter). Also, our flight back was delayed for an hour. Oh well, it gives us another reason to go back :-)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I've been to boracay a number of times, but this was the first time I had the chance to enjoy it in a private beach without the crowd.

We felt well taken care of from the moment we step off the plane till the day of our departure to manila. Their staff even helped on checking us in on our return flight.

Stayed at a tree house villa, and took the honeymoon package which included the spa treatment and private sea pavilion dining.

The villa was huge! Very spacious and relaxing. Having a personal butler to ring for each and every need was the ultimate add-on to a relaxing holiday. He even offered to prepare the jacuzzi bubble bath every afternoon we were there. So when you're tired from sun bathing on the beach, you have an option to go back to your room and have the jacuzzi waiting with a warm bubble bath:)

We got lucky with a villa that had the perfect beach and sunset view from both the bedroom and the second floor livingroom and jacuzzi area. You get what you pay for, in service, food and amenities.

The villas are on a cliff, but you dont really notice the travel to the beach as you can easily call for a buggy to pick you up or drive you to your villa from the beach or main hotel building.

The touch of leaving a gift of fresh fruit basket, chocolates etc at the end of the day was nice.

For the romantic dinner, the music, food and overall ambiance was perfect. Candle lit dinner, petals and candles on the stairs and floor...the works! You have the sea pavilion to yourself as they only allow one couple there a night, thus the need to reserve for the dinner before your arrival.

The spa treatment provided with the package is a massage that last for an hour, we decided to upgrade for a two hour massage. It was quite relaxing I doze off through most of it.

I'm not sure about the other rooms, but for the villa stay you have the option of having the breakfast served to your room free of charge which was rare in most of the hotels I stayed in. We felt lazy going to the buffet breakfast hall and the butler offered to have the food sent to our villa.

You have a private beach without the crowd from the main beach, yet also still have an option to go to the main beach and mix with the crowd shopping, eating and sun bathing at the different stations of the main white beach.

Overall you get what you pay for with the Villa stay at Shangrila Boracay....",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"As per various travel books this was the place to be for the sunset and the food. And in no way we were disappointed. They gave us a private cabana to watch it and meanwhile we drunk Sangria (too much as it was happy hour) and had fantastic food having a three course dinner. The service is outstanding and so was the food. Nothing less than fantastic and very tasty. However a dinner for 4 cost us almost Euro 360,00 which is quite steap although it was worth it. So recommend people that will go there on a lower budget to watch what they will order! We were the first ones to come to the restaurant that evening and the last ones to leave so think that other guests ordered less.",Food:Value for money
"The Shangri-la is one of a kind resort. The beaches are amazing, the rooms are fantastic. We had a number of problems whilst we were there, but still could not justify giving this resort any less than 5/5!

I would advise that the staff remember to provide the welcome drinks on arrival, and also to speed up their service. A couple of times we were waiting a long time for the check, but we weren't too fussed as the surroundings of the resort are first class.

I personally loved the restaurant (particularly the seafood buffet), the breakfast, spa, gym and the pool - all world class!

We were staying at the resort during an unfortunate time when the resort had three powercuts in 12 hours, we were not happy with the soundproofing in our room either. We made this known to the resort manager via email, who has assured us that changes will be made to improve this in future. With that in mind, we will definitely be back.",Staff:Food
"Pools and beach area are definitely the highlight - sitting there now! Large pool area with multiple pools and lots of shade. Stayed two nights in a deluxe king room. The room is good size with a very large veranda with two comfortable chase lounges and small table with a couple of chairs. The room includes a work desk with convenient multi-country electric outlets and small couch with table. The bed is a little hard, but very comfortable, particularly the pillows. Bathroom is great with double vanity, toilet stall, separate shower and soaking tub. Shower could be a little cleaner - a bit of mold. The breakfast is great, with a huge selection and about any kind of eggs you could want. I found service to be very good at the hotel.

They operate a very convenient shuttle service, meeting your arriving flight and immediately transfer you via a boat, directly to the hotel pier. Also, they operate a shuttle service which operates on a regular schedule to take you into the local town.

The hotel has a great gym with excellent weight machines and cardio, all by life-fitness. It is all pretty new and in great shape.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Went back to Shangri-La Boracay for the second time in February. Originally went there in 2011 and it was pure heaven. Although the weather wasn't as nice this time, it was still a wonderful holiday.
Booked into the Treehouse villa but there was a problem with the outdoor lights so we got moved to the villa on the beach, which is fantastic.
It was the end of Chinese New Year so the resort was still quite busy, however this doesn't affect the attitude and professionalism of the staff. Everyone was great.
This is a great location if you're looking for a nice relaxing break away with 5 star facilities.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"My partner and I stayed at The Shangri-La resort and spa in Boracay in The Philippines as our second stop at the end of January 2013. We stayed for 5 nights.

I have now stayed at 5 Shangri-La resorts/hotels and I always know what I am going to get as every time I have visited, I have always, without fail, received a wonderful unforgettable service. This resort is definitely situated in the best part of Boracay, very exotic, beautiful beaches and wonderful people.

We had a bad experience trying to reach the place but once we got there, it was worth all of the stress we had gone through. I blame Philippine Airlines and Manila Airport. For a big city, and a big business centre, they couldn't organise a p******** in a brewery!!!! We were very delayed and it was not a good experience, but as I said, once we reached The Shangri-La, it was so worthwhile.

I totally recommend this resort and would love to return.",Location:Food
"We had a wonderful time - starting from the reception and send-off from the airport. Definitely impeccable service everywhere, especially at the beach and poolside. Even the free wi-fi internet signal at the beach is good, should one need to get in touch with the outside world. The breakfast buffet has something to offer for anyone's taste.

"I got married at the Shangri-La Boracay in December 2012, I had organised my wedding from London via emails and phone call to Zane who I had as the event coordinator. I was initially worried as I would not get to the venue a week before the wedding and had not been to Boracay before but all my family and friends who have been said it was a great holiday destination.
There are various wedding package you can choose depending on your budget.

From the moment I arrived at the front of the Shangri-la and saw the view I loved the place, it is secluded from the rest of the town. What makes it beautiful is that it feels like its been blended into nature with lots of trees and flowers and the villas are amazing and have spectacular views.
You never feel like it is over crowded, breakfast is amazing because there is so much choice. You can even have roast for breakfast.

As for my wedding I could not fault the service, the wedding coordinator was so good. She thought about things I had not thought of and was there when I needed her. I did not need a wedding coordinator. Staff were so helpful even when one of the groomsmen split his trousers they mended it there and then. They were there as soon as you needed help with anything.
The package may be a little more expensive than other hotels but it is worth it as they did everything to make my day perfect.
I would recommend this place for anyone who wants the perfect beach wedding, they will not let you down.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

It's location is far way from market, D'mall. They have shuttle bus to take you to d'mall every 30 minutes, and it is just 15 minutes drive, more or less.

Anyway, it's a very nice resort. The only bad thing is it cost USD 400++ a night.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This was truly one of our favorite family vacation spots. This resort is beautiful in every way. The resort is located in a secluded area with two beautiful beaches. You can walk to the end of the second beach and you will find another very private beach. There were no jellyfish which made it great for all of us to swim. The pool area was perfect as the kids had a lot of space to swim and we could see them from most of the lounging areas. The hotel also had a great kids club with adventure zone. Our kids played there daily to get a break from the sun. Take note, the kids need to wear socks to play and require long sleeve and long pants to go down the large slide. The staff in the kids club were fantastic as well as the other staff at the resort. Each morning the staff took the kids to feed the fish. Our favorite night spot was Serena. It was located on the cliff top and offered a happy hour, great view and fantastic food. Also, the hotel provided a free shuttle to D*Mall which is a shopping/restaurant area in town.

"After reading previous comments, I have little to add but am in total agreement of all the positive remarks made about this resort. My husband and I recently spent 5 nights honeymooning at the resort and the experience was amazing.

"“An imaginary remote paradise on earth; utopia”.

“A distant and secluded hideaway, usually of great beauty and peacefulness.”

These two definitions I researched are the perfect descriptions that best describe Shangri-la in Boracay Island. I am an Aklanon by blood (thanks to my parents) but a bakasyonista by fate since I was living in Negros Occidental and Boracay Island has been our getaway every summer when my Auntie tagged me and my cousins to help her during the Market Day in Catiklan during Sundays.

A short trip to the island was always something to look forward to during this time of the year. The early memories of the island were collecting corals drifted and sea shells, making sand castles and going back home with sun burns because only few cottages and lots of coconut trees inhabited this island (plus topless island hoppers as most of the tourists were billeted in Catiklan).

Last holy week was my latest visit to the island after a decade. The moment we touched down and proceeded to the arrival area, a man donned in regal red attire met us with the refreshing smile and ushered us straight to the van with pineapple juice. The aroma of Shangri-la met us right away while the hotel’s representative took care of our luggage.

The trip to Catiklan was short because we had wi-fi all throughout the trip. I paid a visit to my parents who were waiting for us for lunch in Ibajay, Aklan. When we reached the jetty port, the courteousness of Shangrila met us with Dalandan juice, this time. We stayed for about 15 minutes and we were ushered to “our” speed boat. What? I think I miss the usual motorized boat but it was fun and swift. When we passed by Balabag area, memories flashed like movie scenes.

Shangri-la has its own port and don’t miss looking down before you take your first step to the island. The water is so clear that you want to dive in. “Buggies” are waiting for the guests to bring them to their own villas. The buggies are similar to golf carts. They are everywhere just like the smiles of the staff.

We were brought straight to our villas without the usual hassle of talking to the front desk. This is one thing I really appreciated. We took Villa 11. The moment the gate opened, I could feel the rush raging…and omggggg, we had our own pool and a view of the ocean. I could not wait for my first dip but the daybed was something I could not ignore. The first day was all about lounging and lounging and talking and talking. No one took a dip yet. We were all in awe with the view. Well, wi-fi was strong (and anywhere in the area... i mean the resort but we all decided to close our tablets and ipads for a day.

After all the raging cells settled in, we decided to take a walk. The place is so serene and private that we inquired if all the rooms were occupied…it was 100% occupied. It was only at the pool areas where we see human beings. The bar in front of the beach was our place until midnight that we almost forgot we rented a villa.

Sunset! Yes…sunset on this part of the island was perfect: clear sea with no obstruction. The water is cold but the sand is not that powdery compared to the Balabag area. Although don’t expect for beautiful corals and colorful fish. You could hardly find one, but you can lounge on the beach with all the accommodation you need…a margarita or a mojito while basking with the view of the sunset.

The outdoor dinner was also recommendable but it was not the best. The food was ok but not really that memorable. And please don’t forget to check the entertainment area. OMG – they have almost everything an indoor sportsperson need- except the extreme one. Just something to shed off some weight you gain and the children to have fun too.

The place, in general, is more than beautiful. It is photogenic and it has stories to tell. The staff are accommodating and always wear smiles. In fact, the Shangri-la Boracay seems like an imaginary paradise with great beauty and peacefulness…something you need after partying in Station 2!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed there for 4days/3nights last january. Upon arrival at the airport, we were fetched by a bus that brought us to the wharf where their boat is waiting. The staff took care of our bags.

Upon arrival at the resort, We were really amazed with the beauty of the resort, and there were staff waiting for us at the arrival site. We were warmly welcomed. They have a cart that took us to the reception area where we were given free drinks and snacks. The view from the reception was superb, it has a view of the beautiful beach. It's very serene and breath taking.

The rooms are spacious, it has a king sized bed with an extra double bed. It could accomodate up to 4 people. I really love their bathroom, very spacious, the shower area is separated with the toilet area. They also have a bathtub. And I really love the L'occitane free toiletries that comes with the room.

Buffet Breakfast was superb, they have a lot of options, the area also have a beautiful view of the beach.

The resort is far from the d'mall but they offer a complementary ride if you want to go there, just take note of the schedule.

Their infinity pool is really inviting, it has a jacuzzi, we loved taking a swim in the pool, though the water was really cold at night time. The 2 private beaches that they have were really beautiful, they have chairs where you can have your tan.

"From the minute you land at Boracay Island the Shangri-La extend 5 star services in ensuring the stay is as comfortable as possible. The 15 minute speed boat ride over to the Shangri-La gives you a glimpse of the gorgeous island and what to expect during your stay. Shangri-La offers a private beach and a number of pools as well as world-class facilities. The rooms are amazing with views that are breathtaking, and the beach is just outside your doorstep. Patience is a must if you plan on staying here as the service is typical of what you expect from the Philippines- slow at best but can be overlooked by just gazing out to the beautiful crystal clear waters. The food is average in most of the restaurants, however the Solana has a seafood platter that is simply divine and should not be missed. The personnel at the hotel are very polite and always very friendly. For those with young children there a play land which is supervised and for those with teenagers an entertainment room with pool tables, Ping-Pong, computers and TV. It won't be a cheap holiday but if you can afford it, it's worth the expense and if you can really splurge get yourself a pool villa and see how the other half live..",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I'm writing this review from a beachside deck chair and are reflecting on my 4 days here.

Overall it's been an ok stay, not great or amazing, but adequate is the best word to describe it.

The ShangriLa is neither a honeymooners resort nor a good place for families. It lacks the intimacy, privacy and attention to detail you would expect for a romantic getaway, and the facilities/isolation from the town make it a poor choice for families. In summary, I'm confused as to what the target market is for the resort.

A couple of annoying problems to take note of ;

- Don't be fooled by the package rates online that include a ""room upgrade"". We booked this package only to be told on arrival no upgrades were available. No problem as they reverted our rate to the standard price, but that's not the point. I noticed plenty of suites available, so clearly the package should be ""upgrades available..... when it suits us"". I don't suppose they wanted to jump us 2 room categories.

- Despite asking for an early check in, our room wasn't available available until 2.30pm. Again no major problem however it took another hour plus 2 calls and a visit to reception to eventually get our bags. A small thing I know, but we didn't want to waste any beach time, so sitting in the room waiting for bags was annoying.

- The children's/teen activity centre is good, but it's not all free... Expect to pay extra for Xbox, PS2, Karaoke etc.

- The food at the hotel is average, and extremely expensive. We would have averaged AUD$150 most meals for 1 adult and 2 teenage kids.

- The shuttle bus to/from the town is frequently full which means at times you could be stranded for an hour.

- The breakfast service is an experience - large, noisy and very much a bargain cafeteria feel to it.

- The isolation from the town is a factor, and whilst some see this as a positive, I will be staying somewhere a little more central next time.

On a positive, the staff were very nice and well trained to make you feel welcome.

For the price it doesn't represent value for money.",Value for money:Staff:Food

A pretty large property with 100+ rooms... almost 7-8 different categories. We stayed in a deluxe seaview room. View from the balcony was serene.... private beach and the sea.

My son spent most of his time in resort at the kid activity room - plenty of things to keep the kids busy - from Billiards table to video games to books to puzzle games....

The resort provides the most amazing experience of this small tropical island. Various adventure activities are available with high safety standards.

This is the best hotel where you can stay in Boracay. its rate is justified by what you are getting if you stay here. about 15 mins ride to the main beach via van. food is superb!(buffet breakfast and at the italian resto on a treetop) definitely staying here when I visit Boracay again.,Food:Location
"We hoped and expected the Shangri-la Boracay to be one of the highlights of our trip. The property and grounds are fantastic and the staff is exceptionally friendly (i.e. you are immediately greeted with a sense of warmth and welcoming that makes the you very special). Our disappointed, however, was with the food and cold (water temperature) pool. Given the cost and star rating of this property we expected the food to be significantly better than what we experienced (the breakfast buffet was a solid ""B"", but the Korean BBQ a and Filipino/local food was pretty greasy as well as fatty). Some of the more positive highlights of the property include a first class game room for the kids and young adults (pool table/ping pong/Karaoke (private) room/etc.), private beach, and amazing ocean front views from most of the hotel rooms.

As far as the island, Boracay is simply growing faster than the local government can keep up (green slime/algae is found consistently on the beaches) and you should expect to find traffic in all forms and shapes. The Island reminds me of Cancun (after it started to get over-crowded) and is VERY touristy. Make sure to give yourself extra travel time to/from the airport as you must take a water taxi (private, provided by the Shangri-la (at a cost)) and should budget close to three hours. We left Boracay and went to Palawan (Palawan and El Nido = AMAZING!)",Food:Location:Value for money
"We just spent 4 days in a pool bungalow In Boracay and would highly recommend this place for a short beach getaway in Asia. In the past four years we have stayed at Amanpulo, Fourseasons Ko Samui, Four seasons Bali and Four seasons Kona and I would have to say the shangri-la is right up their with those top places to stay. Quality of beach front - Nothing could be as good as amanpulo, but SLBoracay comes close. There are two very nice swiming beaches the one side gets a bit crowded but the other there are very few people. In comparison Amanpulo has better beaches with no one on them. The beach at the Four seasons on Bali is unswimable and stinky, at Ko Samui Four seasons the beach looks great but is kind of hard to swim. On Kona at the four seasons you are swiming in a walled off piece of ocean. The bungalow at SLBoracay is huge, the bathroom is great and the pool attached to the villa with an outdoor shower is a great touch. In comparison the villas at Bali 4seasons probalby have a better fit and finish with some great bali craftwork built in. For the same price at the Kona Four seasons you just get a nice hotel room. The Amanpulo Villa we stayed in was very nice, but no pool attached for perhpas 50% more cost. All in all the villa at SLBoracay was perhpas a bit lower on the fit and finish than some others but still pretty nice. As for the resort pool hands down SLBoracay had the better pool than those other high end Asian resorts. Its a pool with lots of little private space. I do like the Kings pond at FS Kona a lot, but the other places FS Bali, FS Samui have relatively unintersting main pool areas....as for the food..not bad at the SLBoracay, but nothing special. To be honest there are 10 restaurants within 10 minutes walk of my house in Tokyo that have better food than any of these resort hotels. If you want good food, stay home..In conclusion I would say that if money is no object go for the Amanpulo. Otherwise I though the SLBoracay is better for a short beach holiday than FS Kona, FS Bali, or FS Koh Samui.....",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My wife and I chose this resort based on pictures, friends experiences, trip advisor feedback and Shangri La reputation. Our expectations were high and we were still blown away by our holiday experience.
We stayed 8 days and ventured outside the resort only once for a brief look at Boracay. We spent most of our holiday in a very comfortable cabana by the pool overlooking the beach and reading.
The facilities are excellent, the staff are amazing in their ability to be attentive and thoughtful without intruding. We are Sydney based and the restaurants to us offered very good value with high quality food at about half the price of an equivalent meal in Sydney. There were low priced options in each restaurant that were excellent value ranging from pizza to curries to top quality steak and lobster at still reasonable prices. The wines were similar prices to Sydney restaurants with a good range from a variety of countries. The beers are very cheap and I am a fan.
The breakfast buffet is the best we have seen with a wide choice reflecting the diverse mix of guests without any compromise to quality.
Although we did not bring our family the facilities for all ages of children from toddlers to teenagers are impressive. We will return with our family.",Food:Value for money
"Before we traveled to Boracay I did a lot of research on where to stay. The Shangri-la consistently come up number one. The only bad thing I found in the reviews was that someone once accidentally stepped into the water feature in the lobby. Having seen the water feature I now understand and having stayed at the shangri-la I now have no choice but to write a review saying its the best hotel I have ever stayed in.
We had one of the villas on the hill - the view was EXACTLY the same as in their promotional photos. Our butler was Anthony who was charming if not a bit bemused by our antics (we called him katut - Australians will understand the joke). The staff were warm and friendly and quickly adapted to the fact that myself and my travelling companions were not their average honeymooning couple.
The private beach was beautiful with good snorkelling directly off the beach and while we had our own pool in our villa we really enjoyed our time at the main pool and ate a lot of meals there.
The room was perfect in every way.
The one word of caution (in addition to the water feature in the lobby) is to ask if there is a wedding booked, or being prepared for during your stay. We had a day of pergola building and sound checks next to the pool which was really not what we wanted from our luxury holiday. That said, they managed us well when we complained.
I will never forget our ""movie star exit"" (resulting from flight changes leading to tight transfer times to the airport) in which we got whisked through security and checkin at the airport (after checkin had closed). A fitting way to depart paradise.
If you can afford this place - Go. If you can't - stop buying groceries and paying your bills, default on your mortgage and go anyway.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
"Of all the hotels/resorts that I have stayed at, Shangri-La Boracay is definitely the best one I've been to. While it is also the most expensive among all my past bookings as well(even at a promotional rate), it surely felt worth it considering the quality of service we experienced. The state of the property also shows that no expense was spared. As an example, even the receiving area at the Caticlan jetty port was good enough to beat other hotels' main check-in lobbies. Once we got there, everything was taken cared for. It really added to the relaxing mood. Three days and two nights seemed to go by so fast for us to make most of the resort, let alone the rest of the island!

Some specifics though: the property is on the tip of the island, giving it good privacy and exclusivity. However, there are drawbacks such as the sand on its beachfront is not the same as the world famous powder-fine sand of White Beach Boracay (middle part of the island). If you want to sink your toes into that, hitch a ride in the hourly complimentary shuttle to D'Mall (sort of the island's city center/market) and have a stroll there (and while you're at it, go get yourself some Jonah's fruitshake). Also, if you're going for the nightlife, the last shuttle back to the hotel is at 1am. Beyond that, you'll have to arrange transport with them (for a fee) or hire one of the tricycles from the main road (there are a lot, so this won't be a problem).

I rate myself as a novice when it comes to traveling. Much of my experience only started picking up the past few years and I look forward to seeing what more the world has to offer. After experiencing such a spectacular stay in Shangri-La Boracay, this will definitely be my benchmark in what vacations should be.",Value for money:Location:Food
"From the moment we landed to the time we left, nothing but absolute excellence. I can't say enough about this resort hotel that has not been mentioned by previous reviewers. The views from the hotel is simply magnificent. Having breakfast overlooking the beach is simply amazing. We did venture out to D'Mall and found it to be too crowded but that is where you'll find all sorts of adventure but for us having this ""alone time"" is more important. The gym is complete with all types of machines and free weights. We had a blast at the entertainment center, played billiards, ping pong, and air hockey. We even rented one of the karaoke rooms for a mere $17.50 which includes 3 drinks and a calamari dish. We were lucky that we stayed during the week as the private beach was not crowded at all. Our seaview room was on the 5th floor so our view was unobstructed by tall palm trees. My only regret is that we only stayed for 2 nights...not nearly enough to enjoy what the hotel has to offer. The cost is a little pricey for us but was worth every penny. I would highly recommend this hotel to experience Boracay for the very first time.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We enjoyed very much our four days here. The resort is really beautiful and luxurious. Our room, the one with a garden view, was huge, around 60 square meters.
The hotel has two private beaches that are way more peaceful than the crowded White Sand beach. It also has many different and large infinity pools in the garden.
The shuttle service to and from D'Mall worked well during our stay and we never had to wait long for their van.
Hotel's staff was nice and easygoing and breakfast OK. They really worked hard to serve nothing but the best. Couple of times we saw the head chef walking a around the restaurant. Once he took OJ back to kitchen after he had tasted it.
Only small letdown was the cutlery that felt plastic. And, of course, checking out and leaving the place wasn't that nice either. :) We could had stayed longer, and we can highly recommend to choose this luxurious heaven. This is, no doubt, the best hotel we have been to.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We have stayed there for four nights. I've got to say it really is nice resort but i was surprised how crowded it was. Coming here after staying in resorts where you haven't met a person for a whole day time it was kind of unpleasant. The room was quite spacious, nicely furnished, very clean, with great amenities, great amount of tv channels, daily two bottles of water and fresh fruits, daybeds on the balcony. We did not like the toilet - such a small space that even the shorter one of us (173cm) almost did not fit in and we also missed an espresso machine (which i guess is a norm at the hotels of this level). We really loved their breakfasts - enormous amount of choices (anything you can imagine) but it was always really crowded and queueing was not an exception. One thing we didn't like at all - though it's a thing the resort can do nothing about - and that was the amount of food the guests were throwing away (there literally were plates full of food thrown away - I've never seen it done to this extent anywhere else). All the other dining was excellent as well - we went for the philippino buffet which was amazing. On the other hand the lobby bar was quite an unpleasant surprise for us - we were waiting for a long time to get the drinks even though it was almost empty and the drinks were nothing like they should be - no garnish, half empty glass, warm Margarita. Great plus were the free shuttle busses from the resort to the town (but again - crowds and queues). Check in and check out were both really fast, the staff at the restaurants, front desk, beach, spa was extremely nice and helpfull. I would give excellent rating if only it wasn't for the lobby bar and the crowds which kind of spoiled the experience for us.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Amazing service, this hotel seems to be the best by far on the island.
A little too busy for my liking but it was Chinese New Year so was expected.
The location is quiet and out of the way which I liked. The beach/water is very nice. Super clear water and you can do some snorkeling off the beach, although not much to see.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This is probably the most luxurious and expensive resort on the island, and it is not too hard to understand why. The moment you arrive at Caticlan airport, you do get some kind of a “VIP treatment”. You are whisked away to Shangri-la’s own jetty and waiting lounge on its van, less than 5 minutes’ drive away. There, you wait in comfort for the Shangri-la boat to arrive while everyone else is queuing up for the bumboats only in the next building. Needless to say, the Shangri-la boats are also more comfortable and faster than the other overcrowded-looking bumboats.

The boat ride to Shangri-la resort, which is on the far end of Boracay island, is about 15 minutes long. While slightly bumpy when the sea is choppy, you do feel that you are already much better off than the other people crammed in the bumboats to the island. There you arrive at the jetty in the resort, and there you have a buggy waiting to bring you and your belongings to the lobby.

We stayed in the Seaview Suite, which was very spacious and had its own jacuzzi on the balcony. It faces the sea, and was great for watching the sunset. The only drawback was, however, that the suites are located on the lowest level, so views of the sea and beach are partially obstructed by the trees.

There is the usual Shangri-la level of luxury and comfort in the room—definitely very comfortable with touches of luxury and attention to detail. However, I personally felt it was a little too clinical for a beach resort of its level. Except for the day bed and jacuzzi on the balcony, almost everything else in the room would probably not look out of place in a business hotel in the city. For the price and the location, I was expecting some kind of additional surprises to make it more unique. Perhaps the corporate branding executives had very strong ideas of conformance with the group’s brand identity.

The hotel grounds were well-maintained, and there were some nice touches to ensure people enjoy their holidays. The beaches were great, with beautiful views of the sunset. There was a saltwater infinity pool which also had great views of the sea, especially in the evenings. However, we might not have been able to enjoy this pool if we could not swim, as it was very deep. While the other 2 pools in the resort were larger and had more features like fountains and greenery etc, we thought that the view was best from this one, and naturally we spent the greatest amount of time in this one.

We also appreciated the Entertainment Centre, where guests could enjoy games like foosball, pool, shooting hoops, table tennis, board games etc, use the computer, or watch TV programmes on the projector screen at no extra cost. The Fitness Centre has the standard amenities and equipment that are present in most Shangri-la properties—good enough for regular gym-goers like us. We thought it was nice that they even loaned shoes to guests who did not have suitable shoes with them.

The spa did not disappoint. It occupied an expansive portion of the resort premises, and had its own swimming pool and jacuzzi. The spa treatments were done in little huts in the spa compound—rather cosy with the right touch of privacy. As expected of the Chi Spa in Shangri-la, prices are never cheap. The spa was a very peaceful area in the resort. When we went in the evening, we might have been the only guests in the spa, as we did not see anyone else there. The spa also has its own buggy to transport guests between their rooms and the spa.

In terms of location, Shangri-la is tucked in a corner on the island. It feels very exclusive, as there is not much traffic at this end of the island. The drawback, however, is that it takes some time to travel between the resort to D’Mall, where most of the shops, eateries and activity centres on the island are located. There is also a nice beach with white sand near D’Mall, but we preferred the ones in Shangri-la as these were much less crowded. The resort provides an hourly shuttle to and from D’Mall.

Service was what one would expect from Shangri-la. Staff were well-trained and knew what to do and what to say in almost every situation. There was a good attention to detail. However, again, I felt that this being a beach resort, service was a tad too clinical for my liking again. I wouldn’t be surprised if the staff had scripts to follow for every foreseeable situation during the course of duty. When everyone is there to relax and enjoy a vacation, perhaps staff could be allowed more leeway to be less uptight and be casual, instead of adhering to the SOP in almost every instance?

I had a somewhat disappointing experience though. On one of the afternoons when I was out taking pictures with my wife on the beach, one of the parts of my gorillapod fell off without our realising it. I knew it must have fallen off in the area between the two beaches, as I had last used it at one end of a beach, and realised it had fallen off when I wanted to use it again when I reached the other beach. When we searched the area on our own, it was no longer there, and we figured perhaps the employees who were setting up tables for dinner in that area had thought it was a piece of rubbish and disposed of it promptly. It is otherwise hard to imagine that a large piece of equipment measuring one foot long could disappear within 5 minutes.

I then checked with one of the gentlemen who was there, asking if he or any of his colleagues had picked it up, showing him what it looks like. He promised he would alert everyone working in the area to look out for it, and send it to my room once it was found. A couple of hours later when I called back to check, it appeared that this employee had not bothered to follow up on the matter as no other person was aware of it (maybe this was not in the SOP or service scripts). By then it was dark, and the few people who were sent out to hunt for it could not find it, and the rubbish bags had probably been removed. I never got the item back.

In all, I think this is a good resort, and most people would probably have few complaints. The VIP treatment extends past check out, when staff at the jetty accompany you all the way to the airport and assist with checking in for your flight. There is also a Shangri-la lounge in the Caticlan Airport’s Departure Lounge, which ensures you are comfortable until you board the plane. However, the experience does not come cheap, and whether it is worth the price is open to debate.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"You could easily spend a day or two just inside the premises of this resort. Beautiful private beach (although the sand isn't as powdery as the one on the main beach at D'Mall area), beautiful pools and beautiful rooms. They also have a free shuttle service to D'Mall which is very convenient. Staff was friendly and service was good. Rooms were very spacious and clean.

Tips: Reserve a cabana at the Solana Restaurant for sunset watching as it gets fully booked fast. Or visit after dinner, like what me and my husband did! (Some photos of how it looks at night: http://bit.ly/11M4f0d) Another tip: during the morning, when they're not as busy, ask if one of the buggy drivers can drive you around the resort and give you a tour! It was nice to see how the different villas looked!

Only complaint (which is a minor one) was how during breakfast, there didn't seem to be enough waiters for everyone. We asked three different waiters for our water to be refilled but nobody came: I guess they were all too busy (so we just went up to the juice bar)

Enjoyed my stay so much, I didn't want to leave!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

Shangri-La Boracay is large and there are a lot of guests, however, by staying in Villa 13 we got a totally different experience. It was like we were on a private island with the 5 star service that comes from the Shangri-La.

Now although i did not stay at this resort I did go looking for some beach and cocktails. We finally got there around 4pm went down to the beach only to be told we could not use it unless we brought a day pass and they close the beach area at 6pm. The day pass was $70 which for 2 hours. They refused to negotiate even though there was a big group of us who were quite willing to buy food and drinks. Not impressed at all,Food:Value for money:Location

Helpful crew and staff make the transition as easy as it can get. Food of various cost and type is available at several places within the hotel complex.

When you arrive it, you will see an spectacular hotel. And all the staff are very nice and kindly people. It is the best hotel to stay in Boracay.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We stayed here for three nights at the end of our Boracay stay, wow what a difference a hotel makes. This is a haven of peace and tranquility, service is top notch and breakfast is great. We had a wonderful sea view, room (Deluxe Sea View)was a little small but fine and pleasant. Restaurants were fairly good, and the grounds and beach are perfect.

One thing that was a little difficult to get my head around, having stayed in the middle of White beach (Station 2 – Don't do it :))) for some nights before, was that on arrival they present you with a voucher for a special price massage, only if you use it within 24 hours of your arrival, this special price was 10 times the normal price of a massage on Boracay, yes the special deal of one for the price of l0!! I think it is unnecessary for Shangri La to try to trick you into getting a massage quickly there before you find out how much they are outside the hotel. I know it might be said that there massages are better than outside, but I seriously doubt it. I didn't find out though :)))

I would recommend anyone thinking of going to Boracay and only staying here for a couple of nights, to make it so they stay her for their last night, the transfer to the airport is incredible (you might want to stay for your first night too:)) it goes like this: I called for someone to get my luggage (I had already settled the bill earlier in the day- I would recommend this as you pass the lobby), two men turned up, collected the luggage and us and escorted us to a golf buggy, which then drove us for two minutes to the private jetty at the hotel beach, to a waiting boat, then a 10 minute pleasant boat ride to the mainland boat terminal for Caticlan airport, we were then escorted 10 steps to the private Shangri La lounge at the boat port, we were asked for our air ticket information in the this lounge, then asked to get into the waiting mini bus for the two minute journey to the airport, the luggage had already been transferred to the mini bus for us, on arrival at the airport security had already been advised of our arrival and given the flight information, we cleared security and another member of Shangri la staff was at the airport desk and the airline was ready to check us in with all information been handed over before our arrival, We had excess baggage, so the Shangri La staff too k the money off me and went and dealt with the payment, then whisked up stairs to the Shangri La private lounge in the airport! Wow what a slick process!! Well done!!! the only criticism I could make about this was that it was so slick that we arrived in the terminal ready for our flight far too early, you literally need twenty minutes from your hotel room to the time you want to be in the Airport. It was fantastic, especially when compared to how one needs to get to the airport from Boracay normally.

Transport around the Island is not so slick I'm afraid, the free shuttle to D Mall is hourly most of the day and every 30 minutes at peak times, but at some peak times this isn't enough and there is a queue (line for the Americans reading this) that fills the mini bus up which make you wait another 30 mins for the next one, they need to work on this! They have enough staff there to do an on demand service I am sure. Also when I booked I was at another hotel, they said they would collect us in 15 minutes, 40 minutes later they still had not arrived, I called and they said it would be another 5-10 minutes, 15 minutes after that the hotel I was at received a phone call saying it would be at least another 15 minutes, this was at dinner time and we were hungry and fed up with waiting so we arranged a trike and made our own way there, I looked out for a Shangri Mini bus the whole way but did not see one coming to get us, when I complained at checkin they said that the mini bus was there to pick us up 2 mins after we left!!!

The resort is really huge with lots of nice spots to look at the beautiful landscape and beaches. Chilling out at the private beach was nice and security's tight. The breakfast buffet was really sumptuous and it's really family friendly with a low buffet counter for kids. The view from my room was awesome, unlike some beach resorts we didn't have to worry about mosquitoes. Try the mangoes there, really sweet.

"Hospitality of SLBO's staff is topnotch. All of them are well trained.

We checked in January 9. We chose to land at Kalibo since we still prefer big airplanes compared to small airplanes of Caticlan. From the time we landed at Kalibo, there's already a staff from Shangri-la who welcomed us in Kalibo, and escorted s to our van. We paid 3,500php for our van transfer which is good for 8 people. The van is from Southwest and we had it all to ourselves. Then on our arrival at Shangri-la's port their staff greeted us with welcome drinks and fresh towels. The port also has free wifi. Then it didn't take long for us to be escorted to their speedboat. And we enjoyed our ride to the hotel.

Their rooms are clean and basic supplies areavailable. I was very delighted to see hair band available, since i didn't bring one and it's going to be useful during activities. It's also very spacious and wifi is very fast anywhere in the area. Complimentary fruits everyday are also something to look forward to. Each night they visit rooms to fix the sheets and prepare them before the guests sleep. Some supplies are also replenished at night.

Entertainment area is something anyone would enjoy spending time at. Kids would also enjoy adventure room where they can play at. And, the gym is also very neat. Using the gym is free and it is equipped with jacuzzi, sauna, and steambath. Free shuttle to d'mall is also available every 15mins and sometimes even less.

Complimentary breakfast is also delicious. From rice to noodles, american to oriental options are available. Pastries are fresh as well.

At d'mall we tried to arrange for zorb ball and it took us 3 hours just to wait for the ride. We decided to arrange activities at shangri-la and we regret that we wasted 3 hous at d'mall just for the zorb when it actually took minutes for us to arrange this at shangri-la.

"We paid a fortune for our 17 nights in Shangri-La Boracay during Christmas New Year period, but all I can say is every single cent was worth spending.
It took us 18 hours to travel from our home in Melbourne to the resort in Boracay. By the time we got to Kalibo airport we were already exhausted. The welcoming and helpful airport pick up staff put our minds at rest. He collected our luggages and directed us to the hotel mini van, which took us to Shangri-la's private jetty in comfort. The speed boat trip was rocky, however when I saw the resort appeared behind the long busy main beach, I knew we arrived at paradise. Everything was well taken care of and we had our best holiday ever. Trust me, I am not a easy to please traveler.
We were assigned to a top floor corner room which over looked the semi-private beach. We observed beach wedding preparations during the day (December is the wedding month on the island) and learnt how to build sand castles from the professional; and enjoyed the famous Shangri-La sunsets int he evening.
During our stay we spent only a handful of days outside of the resort and we were glad that we had such a piece of heaven to hide away. Besides scuba diving lessons and spa sessions, relaxing on the private beach is our favourite activities. Jeson is the most enthusiastic waiting staff I have ever met. He greeted us everyday with his signature warm smile, and made sure we were serviced. Neil from Alon Bar is the dream bar tender of every hotel. He ran into us in town during his day off and spent an afternoon showing us around the island. His passion and friendliness was definitely hard to resist.

Anyway the resort has its own transfer from the airport in Caticlan and for those wonderful 3 nights and 4 days I decided to forget the world and its was well worth whatever my parents spent.

"I stayed in Discovery Suites before and also liked it as it is located right on the main stretch of white sand beach. However, I still feel that Shangri-la Boracay is more comparable to the nice resorts in Bali, Hawaii and Phuket (i.e., Westin, Sheraton, Grand Hyatt). It is well landscaped and very private.

Service at the Chi can be better. I'm not sure if it is because we were the last guests for the day. I was not satisfied with the treatment, attitude and ambiance. Had better experiences in other Chi's.

The check-in and waiting staff do their best to please you. Concierge even contacted someone at D'Mall to physically make a restaurant reservation for us when they couldn't get through their phone line. Buffet breakfast is extensive and dining areas are nice. The health club looks nice as well. If you are coming with children, you will enjoy Shangri-la.

At the beach, you can see school of fishes. They call them ""rock fish"". Water is murkier and beach is not fine white sand. Overall, we enjoyed our stay.",Food:Location
"I chose this hotel because of the good reviews it got in tripadvisor.
I am really not fussy as you see in my other reviews but this was not as we had hoped for.
The good things are: the transfer from airport to hotel is very well organized, their welcome center is great. Our villa balani was outstanding and very well equipped, but I guess at 1200 euro per night one can expect that. The hotel is beautiful and the 2 beaches are Devine. Guests are a nice mixture of nationalities.. Staff is friendly. Food in rima and all Italian options are good,I think the f and b manager is Italian.
Kids club and staff were nice and professional
Spa was fantastic
Now comes the big list of cons:
The worst thing is the incapable service provided by almost everyone of the staff. Almost every order has to said 2 or three times. Breakfast order to the room never came complete. Service at the beach is a nightmare. Everyone seems to be willing and ins friendly but the system of ordering is too confused or I don't know. No order arrived on time, and I saw other guests at the beach complaining aswell about the unprofessional and very slow arrival of food. Even the general manager wanted to send us a few options of transfers to Manila to the room and it failed to ever arrive. If you travel to this resort you have to organize yourself, don't try to reach the concierge, other they don't pick up the phone or they want to call you back. It could be just too manly guests that they can't handle, but again if you pay the price we did you expect everything to run very smooth.
Food also did not rock I must say. Lobster in sirena tasted old,orange juice was empty and not refilled before bfast was over, ran out of oranges! Variety of Buffett in main restaurant was poor, taste of the things was good though.
Lounges at the beach were not enough, we had to fight every day to find to lounges with an umbrella. Just too much hassle!

We enjoyed the restaurants on the property, and especially loved the two-for-one happy hour at the bar by the beach. We never wanted to leave - the Shangri-La was perfect!",Food:Location:Staff
"I have been living in Manila for the past year, and I visited this Shangri-La property twice. I am well traveled in the country and I can say that Shangri-La Boracay is as good as luxury gets in the Philippines.
My friend and I stayed in the Delux Seaview Rooms. Rooms are spacious and comfortable.
The trip from Caticlan Airport is pleasant and easy as the resort has private vans and boat that dock at the resort directly, without passing through White Beach.
Definitely a five-star property.
The private beach makes the place very relaxing. Sand is white, although not as powdery as White Beach's sand. However, the privacy makes up for the natural beauty.

I would recommend to try:
1. Chi Spa - The treatments are amazing, they are administered in separate huts and using the Spa gives access to the Spa pool and zen garden, that are quite amazing. Go in a couple to get better value for money.
2. Rima restaurant - It's an Italian restaurant in the property. The food is authentic and delicious. I found desserts over-sized to be the perfect conclusion of the meal, but you don't have to order one, as the kitchen offers cookies and truffles to end the meal.

Service is possibly below what one would expect from a 5-stars establishment. Not too bad to ruin your stay, but be prepared to follow up on your orders!

Another thing that I did not like is that beach/sea sport equipment is only for rent at a high price. I would expect this kind of resorts to be able to provide it for free to guests.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I visited Shangri La last Saturday night for dinner - started off with some drinks at the main lobby bar which was nice then went for dinner at their Italian restaurant which is where the whole experience fell apart. I ordered the Foie Gras which was so tiny i could hardly see it (basically a tea spoon full at best) followed by the duck which was so horrible over cooked i had to send it back. It was so tough i literally could not chew it.

I've been to Boracay 3 times now and each time the resort food had been rubbish and we had to go somewhere else to get something decent to eat.

If you are looking for decent food with your holiday go somewhere else....",Food
"Shangri-la Boracay is just about perfect. The hotel itself is incredible, the only thing worth considering is that it does feel quite remote and private - if this is what you're after, great. But if you want to be in the thick of Boracay maybe not the best choice. The beach is not as nice as White Beach so we stayed on White Beach for most of our holiday and then relaxed here for a few days. We've stayed in a pool villa, and also a tree house villa - the view from these rooms is amazing as are the rooms themselves. Like a house that you want to move in too! The food was the best we had on the island, and the people are lovely.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"It is almost unbelievable, that it hotels on the world returns, where also nothing to complain about is.
shangri-la boracay is quite simply one of the most outstanding resorts in existence. boracay is a beautiful island but when it comes to accommodation there really is no second option. white beach is nice and the sand is beautiful and water as clear as water can be but it does lack privacy which the shangri-la provides in abundance. the pool is simply a work of art and its own private secluded beach is the prefect place to relax and take in the rays.The rooms each of its kind more than good equipped and offer maximum comfort. The view to the beach in the evening leaves you dream. The food in its quality and taste are not to beat.
we can only say, do you think not, but visit this place and they want never again way.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"The location of the hotel is absolutely perfect. It has the most fantastic private beach, and the water is really similar to the Maldives - warm and so clean. The resort facilities are fantastic and there is so much on offer. Several restaurants to chose from and we tried all of them and all were great. I will definately be going back to this place...",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"From the moment you arrive at the dock, until the end, the service is first rate. Everyone at the hotel is eager to help and at your service 24/7. Cannot forget how wonderful their smiles are and how they made us forget about your worries. Our kids loved the pool and the beach is excellent. Although the island has a public beach that has the ""talcum-powder""like sand, the private treatment you get at the Shangri-la is just perfect. The color of water is so pretty, I couldn't help it but to click away my camera. The transfer service is also, excellent even towards the end. The attendants from the hotel made sure we are all ready to go until we entered the security check. We arrived at Manila and found out then, that our luggage was handled priority, despite our economy seats. That's some detail-oriented service! We are definitely visiting the place again and would stongly recommend Shangri-la Boracay.",Staff
"This resort, tucked away in a secluded part of Boracay, is spectacular. I was very impressed and highly recommend it. The resort offers a private beach, and the swimming in the clear, blue water was glorious. There are many activites through the resort or available outside the resort so there is plenty to do. Also, the resort offers a shuttle to the famous White Sand Beach which offers shopping, restaurants, bars and good people watching.

If possible, fly into Caticlan Airport, the closer of the two airports (the other is an hours dirve away, but it is a larger more modern airport). From Caticlan, it is a quick drive to the boat terminal,and then a beautiful ten minute motor boat ride to the hotel's jetty",Location:Food
"Shangri-la Boracay is the best among the chain's hotels/resorts in the country! The prices are really steep, and from the time you arrive at the airport, you'll know why:

ARRIVAL. You are greeted by staff, your luggage is taken care of, and you are ushered to their cozy lounge where you are offered welcome refreshments while you wait for your private speedboat. One of our primary considerations in choosing this resort is because guests are transported from Caticlan to Boracay via a private speedboat equipped with life vests, and we needed to ensure that transport is safe, since we were traveling with an infant.

ROOM, AMENITIES. Exquisite!!! The resort is vast and grand, a luscious tropical paradise indeed. The grounds, roads, and conference facilities are topnotch, and always evoking that restful ambience. We booked a deluxe room with a seaview on the same floor as the reception area [4th floor]. It was very spacious, and it opened into a balcony/veranda with lounging beds and a view of the sea, of course. Aside from the king sized bed, there was a sofa bed that could accommodate 2 persons. The bathroom was likewise very spacious. We were even welcomed with cookies and milk in the room, because we had a child with us. With a room this cozy and beautiful, you get really torn between staying in all day, and frolicking in the beach/pool.

There are different kinds of rooms and villas in the resort. Some are 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom villas with their own pool and access to the beach -- totally grand, but will cost an arm, a leg, and then some more.

The infinity pool is a few steps away from the private beach. The sand in this private beach, though, is not as powdery as it is on White Beach [the main strip], but the exclusivity more than makes up for it.

RESTAURANTS. Food is the only ""letdown"", as it does not live up to the Shangrila standard that we are used to. The restaurants, esp. the buffet spreads at Shangrila Edsa [HEAT] and Makati [CIRCLES] in Manila, and Shangrila Mactan, are exemplary, while Shangrila Boracay's Vintana pales in comparison.

SERVICE. Outstanding, as expected.

LOCATION. The resort is somewhat secluded, a 15-20 minute drive from white beach station 1. Although the resort offers a complimentary shuttle going to/coming from D' Mall/White Beach/Station 2, there are specific times only. Considering the very steep price of this resort, transport service should be available to guests anytime [at reasonable hours], without having to be rushed or to wait for an hour to make it to the shuttle. [In contrast, Discovery Shores, the other 5-star resort on the island, offers complimentary transport service to its guests anytime, anywhere!]. The resort's location means that it is private and secluded, but that it is also far from where the action is, far from all the restaurants and shops. If you're a foodie, too bad, you're stuck with rather mediocre hotel fare for the rest of your stay, unless you leave the resort at mealtime to meander and sample the myriad dining options on White Beach. So the resort's location can be a boon or a bane, depending on what you are in Boracay for.

Overall, the resort is exquisite, the staff are warm and attentive, the service is great, the food is a bit of a letdown, the location is plus or a minus depending on your purposes. Would i book in this resort again? Hmm, if there's a promo or the rates get considerably lower and i can keep my arm and leg, perhaps. Would i recommend this to friends? To rich honeymooners or those who want utter privacy and tranquility and don't care much about bar/restaurant-hopping on the main beach, yes.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This is a fantastic beach resort with the experience starting with the efficient and comfortable transfers from the airport to resort . Has a beautiful setting set into the hillside facing West over the ocean perfect for sunset cocktails. The two beaches the resort is set on are beautiful - one private beach and one shared with other resorts,both with the powder white sands, crystal clear waters and lake like ocean of Boracay. The one private beach does get a little busy on weekends at which times the larger shared beach offered a quieter option, both beaches are substantially quieter than the main Boracay beach. The large complex of pools also offers a good alternative. The gym on site is well equipped and offers yoga classes, didnt try the spa. Kids are well catered for .They were supplied kids robes and slippers in the room and the kids club and entertainment centre with free amusements kept them well entertained. Restaurants are ok but not great and a little expensive but shuttle bus to nearby restaurant options is available. The cocktails in the beachside bar were brilliant especially during the 2 for 1 happy hour. The breakfast buffet was excellent. Stayed in family room with large balcony with day bed overlooking the ocean . Room was comfortable, clean , well maintained and generous size for 2 adults and 2 kids. Staff throughout were extremely friendly, the best we have encountered anywhere in the Philippines. Was a little expensive but well worth the price. We plan to return.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"We traveled from Iloilo City by private vehicle and was pleasantly surprised that they take care of you from the moment you arrive by having a free valet parking. We took their speedboat with just the 2 of us both ways. I guess we were lucky that we're the only ones traveling those times. Service is great; rooms are fantastic; free bottled water everywhere and offered; well designed layout that provides lots of privacy including their swimming pools; 2 beaches to choose from and again are quite private. Staff eager to please. Overall, great 2-nights getaway. Food could be better though if one compares it with Shangrila Mactan. We go to Boracay often so this time we just stayed in and enjoyed the hotel facilities and surroundings. Will try the loft villas next time.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"from the moment you arrive or depart , either via kalibo (longer route ) or caticlan airport, expect a shangri-la representative in decent uniform to assist in any which way possible its own guests to the resort ( that is inspite we made our separate booking for private van transfer ). from there we were led to an exclusive waiting lounge (nice chi spa scent ) in which they provide us drinks , from which our group was whisked to the resort via speedboat in about 5-10 minutes. This resort is definitely 5 star in quality . Everything here is beautiful , quite a huge property that several times we need a buggy cart (driven by its staff ) to bring us where we would like to go. The room that we booked (under my spouse name ) was spacious , comfortable and very functional . I liked the terrace day bed , separate tub and bathroom which has piped in sound .I also liked the huge flat screen wall mounted tv which has many channels. There are 2 private beach and an inifinity pool within the resort . Buffet breakfast served at its coffeeshop offers very extensive choices, with varying cuisine (it even has its own improvised kiddie corner buffet table ). Never got to try the vaunted chi spa. We have tried the bar by the beach, buffet restaurant Vintana (their fish and chips are one of the best i've tasted ) , and Solana ( nice for picture taking) and i would highly recommend them for the food and service . This property reminds me of Grand Hyatt Bali , but something this would would definitely excel is the service and friendliness of the overwhelming majority of the staff .The public places in this resort would exude a pleasant smell and aroma that somehow made me felt refreshed. I was aware of the long distance going to station 1 and 2 (which is the central part of where the happening is ) , but they provide hourly van service , which they adjust to every half hour during evenings , so that guest care would not be compromised. Staying in this place is good for special occasion like birthday, anniversary , and honeymoon although it would be better that big group parties or those in team building activities would not be conducted because they could be annoying . So if budget is not a problem , i would recommend a stay in this hotel even for once in a lifetime during a visit to Boracay (aside from Discovery Shores in station 1) .",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"This is the first time i have stayed in this property, the only thing the makes this a five star hotel is the people they are friendly willing to help and the food, I feel the security is an over kill too much security around makes me feel safe but questioning the safety of the property, will something go wrong if all the security is not around, what i hate about this property is the Beach poor quality feels like man made sand is not soft like in station one, long wait to get to D mall or even your own Villa. Rooms are not properly insulated from Noise so sleep quality is low, food is excellent at Seryna. 5 stars for the People & Food, 2-3 stars for Transportation, Room and Beach Quality",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Value for money
"My expectations were high. The property was nice - private beach, large pool area, good restaurant options. The rooms were mediocre - clean and inclusive of what you need, but not particularly stylish or special. The buffet breakfast had many options with good quality, but had the ambiance of a group-tour restaurant stop. The staff were friendly (especially in the restaurant) but could use customer service training. During our five night stay, we ran into a few problems. Air conditioning breaking down, cleaning staff attempting to enter at 6:30am and despite being asked to return later, they never did... these were minor disturbances.
Neighboring guests leaning over the balcony to peek in our room is out of the hotel's control, however guests blaring music and howling off their balcony at 4am is within their control! After calling the front desk more than once, it was suggested to PACK and move to a new room. Leaving belongings in the room until a decent hour was not an option. A complimentary drink or meal for the inconvenience was not even considered.

All in all, not a relaxing stay. After returning home I wrote feedback to the hotel 3 times (direct and website) before being acknowledged - they offered a one night stay at the same resort as compensation for the two interrupted sleeps. For the time, money and effort, I will stay elsewhere.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"After travelling around Philippines we decided for some R and R was appropriate so we booked a 4 day package to Boracay Island and the Shangri - la with its own private beach .
What a marvellous place away from the hustle and bustle. It is the best place we have ever stayed from the friendly staff to the resort grounds and the sea-.view room over looking the ocean it was just the best.
Buffet breakfast was exceptional. A courtesy bus runs at different times during the day to the mall and a small tourist market.
Yes, the resort is on the expensive side but it worth every penny. We were so so disappointed when we had to leave.",Value for money:Food:Location
"A wonderful experience, if you want to treat yourself to something memorable. Boracay is a beautiful island, but unfortunately overrun by tourists.. The Shangri-la on the other hand, saves the day. The ambience is fantastic! After spending the day exploring the island, you can just let yourself totally relax by the pool or on the one of their private coves. Don't forget to catch the sunset on the beach. Very romantic. For children, there is a million activities to keep them busy. and the best part? THE SPA!!!! omg. treat yourselves to a massage. It is so worth it.",Location
"The water in Boracay really is the colour that is depicted in photographs, the beaches are really like stepping on fine sifted sand (through the finest sifter), and this Hotel is as perfect as it looks. There are so many descriptive comments on here that I have little to add. The staff in every corner of this Hotel is simply outstanding. The rooms are very spacious, with a day bed on the private terrace, the small important details were there like mangos and rambutans in the fruit basket daily, to keep up your vitamin intake. A bed to lull you into the best sleep, everything was so clean, the tropical fragrance lingered everywhere. The bathroom was huge. The spa was heaven. I am sure that when I next go to a beach nothing will compare to the clearest water and the softest sand in the world or the genuine friendly staff in this Hotel and the local people in Boracay. A place in a million!",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness:Staff
"We spent a fantastic week here during the October Week holiday and I would gladly come back again some day!
Getting there from Shanghai is definitely a hassle with the overnighter in Manila, the early morning flight to Kalibo, the 2 hour drive to Caticlan and the ferry to the resort - certainly takes a day off your vacation. Probably better to fly directly to Caticlan from Manila but I think the flight to Kalibo was part of the reason for our good deal.
Mother nature certainly tested us with 2 days of solid rain and some bigger then usual swells in the ocean but we came to relax and even just swimming in the pool in the rain, going into D'mall to explore or watching movies in our room was a nice change of pace from work and school!
Our Ocean-view room met expectations and had a comfortable king sized bed, a pull out for my 10 year-old (you couldn't fit more then 1 kid on there) and a good shower, etc.

Beach Review: The 2 beaches are very nice, the private one being a touch rockier since it was essentially made of ground up seashells, while the semi-private one felt more private with less people hanging out there and softer sand. When the ocean is behaving you can snorkel right off the beach and many people did - I suggest bringing your own so you can go any time. Nothing though beats the absolutely incredible White Beach in town. Wow! I am a beach lover and have been to beaches all over the world and that one is warm, super soft, super clear and easily competes with beaches in the Caribbean, Mauritius, Bali, Thailand and more. Really spectacular to hang out in. A little more challenging to swim in since it is shallow quite far out and there is a lot of public beach activity in the form of boats, kite surfers and more.
Service at the Shangri La beach was wonderful with staff finding seats for us every morning and setting us up with towels and bringing complimentary bottles of water throughout the day. The chairs are super comfy as well!

F&B: What the Shangri La does fantastically well is breakfast! Really fantastic! The best French Toast I have ever tasted and the chocolatiest Pain Au Chocolat I have ever tasted! Really terrific pastry selection, ice cream for breakfast (?), a cute children's buffet with some odd breakfast selections (sometimes spaghetti, chicken wings and chicken soup to go along with cupcakes, tiny cookies, etc.). Of course they also have lots of regular Western and Asian regular breakfast selections.
While we only got lunch on the beach the dinners were more of a disappointment. We ate at the various buffets that they had and it felt like a much smaller selection then what was offered at breakfast and one time they were so overwhelmed by the numbers of guests they were struggling to keep up with putting out enough food. Only other restaurant we tried was for dessert one night at the place which had lovely sitting areas outside which were very private.

Overall, a beautiful spot and really great service. Not difficult to head out into D'mall with the shuttle or a tricycle to catch dinner on the beach (a much more varied and better priced option). Did the job of being super relaxing - would love to come back someday and had it not been for the sometimes disappointing dinners this hotel would have earned a 5 star from this family!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Words can't describe the experience my gf and I had @ Shangri-la Boracay. From the moment we arrived @ the airport, the staff took care of us very very well.

They have staff waiting for you @ both Kalibo and Caticlan Airport. From Kalibo, you need to take a 90-120 min shuttle ride to Caticlan sea port. You can arrange this with Shangri-la when you reserve your room. Shuttle by Shangri-la will cost you 3500 PHP per vehicle (a very good option if have a several ppl in ur grp). Otherwise, @ Kalibo airport, there are several commercial shuttle services that takes you to the same location @ approx 250-300 PHP per person.

From Caticlan sea port, Shangri-la staff will take you to their private ferry that takes you directly to the Shangri-la property on Boracay. This is available to you regardless which shuttle you take from Kalibo.

Once @ the property, check-in is so relaxing and easy. For us, this is one of the best moment of our trip. The reason is our original reservation was for a deluxe room with ocean view. Upon check in, Shangri-la staff introduced us couple of upgrade options. They took us on a tour of the upgrade options available and we instantly fell in love with the pool villa!! Shangri-la staff was very courteous, explained to us the additional cost, the services that comes with the upgrade to a pool villa. We did not feel @ any time that they were pushing us to upgrade. We truly feel their intention is for us to have a wonderful time @ their resort.

The pool villa is amazing!! I may want to write a review just for the pool villa option because there are so many good things to say about it. Shangri-la Boracay's web site can give you more details on the specifics of the pool villa. I will hit the key points that made my stay special:

1. We had our own butler.
2. Breakfast is included but instead of going to the buffet daily, we had the restaurant deliver our breakfast to our villa.
3. You can call the restaurant and have them deliver what ever is on the menu aside from the breakfast buffet.
4. Unlimited bottled water for consumption.
5. In-room refrigerator with some items free (sodas, juice), some items you need to pay (alcohol).
6. In-room safe.
7. HUGE walk in closet.
8. HUGE bathroom with separate shower and bath tub.
9. Two outdoor shower.
10. Large private pool. The pool is not heated. Boracay is never cold so this was not an issue for us.
11. Private entrance to our villa.
12. Complete privacy option when ever we want. No staff will bother you if you turn on this option while in the villa.
13. Outdoor cabana.
14. Large LCD TVs. The living room also has surround sound system.
15. Free in room fruit plate.
16. Free hi speed WiFi.
17. Separate temp control for living room, bed room, and bathroom.
18. Bedroom blinds/curtains control @ bedside. The ctrl buttons are like light switch for you to open or close the blinds/curtains.

Pool villa is pricey. But just like what my review title states, it's worth every penny!! If your budget allows, stay @ one of the villas.

Shangri-la has two private beaches to choose from. Beach chairs are plenty, though can run out during busy times. If you can't find an available beach chair, let the staff know, they will setup one for you.

The resort pool is amazing. Near the beach. Awesome view. Large size and very well designed. Though you may see lots of pool chairs occupied by guests, the pool never feels crowded.

Entertainment center has several free options: full size pool table, ping pong table, foosball, table hockey, computer terminals with high speed internet connection, Nintendo Wii, large selection of DVDs to choose from. Also has a full bar you can order drinks, food.

Never have to carry cash. Can charge everything to your room.

The whole property is extremely clean. From the lobby, guest rooms, pool, beaches, public areas, etc. Did not see any trash.

Free shuttle that takes you to White Beach area and back. Check with hotel staff for shuttle schedule. Shangri-la has staff member @ each of the destinated shuttle pickup location on the island.

Chi Spa is amazing. Love the services and private rooms for our massage session. They also have a pool for u to use while u wait for ur appt.

This is by far the best vacation we ever had. The best hotel/resort we have ever stayed in. We want to come back soon. You can't go wrong with Shangri-la Boracay.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"The hotel is simply perfect. My husband and I went there mostly for diving. The diving centre is excellent, equipment is great, instructors are very experienced and the operation is as smooth as it gets. The restaurants are memorable, the Italian one on top of the mountain and the one on the beach rocks are especially romantic. The staff will go out of their way to please you - I loved the crab cakes and they helped me to have it as an appetizer in almost every meal even though it was not on the menu.
The view from our room was great and we had a bed on our balcony so we could spend some time there watching the sunset which was quite nice.
The tennis courts were good too, the shuttles to the mall worked well and the hotel staff was overwhelming.
This is a truly honeymoon hotel, the private beach is really good too.",Food:Staff:Location
"An excellent place to stay if you want to unwind, relax and be pampered: from their exclusive Welcome Lounge at the jetty port and then the speedboat to ferry you to the island, spa services if you wish. The place is so serene and magical. simply paradise! The breakfast buffet had a wide variety of western and local food.

Before we left, i was already telling myself i will definitely be back! I would be happy spending my next Boracay vacation just inside the resort...

Highly recommended!",Food
"We spent three nights at the Shangri-la and loved it. The Journey to Boracay was taxing with flights from Hong Kong to Manila and transfer from the domestic airport to Caticlan. The journey took us over 11 hours due to delays in Manila and so we arrived late in the evening and were not able to take the speed boat direct to the hotel due to choppy sea conditions, however the staff from the airport and throughout the transfer process were great. Upon arrival at the hotel we had a small issue with our booking but we didn't let that get us down.
We stayed in one of the Loft Villas with a private pool and the duplex villa was wonderful, the spacious bedroom, fantastic bathroom and lovely sitting area/kitchen were great as was the outside pool area.
The main pool was also very good and quite large with a separate infinity pool overlooking the beach and ocean. The staff around the pool were all very helpful although service was at times a little slow but it didn't matter so much when lazing on the beach. We had our own butler, Joyce and whilst we didn't use the service as much as we could have, she was very good on the occasions that we did make a request of her.
We ventured into the town/shopping area where there is a public beach and the sand there was very fine and white whilst at the hotel it was quite coarse but again it did not make that much difference to us.
Breakfast at the hotel is great and generally with the food, portion sizes are huge and reasonably priced.
We were also fortunate to have a small intimate wedding ceremony on the beach which was organised by the hotel at short notice which was fantastic, a thanks to Suzenne and Mary for that.
Overall, we had a fabulous stay and if you can get over the slightly slow service at times, I would recommend the hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"My husband and I spent 5 nights in Boracay, 3 nights at a cheaper resort on the beachfront at station 1 and two nights at the Shangri-La. This was my second trip to Boracay.
Transfer to the Shangri-La was by mini van and was punctual and comfortable. The resort is on large grounds and is a rather sprawling affair. Movement around the resort is facilitated by golf cart which works pretty well.
Upon arrival we were greeted by what could have been a robot. Her lines were scripted and lacked any genuine warmth. To add insult to injury, she had not done her homework and failed to acknowledge that the booking was in my name, rather than my husband. Once it was pointed out that she was focusing on the wrong person, she became even more distant and aloof.
The check-in procedure was not the most professional, with the staff member failing to confirm a number of details, including our PHP5,000 credit for food and drink, loyalty programme, etc.
The room was deluxe with a king-size bed. It was spacious, clean and relaxed, with an outdoor verandah overlooking the gardens. Wi-fi was very good. (Housekeeping was a bit tight on the second day and failed to top up the tea, coffee, milk, etc.)
After checking in we headed down to the private beach and the swimming pool. The beach was small, with coarse sand and rough waves, but it was good to lie under the umbrellas. (Shagri-la also has a second shared beach which we found out the next day.) Food and service here was very good. We also spent some time lounging by and swimming in the pool which was also very good.
Dinner at the Serena Restaurant was disappointing. The restaurant was loud and didn't have much atmosphere. The food was ordinary, say 3-star standard, and overpriced. We had hoped that the PHP5,000 credit for food and drink would have gone further than one meal, but alas ...
(Side note: the fresh lobster and giant shrimp we enjoyed at D'Talipapa the next day was far better value.)
Both mornings we ate buffet breakfast at the Vintana Restaurant which was of good standard and offered extensive variety. However, it is better to go earlier (say 8.00am) rather than later (say 9.30am) as it gets very chaotic and the staff begin to spiral out of control.
The check-out process did not quite clear the low bar set by the girl at check-in. The staff member did not maintain eye contact with me, talked to other staff and made phone calls while checking me out. He expressed no care about our stay and there was certainly no fond farewell. I had to clarify with him that we were done.

Summary:
- the resort is probably best suited to honeymooners, families with kids, and introverts, agrophobics, etc.
- it is expensive and not necessarily the best value
- the customer service we experienced was not up to scratch, it fell a long way short from what we were expecting of this type of resort (we have stayed at similar resorts in Australia, Fiji, Guam, Hawaii and Japan)
- the restaurant dining experience let us down
- if you want to experience the Boracay lifestyle, this is not the place to be.

We were hoping for our stay at Shangri-La to be the cherry on our holiday cake, but to be honest we had a much better time at the hotel at station 1.",Food:Staff
"Between Friday's and Shangri La Resort & Spa, we finally chose to stay at Shangri La for our Boracay trip due to our previous excellent and unforgettable hospitality in other Shangri La location all over the world. But we have regretted that we should choose Fridays instead of Shangri La in Boracay.

The place is beautiful paradise and was worth us an effort to get there on the first day. But we have experienced a not so impressed of welcoming check-in process. It is thoughtful that they have prepared the room for us on out arrival and brought us to our room at once to go thru the check in process. I have booked a sew view family room for 2 but I was coming with 3 other friends who wants to take a look of our room. The check-up staff did not even ask us about the actual status of staying people but request every one to pass her a passport to register all information on the arrival form. Then she went thru pricing of getting 3 extra people staying in our room to us. Even we have explained that 3 friends were staying at Fridays, we have to go all the way back to the front office with her for her manager's advice. I took us almost an hour for this clarification. That was how we start our Boracay Shangri La Stay after a 12 hours of traveling from Manila.

The view there even is not on the white sand beach, but it is very beautiful and peaceful. We have almost forgotten the morning check-in incident. We reserved the Sirena, the resort's signature seafood restaurant. Shangri La Band hotels always care about their F&B services and always delivered excellent experiences but not in this Boracay one. Seafood dishes overall is below standard, the worse part which is the Seafood platter that came with not fresh Lobster, over cooked fishes, half cooked prawn... When we showed them the half cooked prawn, they exampled the prawn for awhile and tried to explain that was not a problem until we got request to meet the chef. She took away the half cooked prawn and brought us with the same prawn and the new cooked prawn. I did not understand the reason of bringing the disgusting half cooked prawn on the same plate with the new cooked one? Then the manager coming out with the chef, we gave them the overall comment of the signature seafood platter, but the manager's first reaction which was giving us 50% percent off on the seafood platter but no try to listening carefully our comment. We did not ask for discount but just want to comment on these dishes. Until he found out our disappointment of the overall dining experience in Sirena, he finally made us feeling that he seemed understanding what we mean. Then he offered us taking out that seafood dish from the bill. Actually, we don't care if the dish taking out from the bill or not, we just want the restaurant listening to us and do better in the future.

Then the Buffet breakfast part, I noticed the place was busy. but staff seems not attentive enough as simple as coffee order, we ordered hot coffee with warm milk. it turned out 2 mornings in a row that coming with cold milk and need our further reminding / correction.

After the first day and night experience, we spent the rest of second day at the D-mall and Fridays and only went back there for sleep. And no longer using any facility or F&B dinning in Shangri La Resort.

Even the housekeeping staffs are friendly, we believed that Shangri La Boracay will be taken off from my list in Boracay.",Staff:Food
"This place is beautifull, very peacefull, the kids play area is huge, slides and lots of toys, but only children aged 4 and up can be left without parent supervision.
we had clothing laundered, one of my partners shorts came back with 3 new buttons! now thats service that goes the extra mile!

Staff are so attentive, and remembered childrens names quickly, my son enjoyed being the king at the kids club preformance, pitty it was not advertised to people staying at the resort.

The bech area is great clear water and lots of fish, the area of Boracay is much cleaner than Bali, we were surprised tht there were not many Australians, visiting/i dont think they realise how beatifull this place is!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"As always from the moment you are greeted by the courteous knowledgable and more than accommodating staff , you enter shangrila , synonymous with paradise . IT IS! Your senses are immediately opened to an experience unforgettable . The beach area surrounded by mystical and myriad of infinity pools is breathtaking .. We had a villa on the beach that had a private pathway to the beach , private butler at our service , fresh huge fruit basket every morning, cookies and local tasty treats in the turndown evening service .. All fantastic extras .. Our 2 kids even had their own small size plush bathrobes and slippers ! They think of everything !
Costs a bit more , but worth every penny ! A truly memorable experience !",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Amazing! The Shangri-La’s Boracay Resort & Spa in the Philippines is set between expanses of Puka Shell Beach’s white sand and the beautiful and lush hillside. This is a luxury beach resort -not too small, and not outrageously big- with 219 rooms, suites and villas. Stay in the luxurious Seaview Suite. Gorgeous. Spacious balconies with sweeping views and the most splendid sunsets. This is the place to stay and relax. Get your body back to some form of balance—body and soul. If you want activities they have them-- like kayaking, parasailing and deep sea diving. Me, I just love to curl up with a dozen books and get some sun.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"This Shangri-la was perfect in every way. The grounds are beautifully landscaped, and the architecture of the buildings is inspired. The pools were especially nice, and the way they wind through the lush plantings gives them the air of a sinuous tropical river. Because of this clever layout there are lots of private places to lounge around the pool.

There are 2 beaches and both are very nice. They are nicer for swimming than white beach, since they have a little more depth to the water without going very far offshore. One has a soft powdery white sand bottom, and the other has some rocks and coral on the edges that harbor eels and fish.

We stayed in a 2 bedroom villa that is the nicest place I have ever seen in a hotel. It also had a beautiful private pool, infinity edged in black volcanic rock and granite, with blue slate tiles lining the interior. The bedrooms and living rooms were tastefully decorated with local Filipino furniture and artwork.

The staff who work there do an amazing job, and are unfailingly friendly. The food is great as well, and the seafood restaurant also has a beautiful ocean view. There is a nice bar on top of a huge limestone outcropping where you could watch the flying foxes head out in the evening. I don't think this place could be improved in any way.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This hotel is wonderful. It surpassed my (high) expectations. The service is above and beyond any other Shangri-La I have ever stayed. The grounds impecable. The rooms breathtaking and the views and pool/beach were glorious.
We traveled with a 4 year old and new born. Super child friendly in every aspect.
Food and Beverage is the only area that needs improvement. However, we were never dissapointed. Breakfast (included in the price) was insane- soo much delicious food to choose from.
Tip- for kids-bring a long sleeved shirt and socks to enjoy the wonderful playroom. Also, check out the daily activities for adults-wonderful excercise classes and personal training-
The staff from the lifeguards to the waiters to the GM are all on their toes, genuine, friendly and go the extra mile for the guests.
We had a spectacular vacation.
We stayed 5 nights-left once to check out the White Beach area, but could have never left the hotel and been fine. Expensive-but worth it.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Had an intense few weeks working in Manila and decided to shut down and head for the islands. Boracay was exactly what was needed, again a top notch setup from the Shangri-La chain. Beautiful room overlooking the sea, lovely beach, very secluded from the manic not-so-nice Boracay strip. If you need a weekend to relax go for it. Restaurants are ok and over priced, considering you are staying on a resort it could do better. Pool was very busy and we went off season, not ideal...for the price you pay I would expect less occupancy. Staff was friendly as always.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"travelled with 2 kids. stayed there in november 2011.

from the time you step out of the airport, you are well taken care of.
the hotel has a separate waiting area outside the airport, and a separate speed boat to take you to hotel. when you arrive at the hotel dock, the hotel manager is there waiting to greet the guests. finally, the concierge who accompanied us to the airport when we were about to leave managed to get us on an earlier flight so our waiting time was cut shorter.

the sand is not as nice as station 2, but beach is quiet. perfect if you are looking for a short nap and a lazy afternoon. there are two beach areas, we chose to stay on the longer more isolated side, however it is a five to 10 min walk to the pool area.

facilities for kids - the play zone was fun for the kids,with it's giant slide. remember to bring socks and wear long sleeved shirts.

breakfast - they had food that kids can choose from. room service was excellent.

shuttle service to D'mall is okay - despite what i read from the other reviews. there were always enough space on the shuttle and there was a staff at the end of D'mall with a signboard of hotel. you will pretty much know what time shuttle will be back.

"We recently returned from a four-night stay at the Shangri-La Boracay. However, before we booked the hotel I was looking at reviews and wanted to know the answer to one question: Is this hotel worth the price tag?

CONS:
- Food: The breakfast, although beautifully presented did not taste as good as it looked. They really cater to their Asian guests (understandably so as there were few western guests at the hotel) meaning that there is a lot of Korean, Japanese and Chinese dishes. The real issue however isn’t what they are serving but the quality of the food: there wasn’t anything I looked forward to trying again the next day. The ice-cream was stale (had that icy texture). The day we arrived the cream with the pancake had either been sitting out too long or had been expired. The final day we found a bug indented into our mango fruit slice. When I pointed out the bug the waiter he took the plate away with a quick apology, and I never heard back from anyone regarding the incident again.
- Service: It was just OK. When you’re paying 5 star prices you want to experience 5 star service. The first day upon lounging at the pool we found the service to be at its best because we had given a couple of tips here and there. However, as our tips were more random, the service started to decrease. There is a service to tip ratio, which is fine in places like America, but not something you want to deal with in Asia. By the last day I found myself having to walk to the bar to receive my bill where as other days it was delivered to me. More on this later.
- The rooms are nice, but we found mold along the bathroom shower. Simply unacceptable.
- Paying for amenities: We were very excited about the fact there was a tennis court, but we were shocked that we would have to pay 1,000 pesos for the privilege. As previous commenters have mentioned, snorkeling gear, and other activities all come with a cost. It would be so much more enjoyable if they were included in the price.
- Prices of cocktails: They are 3 times what they are in the center of town. Perhaps reasonable for westerners who are accustom to western prices, completely unreasonable to those of us who are accustom to Asian prices.
- Shuttle service into the main area: If you didn’t arrive 20 minutes ahead and put your name down on the list you could potentially not make the shuttle. Although the shuttle leaves every hour (during off-peak season) if you arrive on the hour you might have to wait until the next hour before another shuttle will arrive. This happened to us a couple of times, but thankfully the concierge called another van for us. The ride is about 18 minutes.
- A clear offering of what the hotel had to offer was never presented to us. Upon check-in we were told there was an outdoor BBQ 3 times a week. We were so excited about this, and had planned to attend. We were then informed that it wouldn’t be happening and that they would let us know if it were ever going to happen again. Well, we were never contacted again. However, we were really disappointed when we went out to the beach to have dinner and found a family enjoying a private outdoor BBQ. An alternative we would have loved to indulge in, but never was presented to us.
- Turndown service: bookmarks. We received a bookmark each of our nights. We enjoyed the Shangri La quotes, but not sure how useful 4 bookmarks are to someone who does most of their reading on an iPad.
- We experienced some unexplained noise in our rooms around 11:30 at night. The hotel did have it sorted promptly.
- They should offer one hot Jacuzzi for those of us who like to enjoy evening dips when it’s a little cool out.
- Rainy season potential guests: things really aren't up to speed at the hotel during this time. As mentioned things were closed down, even when it wasn't raining outside.

PROS
- As other guests have commented, the airport pickup on the speedboat is simply divine, especially if you’re lucky enough to have the boat to yourself.
- We booked a garden view room but received a sea view room, and it was definitely appreciated. If you’re going to be spending some time relaxing, the nice view really cemented that vacation feel.
- Free WIFI in the room. It was pretty speedy too, very convenient!
- Nice to have the privacy and private beach.
- The pools are beautiful and well maintained.
- The beach is nicely maintained.
- The lobby and other areas look better than they do in their pictures online.

The place didn’t have a positive feel—there felt like there was an underlying tension amongst the staff. Overall, the hotel didn’t leave me wanting to return (and I probably won’t). At present, I don’t think it is worth the price-tag, but the hotel has a lot of potential.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"Boracay is a beautiful beach destination and Shangri-la makes it perfect. From the moment your plane touches down in Caticlan, a Shangri-la representative will escort you all the way to the hotel. Lovely surprise was when we got in at 10:30am, Zandra the manager had someone escort us straight to our room and checked us in from there. We enjoyed the pool and both beaches. If you want a total beach experience, the Punta Bunga beach was quiet and had fine soft sand. If you want a little more action with people walking around and swimming by the pool, the other beach called Banyugan was pretty fun.
The breakfast at Vintana was exceptional with a wide selection of food except that they did not have any sugar free syrup for the pancakes, waffle and french toast otherwise, they had everything even to a breakfast buffet for kids. For lunch, we ate at the Cielo restaurant by the pool. Their spaghetti bolognese is superb. We had dinner at Sirena the first night, my husband had the vegetarian pasta with truffle oil and mushroom, I had baked lapu lapu. Ambiance was very romantic being on top of the hill ovelooking the Punta Bunga beach.
We also used the wet floor in the Health club...sauna, steam room and jacuzzi...great way to end the day and start the evening.
The next night, we had dinner in Rima. We had the Chef's antipasti and pizza. The chef surprised us with a ""chocolate surprise"" for our silver anniversary. Food was excellent and being high above among the tree villas, you will have an aerial view of the Shangri-la property. Awesome and beautiful. The last day on our way out, we had a quick lunch in the lobby lounge where I had their club sandwich...this portion is to share...very filling and yummy.
We were escorted through check in all the way to the private lounge of Shangrila in the Caticlan airport. If you want a vacation...must stay in Shangri-la Booracay. Service is excellent. So excellent that one of the waiters remembered us when we were there last year and addressed us by our family name. I was so impressed.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"If you want to just stay put in one place then there's no better place in Boracay than Shangri-la. The property is beautiful and the villas are gorgeous. We looked at a couple different ones and they were all lovely. Service was excellent and it was the most convenient trip to and from the airport I've experienced in Boracay. There are numerous dining and activity options within the resort and make sure to make an appointment at CHI Spa. It can get booked up especially if you want to experience one of their Signature Journeys: 3+ hours of pampered tranquility!!

But... if you want to experience the powdery white sand Boracay is known for (the beach itself in Shang is pretty but the sand isn't as great) and/or you want to be in the heart of things (bar hopping, restos, shopping) then you'll have to take the complimentary shuttle to the different Stations.

Still a great place to stay and worth the splurge!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"We stayed here for 6 nights on our honeymoon and this resort was one of the best i have stayed at anywhere in Asia. We snorkled out the front of the private beach, slept in the huge hammocks under the flapping palm trees, had treatments at the spa, ate at most of the restaurants, used the gym and steam rooms - all the facilities and in house activities were first class. The buggy system was great, just buzz the buggy and in a few moments they pull up and take you to anywhere in the resort quickly and its actually quite fun! The staff at the Cliff bar were beautiful and the restaurant staff were more than happy to get you anything and were so friendly! The room we stayed in was away from the main reception area and had a great view over the crystal clear blue ocean, sunset each night on our balcony with a few wines/ san miguels was a real treat!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"Being in Shangri-la Boracay felt like being in Gilligan's Island. We spent New Years there. The resort is beautifully decorated. There are villas on the hillside, by the pool and one on the beach. There are also rooms and suites in the hotel's main building. The best value for money are the rooms in the hotel.
Buffet breakfast is included and delicious. The pool restaurant is ok, but the service there is extremely slow.
The hotel has wifi. There are two beaches, one is private and only for hotel guests and another one is public but due to limited access for outsiders, also pretty private. Great place for a beach wedding.
The hotel has a big swimming pool, well equipped gym, tennis courts and great hills running or power walking. There's a buggy service to get around. The beach is nice, the sand is not as fine as the main beach is Boracay but it is pretty darn nice. In December the waves can be quite strong so my kids stayed in the pool. Kayaking is free of charge. Other activities such as jet skiing, snorkeling and scuba diving can be arranged at the activity center but you need to take a 20 minute boat ride to actually do the activities.
Chi Spa at the hotel is amazing. All massages are done in private villas and you come out floating.
To get to the main beach and the restaurants in town, they have a free shuttle service every 30 minutes or every hour depending on the time of day. It stops at D'Mall. They also offer a paid shuttle service to other locations on the island. This was the only draw back. For the price and status and location of the hotel, they should offer a free pick up and drop off to any location in the island.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"We arrived in Boracay on August 20th, 2011. From the moment we stepped out of the airplane we felt the warm welcome from the Shangri la staff. As soon as you arrive to the resort itself you tend to have a different feeling of entering another world. The most important of all is you never feel lost of what to do, since there is always someone there to guide and inform you.
We where directly taken with a buggy cart to our loft villa escorted by Junni who was so helpful from the moment we arrived and until our departure.
The loft villa was amazing!! The furniture, the amenities and so many details made it so special. They even remembered to prepare cookies with smiley faces as well as candies for the kids. The sea view was breathtaking.
If it wasn't for my kids I wouldn't have left the villa. I could have sat there for days without going out.
Our villa was a bit far from everything; however it was suitable for us. Rima was the only restaurant that was a few minutes walk from the villa.
Our kids had a great time at the amusement center and the kid's adventure zone. The staff there are so nice and caring.
The food tastes great especially at sirena restaurant.
In fact all staff were polite and helpful from the security to the buggy cart drivers. They greet you whenever you see them even while you are riding the buggy cart. It is an amazing facility with superb staff. Keep it up guys!! You are the best!!
I just have a special thanks to our villa butler jonelle who was outstanding. He was with us and on call almost at anytime and ready to help. He is the best!!
Roger also was of great help from the time we arrived and until we departed.

Many thanks,

"Just back from a woderful relaxing holiday to Boracay. We stayed at Shangri-la Resort and I would say it is a complete resort in itself, there is full entertainment for all ages.The rooms are spacious and the view from the room is marvelous. The breakfast is huge with so much variety.
Being a Shangri-la guest You start feeling stand apart from others right from stepping out of your flight untill getting back into the flight. The shuttle Bus service was very prompt and timely. All the restaurants in the resort served delicious different cuisine. The most highlighted feature of our stay was the service from the hotel staff of all levels, they were so courteous and helpfull and ready to do anything for making your stay as comfortable as possible. My special thanks to Ms. Junne of the Guest services Desk who handled our check-in and also our check -out and making it so hassel free.

"This one tops all my hotel stays. or should I say this is a resort.

I went here with family ( 2 small kids aged 3 and 5) for a 3N/4D vacation and this was really a memorable and fantastic hotel/resort.

I enjoyed this stay and my kids love it too.

From the airport, Shangrila staff picks you up. I guess this has been reviewed here already.

We got an ocean view room ( maybe next time a villa with a pool eh but the cost is very expensive). Breakfast is good. Room is nice. They have their own resort with kids pool and a huge pool for everyone. it has been described here already, if you are planning to stay in Boracay and you have the budget, go for this hotel it is worth it.

This is a resrt on itself and you dont ahve to go somewhere else but still they provide shuttle going to other beaches. Also they have golf carts if you wanted to go to other places of the resort when you dont feel like walking but I would rather see the entire resort on foot and we did and it is really a nice place.

I will give this hotel a 5 star rating.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

"We really find it difficult to put in words our 4 day holiday at Shangri La. Every little detail was taken care of to perfection. The resort is located in a gorgeous setting. Magnificent views of the clear blue ocean greeted us whilst driving down the winding road leading to the resort. The check in was simple and easy and we were in our room in 10 mins. We had specifically asked for a resort tour and a lovely front office executive took us around the entire property. The tree houses got our vote for the best room in the property. The living room on the top floor with your own private Jacuzzi and stunning view of the ocean was a dream in itself. Then there was the equally impressive bedroom on the 2nd floor.

The service at this resort was the best we’ve ever experienced. Even the drivers and the bell boys were so courteous, professional and willing to help with whatever we wanted. On the day of our departure, we had a small entourage escort us to the boat jetty (about 20 mins away) to see us off. Their HR Manager came with us in the speed boat all the way to caticlan port to ensure that we had no problems during departure. Truly a special special feeling.

The facilities at Shangri La – well they do not believe in half measures! . Their gym compares to some of the best I have been to. They have a huge day care centre if you want to have someone take care of your little one for a while. Their Spa is a resort in itself, each treatment room is a small cottage with a tub, bedroom, etc.. and there are 12 such cottages. Two beaches (one private and one semi private) are truly enjoyable and we were there every evening.

A free shuttle takes you to D’mall every hour and there is a return trip too, so that is a huge convenience. Once we got late and were waiting to take the 1:15 am shuttle back from D’mall to the resort. Whilst waiting, there were a lot of seedy characters hanging around us and it got a little intimidating. Shangri La ensures that their bell boy and a solidly built security guard stands watch over their guests at the pickup point. To find them there was one of the most comforting sights during our entire trip J

All in all, every aspect of Shangri La Boracay reeks of class and finesse and I would definitely try other hotels in this chain in the future.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"I loved this resort so much. I loved the location, I loved the pools and beach, and most of all I loved our Loft Villa and plunge pool. The Loft Villa was nothing short of amazing and we were fortunate to stay there for 4 nights. The design was incredible and the the patio area was such a wonderful place to relax or have a meal. The furnishings were ethnic, comfortable, and well maintained, except maybe for the sisal rugs. I had no idea how much I would love the patio, pool, and outdoor shower. The shower had 2 wooden windows that you could open up to take in the views. Plus it had hot and cold water. The porch next to the plunge pool, just beyond the pergola with dining area, had 2 very comfortable lounge chairs and large umbrella. Rocks lined the side of the infinity pool and as water trickled over the edge and down the side, made for a lovely water feature when you sat there. Such a nice detail. Our bed was very comfortable and the view from the upstairs bedroom was equally stunning, especially when the sliding doors were retracted. We also loved the lanai off the masterbedroom that overlooked the pool. The Villa had a small galley kitchen area with an undercounter refrigerator stocked with complimentary (soda, beer, juices, milk) and non complimentary drinks (Perrier, Evian). Unfortunately the refrigerator was never really cold enough. I asked the butler to take a look at it and they came immediately to try to fix the problem, but never really did but I just didn't want to make a fuss. Any other item that was not in working order, they immediately replaced (clock, ipod dock). There was also a Nespresso cappuccino machine which took some getting used to before we could make our coffee in the morning. 2 butlers and a Youtube video (from the free wireless internet) and we finally were able to figure it out. What a treat to have cuppucino and fresh mangoes outside on the veranda first thing in the morning! I loved how environmentally conscious the resort was. They had glass bottles of purified water (still and sparkling) that were produced at the resort and placed throughout the villa. There were used instead of .5L plastic disposable water bottles. They were dated with the time of production as well so you knew how old the water was.

We were a family of 4 (2 children ages 12 and 16) so they set up a twin bed downstairs and opened up the sleep sofa. The sleep sofa was adequate for my 85 lb daughter but would probably not suffice if you were an adult. At our request, they left the sleep sofa open as a bed, but there was another loveseat in the living room if you wanted to sit down. We never wanted to sit indoors when we had the incredible space outside. The Wi-fi signal, though weak, was still available outside in all areas of the patio. The room was very clean and our butler did an excellent job keeping it neat and stocked though he couldn't quite remember to stock Diet vs. regular Coke.

The pools were so extensive and gorgeous. We spent hours swimming between pools and finding all the little alcoves that had lounger and jets built in them. The beach adjacent to pools was very clean with fish swimming in the water. It was clear and blue with nice waves and no undertow. There were lifegaurds everywhere and they were always vigilent. Sometimes it was a little hard to get the attention of someone from the bar to get drink orders but when Laud from the beach bar was working, he always remembered us made himself available. You walk through a small arch just behind the pools to reach the other semi-private beach with the water sports. We went to Boracay in late June and the resort was only at 50% capacity so no one was really at this beach though they still had a lifegaurd present. Sadly there was quite a bit of trash that had washed up on this beach. The previous days, they had workmen cleaning up the beach and raking seaweed and trash up but they just couldn't keep up with the tides. This was such a shame to see. Fortunately, the trash wasn't visible from balconies as this was the beach that our villa overlooked.

We felt very safe on the resort. There were security gaurds everywhere. We almost always walked the stairs to our villa from the main building and we would pass no less than 3 or 4 gaurds. Everyone was so pleasant and friendly and would always greet you. The staff at the Shang are just so lovely, they are wonderful to be around, are very eager to fill your request, and very willing to help. They are what make this resort such wonderful place to visit.

We had breakfast every morning at the buffet in Ventana and it was sensational. We ate so much and there was a nice variety each day. The fruit was amazing and the juice bar was incredible. There were so many choices. They had the freshest tasting orange and mango juice that I have ever had. I had a slice of pizza, ube ice cream, noodle soup, and Filipino specialties every morning. The food was so good and we ate so much that we only had to eat dinner later in the day. We had dinner at the seafood restaurant which was good but very pricey, dinner at Ventana once which we really enjoyed, and dinner brought to our villa which was very good and set up on the table so beautifully. Outside from the breakfast, I would rate the food at the resort as good to very good. One note: both my husband and son ordered the ceasar's salad one evening and had no untoward effects (being that we are from the states and they warn tourists not to eat raw vegetables).

Going during low season, really had its advantages. It was so uncrowded so it was even more relaxing. We rarely had neighbors on either side of our villa. The pool area was peaceful and it wasn't difficult to find available lounge chairs. Restaurants were near empty and very quiet. We were able to book a family spa treatment at Chi where all 4 of us could fit and have a massage at the same time. They had an early bird discount where it was 20% less if you had your service done before 11 am so we gave it a try. The facility was so beautiful and quiet, and empty! We had a private family bugalow with dressing area,bathroom, steam room, shower, pool, patio, and outdoor tub. My daughter and I had a massage and facial for 2 hours and my husband and son had a 2 hour massage. It was such a nice treat. .

Before leaving for Boracay, I read so much about the resort on Tripadvisor so I would know what to expect. One little disappointment, though no fault of the Shang, was that we were not able to arrive or leave directly from the private boat jetty on the resort. With safety being a priority, and the winds and seas not cooperating, we had to take the resort speedboat from the pier near the airport to a pier at The Fairways Golf Resort, then take another van from that resort to the Shangri-La. Their staff at the airport were so very incrediible. When we departed the resort and arrived at the lounge at the pier, they informed us that our flight from Caticlan on PhilAir Express had been cancelled and that the airline would provide tranportation from Caticlan airport to Kalibo airport almost 2 hours away. John Allan from the Shangri-La was so helpful at the airport speaking with airline reps, finding costs for alternative flights on different airlines so that we could get back to Manila in time, and he stayed with us until we could decide what to do. We left the facilities and caring hands of the resort, decided to fly out of Kalibo with PhilAir Express, sat in their dingy lounge (we couldn't help but giggle at the difference), then went on our way. How surprised we were as our van approached Kalibo airport, to see Shangri-La staff descend upon us to assist us with our bags and make sure we arrived at the correct gate. We thought we had left everyone at the Shang behind in Caticlan. Amazing! We will definitely be back when we travel to the Philippines.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This resort is simply perfection. . There is no other way to describe.
I always thought that the service at resorts in Asia was excellent, but this place takes service to another level.
From the moment we arrived at the airport to the moment we checked out it was one good surprise after another.

ARRIVING/ LOCATION - outstanding. We arrived at the Caticlan Airport and were taken to Shangri-la's lounge while we waited for our transfer. The boat takes you directly to the resort and contrary to other resorts you don't need to take a boat, then a car/taxi to get to your destination. From the moment you meet them at the airport you don't have to worry about your luggage or anything else. They take care of everything and are always one step ahead.
The resort has 2 beaches ( one private and one semi- private). The water is crystal clear and fish swim around you!

SERVICE- This was by far what surprised me most. Everybody is very friendly so willing to make your holiday memorable. There is no fake smile, they were so genuine!

One morning during breakfast my friend wrote a comment in the comment card that she couldn't find the cheese bread which she had tried in the previous morning. In that same day around 12 noon when we were lounging on the beach one of the managers ( I wish I could remember his name) stop by and apologize because they didn't have the bread that morning. He then gave her a bag with freshly baked cheese bread just baked for her! That is what I call AMAZING SERVICE.
I don't even know how he knew we were at the beach and who we were... and to bring warm freshly baked bread it was unbelievable. That was not all, the following mornings as soon as we sat down to have breakfast the waiter would bring the warm bread to our table.
Keeping in mind that this is a big resort, I couldn't believe how personalized the service was.

One night we went to the Italian restaurant ( which I highly recommend) and we were not in the mood for dessert. However they brought us some dessert samples . "" The chef said he doesn't want you to go home without dessert "" the waiter told us . WOW!
Next day we went to their seafood restaurant and the food took a little longer than usual to come. We didn't complain because we were having wine and talking, and to be honest we didn't even noticed but they brought each of us a dessert to apologize for the waiting .

ROOMS- Very clean, and have all the amenities you expect. I love the fact that everyday they refill 2 liters of water and don't charge extra for that. There were also fresh fruits. And the toiletries were L'Occitane. The BEST part was the ""free"" wireless internet throughout the resort
We all know that nothing is actually ""free"" but it is great when they don't overcharge you as many hotels do...

BREAKFAST - Amazing buffet. They have everything you can possibly want. And in case they don't, you just have to ask. I found very creative that they had a mini breakfast buffet for kids with a low table so small children can reach, mini cup cakes and children favorite foods ...

SPA - the Chi Spa was spectacular. The spa consists of many individual villas so you don't have to share the changing room, sauna,etc. You have a villa just for you with your very own changing room, jacuzzi, sauna, shower etc. Extremely private, which I really really appreciated!
I had a 2 hour massage and it was very good.

RESTAURANTS -we went to the seafood and Italian, both were great but the Italian was simply perfect. The chef is from ( surprise!) Italy, and the food is to die for. I had the trio fish carpaccio and prawn risotto.

GYM- The gym surprised me (again!). It is very spacious and all the equipment were updated/ knew.

KIDS CLUB/ACTIVITIES : I noticed that they had a kids club or indoor playground, it is a great place for kids. And they also had activities for adults.

Overall It was one of the best holidays of my life. This is a great place for couples, families with children and friends.

"Stayed here for two nights in mid-June. Despite the off-season (resulting in strong winds and waves), the resort is a great place to stay in! The only difference during off season is that the speed boat from the airport has to land at the other side of the island, instead of right at the resort.

True, the sand in the beach may not be as ""powdery smooth"" as those in the main beach, but if you prefer not being bothered by different people hawking wares, this is the place to stay in Boracay. The beach is private and still amazingly beautiful! Staff would come and offer shots of mango juice as a relief to the sun.

The service is outstanding - from arrival at Caticlan airport at baggage claim, up to the assistance at check-in for your outgoing flight. Consistent good service throughout with a smile!

The rooms are well laid out and comes with all the amenities and comfort that you would need. They provide a buggy (golfcart) service to the rooms, although they are walkable. The food served in the breakfast buffet is very good (so good that they need to be refilled constantly) as with the food by the swimming pool.The Chi Spa also provided impeccable treatments.

I would definitely be back.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We had high expectations in visiting this resort and they were all met and in many cases exceeded on arriving. The resort is large but spotless, everything is in pristine condition. Everything in our 8 nights was pretty much faultless, arrival was quick and efficient from being met in the airport, the transfer by minivan and then boat and checkin in our villa. We were checked in and in our room some 40mins from getting off the plane in Caticlan.

Travelling with 2 young children a key consideration for us is always the facilities for the kids and they too were excellent, even though the adventure zone was relatively quiet with kids our 8 and 5 year old couldn't wait to get there in the morning and never wanted to leave in the afternoon, so much so they hardly used the superb pools or beaches. The girls at the adventure zone were great with the kids and were always happy to see them in the morning and play with them when other kids weren't about.

We stayed in a villa and as soon as we arrived (early) the villa was available and immaculate, special mention to Alex our butler throughout the stay who couldn't do enough for us be it arranging BBQ's in the villa garden to organising visits to craft centres, bringing things to the beach that we'd forgotten or any other request no matter how small or big it was was sorted quickly and with a smile.

Food in the restaurants was good, a good selection at the breakfast buffet in the mornings although perhaps a little limited for lunch (although this may have been the fact it was low season). My only real complaint on the first morning was my coffee was only warm, from the next day's breakfast as soon as we arrived in the restaurant we served fresh hot coffeee and checked regularly to ensure the coffee was fine and met our expectations. Also it would have been good to have a little notice of planned events, a garden BBQ with live band was arranged on our last Saturday on the same day we arranged for one in our villa.

The thing that really makes the Shangri-la in Boracay is their staff, so many friendly faces and all wanting to help you in whatever way they can. From our 2nd day there most of the staff seemed to know our whole family by name, our room number and what we liked for drinks etc when we sat down at the bar or for a meal. They truely are exceptional and what makes the difference at this resort.!!!

When our last day arrived none of us wanted to leave and can't wait to return for our next holiday, so much so it is already booked!!",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I like this place, even if it is a bit pricey. When you are elderly and travel solo, the staff looks after you. They ring you in the morning, try to anticipate your needs. They listen to you when you say something. They make you feel at home. You have privacy, but they are unobstrusively around. They arrange whatever activity you want to do for the day. I do not like any other place in Boracay, except the Shangrila. I feel safe and secure here.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"For our first wedding anniversary, we stayed at Shangrila Boracay. We've been to Boracay many times and we've stayed at the other resorts there but after staying at Shangrila, we cannot stay anywhere else anymore!!! It's excellent in facilities, service, rooms, and people!:) Everywhere you go, the staff greet you with a smile. They also go out of their way for your simple requests! We hung out and ate near the pool and beach and there's this waiter named ""Laurito"" who was very very accomodating. He gave us water, towels, took our pictures and even gave us free smoothies! He was just really really nice to us!:) Everyone in Shangrila Boracay is awesome!:) We can't wait to go back!:) Thank you Boracay Shangrila for an awesome experience!:)",Staff:Food:Location
"This will definitely my first choice when I go to Boracay next time. They provided high quality services and facilities. The private beaches and pools are perfect to stay for relaxing. And, it is indeed worthy to take few hours in Chi, the Spa to get a wonderful Massage. We stayed in Shangri-La's Boracay two days and it is most memorable for us in this trip.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
