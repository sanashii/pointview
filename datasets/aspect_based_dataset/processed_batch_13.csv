"This was a well-maintained hotel in the city centre. Some floors were also newly refurbished recently. The room was comfortable and I had a huge King-sized bed that was actually 2 Queen beds put together. Buffet breakfast was also pretty impressive with a large selection of Asian and Western food.

The only complaint I had was they extremely slow check-in process which took about 30 minutes. The only redemption was the welcome drink made up of a fruit and vegetable smoothie that was interesting and tasty.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"It was my husband's birthday and Citibank gave us FREE room if we book for just one night at their Tower Wing Premier Room. We were given a corner room on the 13th floor and we immediately felt so special. The room smelled fresh and clean. Pillows and bed were soft and clean. Toilet was big and the toiletries smelled good. A few minutes after we checked-in a birthday cake was delivered to our room.

We are a a family of 4 adults and we availed of 2 rooms. We were impressed by the service of their staff in the gym. Aside from giving us a brief tour of the gym facilities, she even made a demo of how we can benefit from a new machine. She also accompanied us to the Chi Spa and from there she accompanied us to the elevator leading to our room. This girl's name is Mitch. We will never forget her.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"My second time staying at edsa was just as luxurious as the first. The hotel has all the ammenities one would need and they wil accommodate you with any wish. However i did have some issues with the organisation of the staff in the restaurant. We had a prearranged deal with included meals, but somehow i ended up being charged extra, and asked about this seeveral times during my stay. Furthermore one of the hostess' was quite snobby and gave me a really bad impression. The rest of the staff are nothing short off amazing. Especially the room cleaning crew and the pool crew. Big cudos for them. All in all a great place for a longer stay, all though some of the restaurant staff should be better organized.",Staff:Food
"I often take my dog (22-lbs, very well trained, wonderful soul), especially when I travel with family or business more than a week. It's very unfortunate that I could not take him on this trip because we were staying here. This is a beautiful hotel, don't get me wrong. I do not mind paying a pet fee or something, I just wish they would have options for pet owners who travel for business or leisure.",Staff
"I really wanted to be blown away by the level of service and luxury at this hotel. It is after all a Shang and therefore should be amazing. Sadly there's not a lot of good points. I stayed at the hotel for 35 nights so enough time to be wowed. Firstly the good points
Airport pick was quick and easy and the car had cold water, snacks and decent WiFi
Check in was efficient and I was taken straight to my room (more on that later)
Room is clean and tidy
Location is good within 200m of Mega Mall, easy walk to Podium and attached to the Shangri la Plaza
Hotel cars are always on time
The staff smile and offer a warm greeting you every time you return to the hotel (also helpful provided you don't ask for anything)

As I say for a short couple of days everything seems fine. Now for the not so good points

The first room I was put into was next to the lift shaft, there is only so many times you can hear six different lifts go bing every time they stop
Second room had a light in the entrance that wouldn't turn off even after reporting to the staff 3 times
Breakfast was not included in the room rate, despite the advertised long stay rate on their own electronic board saying it was.
Breakfast is 1540 pesos in Heat so I declined (but was told my special deal had 20% discount)
A simple gin and tonic was more expensive than their cocktails.
Not one staff member could explain why the long stay special on their electronic board was cheaper and had more inclusions than my special long term rate
WiFi very average and drops out numerous times
Getting a final bill to check out took 3 visits to the desk
Had to still pay more as they had forgotten items after final check out
If you do have a problem most of the staff will attempt to avoid you

Due to the location of my office this is one of the choices, however there are many better 5 star choices. At around 260usd per night I expect more",Staff:Value for money:Food
Nice Facilities. Close to everywhere worthwhile. 'Avoided the Metro traffic by setting up the meetings around the Ortigas area. Buffet at Heat restaurant is very good.

"For the Past 7 years I have made Edsa Shangri-La my second home in Manila. I come every year to Manila and always make sure I stay a few nights here. The moment you walk in you feel immediately welcome and the beautiful lobby and furnishings ensure you are staying in pure luxury. However, the hotel has been recently renovated and the rooms are now a lot less glamorous. The room I stayed in recently was poorly finished (paint was on the tiles of the bathroom, sockets on the desk not secured etc). The colours and design of the room now a lot lighter compared to the dark furnishings before- you feel like you are in a mermaid theme room with turquoise curtains and vibrant colours all around compared to the golden yellows and dark wood furnishings before. Overall I’m a bit disappointed, but still the hotel hosts quality amenities that make it a comfortable stay. For one, the Pool and its gardens are a perfect way to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Nice size gym with everything you need from punching bag to weights, Sauna, Steam Room, Jacuzzi, Tennis Court/Basketball court- it has it all. The highlight of the Hotel for me and main reason I come back year after year is the Buffet Breakfast at Heat. Countless amount of choices and variety from American Breakfast to Filipino to Indian, Fresh Native Fruit, European Cold cut meats, Dim sum, Ramen, Fresh French Bread and Pastries, Freshly squeezed Juice- Anything thing your belly desires is here and it is such a treat- (tip:- start around 8am as less busy)- A special recommendation to Chef Rico Mendoza who is on the Omelette station and has made me feel so special over the past 7 years of staying at Edsa Shang. Once your done with Breakfast you are a short stroll from Shangri-la plaza Mall or Mega Mall or if you are looking for a bargain only a short taxi ride from GreenHills. Hotel is extremely safe (security and sniffer dogs outside, taxis plates are recorded if you pick one up at the hotel entrance). This hotel caters for the business traveller also in its Horizon lounge which is away from the noisiness of Family Guests and Balikbayan reunions. Hotel lobby has nice evening entertainment where you can enjoy a few drinks and snacks whilst listening to a live singers and piano player under candlelight. I’m not a big fan of the hotel restaurants as they are extremely overpriced and you can find better food quality food outside (Senju resto gave me food poisoning one year- Hotel still charged me for a Doctor). I have stayed at this Hotel over various months of the year, and as each year goes by it just seems to get busier, but the hotel still maintains a high standard of service and you still maintain the 5 star luxuries that you are paying for. This hotel far surpasses the likes of the Peninsula, Dusit, Pan-Pacific etc as if you are a foreign visitor you have a better taste and experience of the Filipino culture and hospitality in a 5 star environment.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"This is a beautiful hotel in Manila with a wonderful pool and an over-road link to the mall. The rooms are spacious and clean and the food is of a generally high standard if you can get it......

The service completely lets down this supposed five star hotel with incompetent but friendly staff. A simple order of fries took the best part of an hour to arrive by the pool and when they did, they were the wrong order; an offer of coffee at breakfast only arrived after 15 minutes and being chased twice; cars ordered at least half a day in advance were suddenly unavailable at the correct time; a request to have my room cleaned at 5pm each day during my stay (offered on check in so not a demand from me) was somehow forgotten every day even though each day I was assured a note went on the account.

"My husband had been avoiding this hotel due to the horrendous traffic going to this place as we love down south. However, the lure of the resort like pool, caught our attention.
What was horrific was the partially clogged drainage in our shower room. Good thing they have prompt service although this made us delayed in our tight schedule.

"What a welcome treat to be able to stay four nights in a row. After each day's work, it was just great to drop your back to a soft yet sturdy bed with fluffy pillows around you. Although our room had no bath tub, it was made up for by a strong shower that felt like a massage. Each shower was a very relaxing experience. The Samsung Smart TV gave such quality HD images that viewing the movies and news from my bedside was a delight. One morning I walked around the gardens by the poolside. It was so quiet I could hardly believe I was actually right in the midst of a frenzied metropolis. The location is superb as there is a plethora of excellent restaurants within the hotel complex and as soon as you'd step out of the hotel vicinity. The MRT station is also within walking distance that it makes it so easy for one to move from point to another within Metro Manila.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We booked 4 nights at the shangri la edsa hotel during our short visit to the Philippines this month. This was my second time to stay in this hotel. The first was more than 5 years ago. It seems like the rooms were just updated. The standard rooms are small, but the property is very well maintained and keeps up with the five star feel. We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. I am all praises to the staff who were very helpful and courteous all the time. We enjoyed several laps in the pool as it was not crowded when we were there. For tourists, the location of the hotel is very convenient as it it walking distance to both shangri la mall and sm megamall so finding a good restaurant or shopping is not a problem. Of course, the hotel is expensive, and with the price that we paid, it did not even come with breakfast. But I think its worth it. The price is still relatively cheaper compared to other shangri la hotels in the country and you get the same excellent service. We consider shangri la edsa hotel one of our favorite hotels in metro manila. Thank you for making our stay memorable. We will be back.",Value for money:Location:Food

"Stayed here with The Wife while attending a conference (13th-16th March 2015). Huge, slightly dated and borderline ostentatious lobby, which can get very full during the weekends. Staff generally polite and helpful. Our check-in was prompt and efficient, although some friends checking-in the day after us (Saturday) experienced delays of a few hours.
Drinks in the lobby lounge can be frightfully expensive, so choose wisely.
Our room was a wee bit small but certainly adequate for the 2 of us. The bathroom was noticeably smaller with no bathtub.
We stayed on the 6th floor (Tower Wing, pool view) but had no issues with any unwelcome noise. The room, while comfortable, wasn't special and lacked some of the amenities and frills found in other Shangri-La hotels, but nothing really to complain about.
We dined the next morning in the Heat restaurant, part of the buffet breakfast package included with our room. We were quite pleased with the service, staff were numerous, polite and helpful.
Food was fairly good with somewhat limited meat and fish options, it all seems to be different varieties of pork. On 2 mornings, the chicken had run out when we got there.
We checked out early, on a Monday morning, so that bit was smooth and quick. We were told that traffic to the airport can be horrendous in the mornings. It wasn't, we reached the airport (T1 NAIA) early and discovered that waiting in the departure area was more horrendous than any Manila traffic jam.
The hotel seems to be a favorite with the locals, it's a venue for weddings and other events. As mentioned earlier, the lobby area can get pretty crowded.
The hotel is next to the Shangri La Plaza, a stylish mall with many high end stores.
It also has good dining options, with a supermarket and money changer in the basement.
Right in front of the hotel is the SM Megamall (there are several SM Malls, this one is popularly known as the Megamall), an apt name indeed.
Tip: This was our first trip to the Philippines, and so we decided on a half-day city tour. We asked several tour operators, and they were charging Peso 2,000 per head, departing from the hotel, for a 4 hour round trip. The tours leave at 8am and 1pm. Unfortunately, both timings were awkward for us.
We instead booked a hotel limo which was ready to go in 15mins, and paid P2300++ for a 3 hour trip. The car was comfortable, our driver Arnold was a lovely chap, and a wonderful tour guide as well. He would stop and wait patiently while we stepped into churches (gorgeous) and parks. We visited the old Spanish quarter, Jose Rizal park and the Bay Area, before stopping for lunch in Makati. It was a very comfortable way to see the city and might be a better option than a formal tour (that would have taken us to the same areas mentioned above).
Back to the EDSA Shangri-La. Good. Maybe even very good. But not one of the greats.
A place to stay if you intend to shop at the nearby malls. Might be good for families too, the pool was very popular with children. Plus the malls are kid friendly.
We would return.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"This was our third stay at this hotel and our fourth at a Shangri-La. The great service and amenities that brought us back seemed even better than before. Unfortunately for me an old leg injury decided to act up to the point that it impaired my mobility and kept me in a wheel chair for most of our stay. This required the hotel staff to provided additional service and assistance in getting around the hotel. This additional service was not only provided, it was cheerfully exceptional showing genuine concern and care for our well being. The pretty hotel doctor who tended to my needs prescribed that I go easy and get plenty of rest. We couldn't have been in a better place to do this. I spent most of our stay down by the pool enjoying its garden like setting. The pool attendants were always helpful and very friendly. Same goes for the staff at the Heat Restaurant, The Business Center, front desk, the room attendants and the crew of the Concierge, along with great room service all contributed to one of our best hotel experiences.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"I had a pre-paid confirmed booking for this hotel via KAYAK. I called the hotel one day before the check-in date to arrange for airport transfer. They tell me that they cannot find my reservation. After I email them my confirmation and several follow up calls, I get an email at 10:24 pm from the hotel (the night before I am due to check in) saying ""We did find the booking order sent to us by the travel agency, however, we regret to inform you that we are unable to process the request as we are booked to capacity for the period requested."" and asking me to change my dates! This is for a CONFIRMED PREPAID booking. I call the hotel immediately but I am told that reservation is now closed and to call back tomorrow. I try explaining that I just received the email so how can the person not be available and I am flying in tomorrow so I need to sort this out, but they just tell me to call back tomorrow. I called KAYAK who had no explanation as to what happened but they agreed to refund my money under the circumstances. It is worth mentioning that same night the hotel showed availability on booking.com for 100$ per night more than what I had booked for. So do yourself a favor and do not book this hotel unless you don't mind being stranded last minute. They apparently have no problem not honoring your reservation if they can get more money for it.",Staff

"Being a frequent traveler to the Philippines, I'm been to many of the upscale hotels in the Metro Manila area. EDSA Shangri-La was a big disappointment for me. I stayed there over a month, and never felt like a valued guest. When you stay at Sofitel or Fairmont, for example, there's a level of customer service that you get that Shangri-La doesn't begin to come close to. Additionally, they shortchanged me on the rewards points for my stay and won't do anything about it, even after multiple contacts.

The hotel itself is nice, and the location is good if you need to be near Ortigas or Mandaluyong. If you are like me and enjoy quality customer service (particularly with the price you pay at hotels like this), you may want to look at other options.",Value for money

The hotel is in a good location with the biggest shopping mall I have ever seen across the street.

The only problem was the front desk. My stay was to be billed to our corporate card. The Front Desk was not aware of this and insisted I produce my personal card with the assurance that it would be worked out the next day. I was assured it was corrected the next day. On checkout, however, the Front Desk again was not aware and billed my card (I was there for 2 weeks so this pretty much tapped me out). After many emails back and forth I finally was sent a notice that my account would be credited in a few days. That was on 2/16. It still has not been credited even though the bill was debited to the corporate card. It's been two months now and I don't think I will ever see my money again.

"Just wanted to share to all Tripadvisor readers another excellent trip/experience I had on my recent stay at Shangri-la hotel, Edsa Philippines.
Aside from the main purpose of citing the people and staff who had demonstrated superb service, I also do hope that people who read this might also benefit and be able to compare their experiences with other hotels.

Same as with my previous stays , check-in and check-out was a breeze. Despite the busy reception area, the staff were able to balance and properly manage accommodating the guests so as to minimize waiting time. And even with my previous stay, which was 14 months ago, I was greeted and treated as if they know me really well, and as if I was just there yesterday. Really a surprise. And this was not only at the reception area, but also by some staff at the concierge and breakfast area.

I was escorted to my room and was likewise briefed on the features and operations, of which, I did not expect of learning something new, particularly the video/audio interface connections of the work desk to the TV and bathroom speakers. This was indeed helpful as I do regularly project my laptop to the TV , as well as sometimes play my music while relaxing on the tub.

Quality and variety of breakfast have always been far superior than others. Even with my 3 weeks stay there, I had not grown tired or ran out
dish selection.

One highlight which I won’t forget, was that my birthday ( which was not a big deal for me at this age  ) happen to fall during my stay there.
There was a small birthday cake placed in my room the night before my birthday. And I thought that was it, but I was wrong.
On the day of my birthday, when I came down to grab some breakfast, I was greeted by the host with a “happy birthday, sir!”, which I was indeed surprised and impressed on how Shangri-la manage this.
Later in the day, my door bell rang, and when I opened it, four pretty Guest Relations damsels sang a customized happy birthday song to me.
I have posted a photo, but pardon the “smiley” as Im a shy person.
This is one birthday that I will not forget.
I learned later, while talking with Ms. Joy, Guest Relations Manager, that these activities were initiated and orchestrated by Ms. Vianny, their Guest Relations
Supervisor. I also learned that it was Ms. Vianny who arranged my room reservations and ensured that everything was in order prior my arrival.
Thank you, it’s a job well done !

I also would like to commend the ffg Shangri-la staff who had made my stay really enjoyable and rewarding. Ms Joy, Nicole, Juki, Mitch, Princess, Eunice, Cookie of Guest Relations. Ayen, April, Haidee, and George the mole, of Heat restaurant. And last but not the least, the very courteous Concierge guys, Manny, Carl, and Randy.

I have likewise recommended to one of my business guest, also a foreigner, to stay at Shangri-la, Edsa, and he too was impressed on the service that was provided to him. He said that with all the hotels he had stayed at in Asia, this was so far the best, and would be recommending Shangri-la, Edsa hotel to their colleagues as well.
Again, a thank you to Shangri-la management and staff for not letting me down on my recommendations.

"just had 7 night stay at EDSA SGL, firstly check in and out was 1st class service as was the service throughout the hotel, but especially the pool attendants who exceeded expectations.
I was comparing this hotel with the Marriott in pasay near airport.
The room was good and comfortable, but bathroom a little small with bath and shower in one.

Sadly the food was the main thing that was disappointing, even though this is not a western chain hotel like the Marriott, it did not live up to my expectations. Breakfast in heat was lacking in choice of bread and western style food, no mushrooms grilled tomatoes or fried potatoes/ hash brown.
Dinner also in heat was lacking, no salad bar to talk of, again not a lot of western choice, or fresh fruit.

I had one dinner at paparazzi, the quality was good, I had the ribeye, well over priced with a tiny amount of potato and vegetables with it. After I had to go to the bakeshop to fill up as was still hungry, not good after paying p3500 for one main course and one beer.
We are due to return to ESL on Friday 27th. On a pre paid booking for 2nights, but on future visits,though the swimming pool area is better than the Marriott will return to the Marriott as food is far superior.

Normally I would rate a shangri-la property excellent but not this case...I think edsa shangri-la needs a wake up call they have been too complacent thinking they are one of the top hotels which is wrong because everyday should be a challenge to please customers... The room had an old smell to it like it wasn't use for so long. The aircon was facing downwards to the bed.

"We stayed here for 8 nights . Our room was ok but rather small with only a shower - the first Shangri La we have stayed in with no bath ? The hotel has a good selection of restaurants and as other reviewers have said is connected to 2 malls which have a dazzling array of shops/supermarkets/restaurants . The pool is very good but is very shaded most of the day . The gym is very well equipped and the staff are lovely - big shout out to Manny who looked after us so well ! We had use of the Horizon club lounge and would recommend this to anyone - the food was good and varied and the drinks were some of the best we have had in the many lounges we have been in . Our only gripe would be that we were asked our room number at breakfast and in the evening for our whole stay ?
The only criticism we would have about this hotel is that they allow people to smoke outside the doors leading to the pool and gym - they had a confererance on when we were there and we had to fight our way through about 25 people and an enormous smoke cloud - not the healthiest start to the day ?",Food:Comfort & Facilities

The staff were very helpful and friendly, Breakfast in the morning was amazing with the variety of food available the best i have seen. Pool area was nice and clean and very relaxed.

"Stayed for 2 nights for business. I opted for the Value Rate Package"" costingPHP 2,800 per night (USD 70) giving me:
• Complimentary Buffet Breakfast
• Roundtrip Airport limousine transfers
• Unlimited laundry, pressing and dry-cleaning
• Broadband Internet Access
• Free local landline calls
• IDD calls & faxes at cost
• 6pm late check-out
This was a great deal - dry-cleaning and laundry was great as was the airport limo + breakfast.

It will be great to see the renovated fitness center - but still the temporary one is not bad. Note there is a spinning bike with SPD pedals so if you are biking at home you might want to bring your SPD shoes with you.

Breakfast was great: large selection.

Notice that there is a large shopping center next door - if you forgot anything you can most likely get it there.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Edsa Shangri-La is located in a clean part of Manila and in the middle of all the shopping and eating locations. Right next to the hotel are two large malls, if you do want to spend less you can visit Green-hills shopping centre for some great Local bargains (20 mins in taxi).
As I followed UK time whilst in Manila the room service was spot, my room was cleaned daily at 7pm so cleaners didn't disturb my sleep and food was available any time I wanted.
The staff were all very nice from the guards outside to concierge, and to the guy at the elevators.
Garden Suite has a business lounge on the 14th floor, which is great for meetings or if you just want to eat/relax.

Or go tire yourself in the very nice swimming pool or the great gym they have. The buffet btreakfast at the Heat restaurant is great. I suggest you eat a bit late- sort of a ""brunch"" that way you save at the same time really enjoy the variety of good food. We had diner at Senju restaurant where we partook of wagyu steak and whoaw!! Very delicious and fullfilling. I was really full cause of the big serving with great taste. Never mind the price the taste makes you feel good anyway hehe!

"I had to stay for 5D4N due to a recent convention. as soon as I arrived, I had to go to the ballrooms to register for my conference. I needed to meet someone at Dome (a coffeeshop in the mall). So when I was going outside, the attendant who was guarding the area went to me and told me grumpily that I could not exit. I asked where the exit is and he kept saying ""Bawal dito lumabas (You are forbidden to go out here.)"" Hence, I had to ask him again, ""Where do I exit?"" He appeared to be so irritated and motioned me to the other side. The room given to me and my husband was a twin room. Apparently, they didn't have any double beds already. The beds were an inch apart only. On our 4th day, something went wrong with our door that they had to jam it up. They transferred us to another room. I wish they didn't because the aircon in that new room was 2 degrees warmer and there was hair on the comforter. The one in charge was generous enough to give us late check-out for all the hassle. By the way, during breakfast, I was waiting for my turn at the Tapa Station. There was a foreigner in front of me. The cook (Haydee) asked the foreigner for her plate as she placed some of the beef she was cooking on the plate. When it was my turn, she completely ignored me and placed the meat on the service plate. I was left staring at her and told her off. I felt that the cook preferred to provide better service to the foreigner while she ignored me, a local. Their conditioner isn't very nice unlike in Sofitel and Mandarin. Anyway, this hotel is at the center of everything that you need since there are 2 malls surrounding it. They had easy access to the other mall.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

Edsa Shangri-La was a delight to stay for a week on business. I got in early and had Sunday to relax before going to the office. I spent a lovely day at the pool. Had drinks and lunch pool side while enjoying the activity around me. The rooms were well appointed with everything I needed. For being out of town and traveling alone I was always around others and the staff was friendly and attentive. The pool area had lots of children's areas and looked like a slide during other seasons. Even though it was warm weather I order the room service hot chocolate. It was a bittersweet chocolate. It became a regular morning order. What a treat!. I would recommend staying there when in the area.,Food:Comfort & Facilities
"After 4 days in Sofitel, I move to this hotel with my wife and son, stayed 2 nights from 17th, Jan, 2015. our trip to manila was to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.
This hotel is perfect for shopping. Shangri-la plaza is directly connected to the hotel and there is another one(SM mega mall) near. so we mostly went out for shopping.
The room was clean, most staff were nice and kind, professional, also ready to help hotel guest and make them comfortable.
Though I did not eat at the hotel, because there are many good restaurant at the mall, the breakfast at Heat was delicious, compared to Spiral, it offered less selection of food, but taste was almost better.
For the people who will eat outside, I recommend Brotzeit for its sausages and German beer. really good.
At the day of our departure, pope Francis was also left Manila, so we worried about the traffic and then just used hotel airport transfer. price was reasonable, the car was very clean and nice. the driver was courteous and very skillful. so we could get to the hotel without any problem.
Me and my wife had a very pleasant experience from this hotel, and we will definitely want to go back.

"Hi ESL :) I would like to thank you for the good service & food when I did visit your establishment last December 2, 2104. I had a lunch at Papparazzi restaurant. I did order the same Business Set Menu Lunch like what I had last October 27th 2014| I am appreciative because the food and its presentation were so much better. My Tuna Carpaccio Salad had more veggies with the same nice tasty dressing| I loved the home bread because it was soft with the slight taste of onions, I did finish all of the served bakery product with the olive oil & balsamic vinegar mix| My fried salmon Fish is rightfully seasoned and I loved the slightly crisped fish skin with lightly cooked veggies| I am impressed with the new presentation of the cheesecake, the chocolate slice on top is admirable| thank you for the neat Green Tea in Pot, it is cool :) Thank you for the good employees at Papparazzi especially ms Angel who covered my table. I bought some donuts & cheese ensaymada from the ESL Lobby Bakeshop, I did receive a good service from ms Beth & company-the bakery buys were worth my money, my family enjoyed it especially my brother. I praise God for the money spent on my luxury day at ESL, thank you & I pray for more paper. Thank you ESL & see you soon!!

I have been in Makati Shangri-la & ESL in 2 separate occasion and I was able to see a reputable Philippine Senator on its Lobby & He did eat at its restaurants, thank God for the nice people which I get to see on these hotels| Shangri-la Hotel is really a decent hotel to have such people visiting the establishment: God Bless!!",Food:Staff

After hyping it up to my wife (it was our 15th anniversary) we were told that our choice main courses were unavailable (15 minutes after we ordered).

"Stayed in the hotel for a total of 4 weeks on a Business trip. The hotel is beautiful, huge, and well maintained.
Location: just in between to big shopping malls, so you can find just anything you need. Other than the mall, there is not that many places you can go walking (but again, you will find everything in the malls - from supermarket, nice restaurants to fancy brand stores). One of the malls has actually a direct connection to the hotel.
Rooms: nice room, good wifi, good shower, possibility of smoking room!
Swimming pool: AMAZING. Beautifully located between trees, you even forget you are in busy Manila.
Pool bar - 3 for 2 beer promotion! They give you warm towels for your confortable chairs by the pool.
Food: several restaurants, which I didnt have the oppoetunity to try all. Did try breakfast, which is wonderful! So many options that you dont even know where to begin. If your rate doesnt include breakfast, I would say its worthy to pay it to try once (it will be your breakfast and lunch for the day lol). I tried the lobby bar food, which was not that great, same for room service (high price compared with quality - not that special).

Service: nice staff, always smiling. I needed some medication and they provided me a couple before I could go buy some. Was there for my birthday, they gave me a cute teddy bear, chocolats and a birthday card.

Business: my company rate included car transfer every day to and from work!! I've to several hotels around the world, and this was the first! If day went longer in the office, I could just call them and they would come pick me up later without a problem!

Transfer: my only small complaint: one of the times I asked them to picked me up at the airport (as O did some weekend trips) they forget to send me the car.. Fortunately I found a staff from the hotel in the airport, and he was able to find me another car. I did complaint about they forgetting about me, and never got a ""I am sorry"".

Definetly recommend this hotel!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

Breakfast buffet is the best!",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"The Shangrila chain worldwide is known for a very high standard and the EDSA Shangrila fully meets, if not exceeds the standard. Notwithstanding the renovation going on at the time I was there (late November), the lobby was buzzing with activity and one was hardly ever affected by the work in progress. My room was medium sized but very well equipped and furnished. Since I was away most of the day, I didn't really miss the absence of a view and appreciated the comfortable bed and pillows. The staff were invariably smiling and polite and service was excellent. I didn't have much of an opportunity to sample the food but the breakfast spread was lavish. The proximity to a large Mall was very helpful since I had little time to go out shopping. Perhaps the only irritant was the presence of too many young ladies dressed as Santa, peddling Christmas baubles in November. One got a bit tired of continuously declining.

Oh yes - they need to put up more prominent road signs for the hotel. My taxi driver was completely lost and I ended up paying 100 Pesos more for circumnavigating the building, trying to find the entrance.",Food:Staff:Location

"We stayed during the New Year. Checking in was very fast and we were even allowed to get a room before 2 pm. But since there were so many people, the lines to the elevators kept piling up.
Our rooms were very nice although a bit small. There was a welcome plate of fruit, which was good since we hadn't had lunch. With all the chaos, they couldn't find our bags and we had to call several times to get them to open the connecting door to our rooms. Our room had a small sofa which my 6 year-old daughter immediately claimed as her bed, and a small pair of slippers which she adored. So kudos to the staff who prepared the room.
The hotel is adjacent to 2 malls so there is an abundance of food and shopping choices if you are on a budget.
Despite the number of guests the pool area was not so crowded. There a water play area which my kids loved. I just wish the water was heated since it was very chilly swimming in December.
Since it was New Year's Eve, the malls closed early and the hotel restaurants were all full so we opted for room service. It turned out to be a good idea since most of the hotel restaunts served set meals which cost 2500++/set, so we ended up saving a lot. They set up a table in our room so that we could enjoy a nice family dinner.The food was very good with servings good for sharing. We were also able to see some fireworks from our room so overall it was good.
Check out was fast. But it took time before we could get down because the elevators were always full and the valet service took another 30-45 mins.
Overall, it was well worth the price we paid.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

The rooms are comfortable (best pillows I've ever used in my life). The staff was polite and warm and the check-in and check-out process as as easy as could be. Only suggestion- don't use their airport service, its too expensive when compared to going rate. if you walk down the hill to the road there are cabs, and the supermarket around the corner has a taxi stand as well. You will pay 1/4 of the price to get to the airport.",Location:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"This is our second visit to Edsa Shangrila via Golden Circle points. Since its a toss up between Traders hotel and Edsa Shangrila and weve been to both. We chose Edsa Shangrila as the lesser evil.
Anyways, as I mentioned in my first review. I was convinced Edsa Shangrila is a subpar hotel hiding under a Shangrila badge and my second visit reinforced my initial impression.

In my first visit I complained about the mosquitoes and lack of service on the pool area. Boom! Its 1/3/2015 at 5:55pm. My wife are lounging on the pool area. I see mosquitoes hovering around my lounge chair. Big ones. I dont know how the other Shang hotels do it but I havent encountered any pest issues with Boraca, Mactan and Makati's pool or beach areas. The facilities of this hotel should consult with the other better managed Shang hotels.

There is only 1 staff, a girl, giving towels to clients and the guy from the bar. No waiter no nothing around the pool area. We asked one guy who I pressumed was a hotel staff for the menu. He came back and told us to order at the bar. What the heck! We've been to Shangrila Boracay, Mactan and Makati multiple times and this is the only Shang hotel that tell their clients that they have a self service policy. At PHP255 per beer and way overpriced food for the taste and still they ask you to move your butt and get the beer and food from their bar. Where is the service and why the lack of manpower? Again if compared to the other Shang hotels where you'll think staff members will kill themselves to get your order, this one has crappy customer service. My conclusion. This is one mismanaged hotel and the service at most is at par with provincial hotels whose staff does not have a clue on how to make their clients delighted and thus does not deserve the Shang badge. Ultimate fail!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"We started spending New Year's Eve in a hotel when our baby was still a baby, because we didn't want to expose her to smoke from fireworks. EDSA Shangri-la has always been a favorite because of its resort vibe and the fact that it's attached to our favorite mall, the Shangrila Plaza.

This year we booked at the Horizon Club and I must say it's definitely worth it. You can take tea and cocktails in the Club Lounge and get drinks as well. The Lounge also has board games, big screen TVs and a selection of newspapers and magazines.

The rooms were great -- not sure if the standard rooms have sofas but the Horizon room had a comfy one. WiFi was great (3 devices, sometimes all streaming content at the same time), bathroom was immaculate, and I liked that the water kettle in the room was a new and sturdy Tefal kettle. Hubby loved the super comfy bed.

The best part of the stay would have to be breakfast! We like HEAT and the breakfast selections are the best I've seen from among different hotels around the region. This year they also leave the whole Bodum coffe pot on your table so you can help yourself to refills. Makes sense considering HEAT was absolutely packed on January 1. Go early for breakfast if you want a more relaxed vibe.

We didn't swim but noticed that the kids who were swimming seemed to be having a great time with the small water park / play features. We just took a walk to see the koi fish and the fountains, then just had a very lazy rest of the day. :)

Shangrila team was very friendly and responsive considering they were fully booked. I also liked that they had a few nurses onsite -- very handy when I had to ask for a pain reliever (I forgot to bring my own).

Mass-goers will like that St Francis Church is walking distance (less than 5 minutes) and mall-goers will like that Shangrila Plaza Mall is attached via an elevated walkway to the hotel. So very convenient! The mall is closed on New Year's Day though.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"The EDSA Shangri-la is a grand old dame among the 5-star hotels in Manila but became very tired in recent years and could not keep up with swanky new ones. When I was re-acquainted with her mid this year, it had undergone a thorough make-over early this year and was indeed a surprising gem - still the old charm and warm, comely personality but all else new and cozy - and a most comfortable bed... Vianny, at the front desk made sure the welcome was genuinely welcoming, and as a business person, I could easily conduct informal customer meetings at the spacious lobby lounge - a panacea to claustrophobic meeting rooms. Great selection of Italian, Japanese, Chinese and Western cuisine - I say this only because it's easier to invite someone impt over for a meal than spend unpredictable hours stuck in traffic in Manila's increasingly congested roads... has an excellent Business Centre, pool and well-equipped gym... a great place to stay and do business.

I waited a bit longer to check in and out than in other comparably-priced hotels.

The restaurant serves all sorts of stuff, and i really didn't miss anything. There was even a special guest cheff visiting so we got great pizza as well.

The rooms are spacious, clean and comfy. We entered the room to find it didn't have a bath tub, a quick call to the reception and we were being moved down the hall into another room with a tub. The kids loved it!

The service was great, from the reception to the cleaners to the pool attendants, it made our stay amazing.

The kids spent the morning swimming in the pool, it was a bit crowded on a sunday morning, since there was an event, but the kids enjoyed their time swimming, playing in the water playground and going down the water slide.

We had breakfast at the pool, and was a great way to end our stay.

Its a great place to take the kids, have some fun, eat some good food, get a good nights rest within the city.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I LOVE this health club! if you're like me and the description of the best club are as follows: clean, state-of-the-art equipment, not crowded, and excellent friendly staff- then this is it for you. they have monthly and yearly rates, to fit your requirements. and did I mention that the gym is 24 hrs open!!! now that's convenience galore! :-) and the view is just conducive to a fun workout... oh and they have a really nice pool that is included in the package +++ :-)",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Stayed here 2 nights and there are a few things I noted that they could improve on.
Came during the peak period so it took a while before the staff were ready to serve us. Off the bat, a few things struck me:
1. Distance from lobby to our room was rather far away and it was unfortunate to see that there was only 1 lift available at the time (the other 1 was down). This made the journey from point of check-in to room nearly 20mins! Worse still was that my room was the 2nd last to the emergency exit, so my journey always felt the longest amongst my colleagues. Front desk informed us that the rooms nearer to the lobby were fully occupied so tough luck for us, I guess!

2. When we tried to get a cab from the lobby, the staff were unable to help us claiming that there were no cabs coming in and they would try to get some to turn in. In the end, after 45mins of seeing several other apparently more important guests be given cabs first (apparently they were ahead of us in the queue, even if they'd just arrived at the entrance!), we just gave up and walked out to the main road to flag a cab. That took us a grand total of 5mins to get done.

Other than that, rooms were old but it was rather spacious and comfy and as per Shangri-La's usual standard, breakfast and the service staff there is great. If you're going to stay at this Shangri-La, just remember that location-wise, traffic is rather bad, but that never stops the high occupancy rate there, so do be prepared to be patient during check-in process.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"EDSA Shangri-la is still the best hotel in the area. Good location. Very accessible. Luxurious. Spacious rooms. Comfortable beddings. Neat. Well-stocked. Great food. Secured and private. Well trained and accommodating. Indeed, some rooms may still be renovated, the parking problems may still be improved. But overall, EDSA Shangri-la is still the best. I will always come back and will never get disapponted.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed her for two nights in a Horizon club room and was I disappointed when I saw the room the only thought in my head is a very drab room the room is crying out for refurbishment even the bathroom is dull and past its life,also disappointed to see that the L'occtaine products have been replaced by cheap inferior products this is a shame as Shang was renound for providing these high class toiletries.The longe was a big disappointment one of the girls was very friendly whist the waiters were good at their job they just were very cold towards guests and the food in the lounge was very very poor perhaps mini sandwiches should be included so that there is a choice for everyone.on this occasion I do not think the club room was worth the extra money and I actually would not stay here again.Heat was ok but nothing special!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I stayed here with my 1 yr old daughter for the weekend. Overall, it was good but could be better. To be fair, i normally stay at the horizon club floor so maybe my expectation was a bit higher.

Check-in was fast since i already called ahead of time. The person checking us wasnt so friendly. There was no warmt. she seems almost mechanical. Our room wasnt ready yet. so she offered if we want to upgrade to the newly renovated tower rooms for only 500++/nite. I took the offer which was a good thing.

The rooms were a lot better than the old ones. It was more roomy and brighter. The toiletries were better. Initially though our room keys didnt work. One better feature security-wise is that you would need your room keys to go to only an specific floor.

We had breakfast ad dinner at the heat. Food was okay. Enjoyed the seafood but the dimsum was not good.

Enjoyed the pool with my daughter. We were there early so not much ppl yet. The lifeguard on duty was very friendly.

One disappointing thing was there ""kids activity"". It was fish feeding, but basically, its just throwing some bread crumbs at the fish pond. I think they can come up with more exciting activities for the kids.

I miss staying at the club floor where everyone is very friendly and warm. But overall, its still my favorite hotel in manila.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Our family stayed here last year during my birthday and we are going to stay again this year! They are so thankful that I introduced them what is 5-star hotel.

I am grateful with this hotel because it's 5 minute walk to malls. Staffs are also so friendly and very much elegant. Their chambermaids are also so kind.

I like best is the Heat restaurant and Summer Palace - I enjoyed the authenticity of the food and numerous selection of food from Asian to western food and I like the halo-halo.",Food:Location:Staff
"I seem to be on a roll lately. The past 2 hotels I've been to, this one included, have been pleasant surprises. I am surprised because, I didn't expect them to have such endearing personnel. In my experience, hotel staff, more often than not, do not go beyond being courteous.

We stayed in a room with two double beds. The only negative was that this room was smaller than those of hotels where we've attended previous medical conventions. Those hotels had bigger rooms with two queen-sized beds. But other than that, everything else was wonderful.

First, the room was clean and very well appointed.

Second, wi-fi is free, is very, very fast and could be accessed in your room and throughout the hotel.

Third, convention aside, the hotel's location is hard to beat. It is situated smack in the middle of two huge malls with tons of food choices for lunch and dinner. Breakfast for two on the other hand, is included with the rate of the room. If shopping is the order of your stay, you won't be disappointed.

Lastly, ninety-nine percent of those that work here that I came across were very helpful and were exceedingly nice while doing it.

Starting with those at the entrance door and the concierge who I pester everyday for parking tickets, to the guy who did a good job cleaning our room daily and kept asking me if there is something else that he could provide us with; from the wait staff at HEAT that attend to you with a smile every morning, and to the staff manning the desk beside the elevators in the Garden Wing who extend that smile throughout the day, everyday, till you check out; everyone was genuinely friendly while doing their job.

I have to admit though that the car valets, while courteous, appeared unprofessional in going about their job.

Overall, EDSA Shangri-la is a property worthy of the Shangri-la name which people associate with top-notch service and a quality stay. I'd recommend it to anyone.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"LOCATION: This hotel is located in one of Metro Manila's business districts: the Ortigas Business District. It is the best hotel in the neighborhood, and is attached to a high-end shopping mall (Shangri-La Plaza) and is walking distance to SM Megamall, other shopping areas and many offices, including the Asian Development Bank. Shangri-La Plaza Mall is directly connected to the MRT Ortigas station, so access to the Makati Central Business District is also easy (except during rush hour--prepare to be packed). For tourists interested in history though, this is not the area you would be interested in. Airport transfers can be arranged via the hotel.

ROOMS: The recently-refurbished rooms impressed us with the excellent lighting scheme. The rooms are bright without being glaring, and there are lights for working at the desk or reading in bed. There are multiple plugs and USB chargers on the desk panel for the needs of the road warrior or average modern hyperconnected guest. Yes, Wi-Fi is free.

While the room is functional, it is warm and inviting, with pretty floral panels on the walls above the beds, comfortable beds, and feather pillows for a good night's sleep after a day of work or shopping.

The bathrooms are clean. Some rooms have wonderful walk-in rain showers with a seat, while some have tubs. You may wish to specify your preference on making the reservation. And oh, if you're here in business with a tight schedule, you may appreciate the clock in the bathroom, aside from the one next to the bed.

RESORT-LIKE ASPECTS: Guests more inclined towards R&R will appreciate the oasis-in-the-city offered by the garden/ pool area, which has children's and adults' areas, with water slides and longing chairs. The CHI spa is also onsite, and if this is like other Shangri-La CHI spas, it would offer some ultra-luxurious pampering. Some of the areas of the hotel are still undergoing renovation, so please inquire if you have specific questions, such as gym access, etc.

DINING: Our rate included buffet breakfast at Heat, which provided a wide range of choices from Eastern and Western favorites. The coffee was excellent-- a house blend supplied by a Philippine-based coffee roasting company that uses choice local and imported beans. Heat and the other hotel outlets are also dining destinations in their own right among locals.

NOTE: The hotel is also popular for conferences and events. These are usually at the lower lobby, but check-in and check-out lines, as well as breakfast lines, may be busy during big events.

Overall, this hotel is the best bet for luxury in this part of town, and one of the contenders for best in Manila. This was our first time to stay at the hotel, and were concerned that the reality would not live up to the hype. But we were pleased to find that the Shangri-La's reputation for excellence is well-deserved, although front-line service at the restaurants is not as good as it was when the hotel first opened.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Metro Manila is a city of contradictions, of poverty and luxury. Mandaluyong represents the top end as far as neighborhoods go and in Mandaluyong the Edsa Shangri-La is a top hotel. In terms of attractions, Mandaluyong is not particularly interesting. It has its mega-malls (so loved by the filippinos) and good restaurants (several of them in the Shangri-La and its adjacent mall).

The hotel itself is big, luxurious and well managed. The lobby is impressive with its chandeliers and panoramic windows to the lush garden. The rooms are very comfortable with good bathrooms. The large swimming pool area is very nice, although one cannot quite escape the traffic noise outside, as the pool is on street level. The variety and quality of food - from Filippino to Western to South Asian to sushi to Chinese - at the breakfast buffet is stunning. Staff everywhere are competent, efficient and friendly.

The only fact that took away one star from the rating is that I happened to stay there at a time when major conferences or meetings were held at the hotel. That caused lengthy lines to the spacious breakfast room in the morning, and equally long waits to get a table for aperitifs at the lobby lounge. Presumably for the same reason, the second floor bar was also closed and used for meetings during my stay.

Finally, for those like I who come to town to work with or have meetings at the ADB, the location couldn't be better. It's just a 10 minute walk to the Bank.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"My husband booked us for an overnight stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We got the newly renovated room at the top floor. Unfortunately, we missed the bathtub like we used to have. Other than this, and as expected, we enjoyed our stay in a luxury hotel with all its amenities. We even had a bonus---a slice of anniversary cake!

This hotel not only boast of a resort-type luxury which is so child-friendly: kiddie pool, slide and wet playground; it has a clear and clean adult pool complete with a lifeguard on duty. It also has its own spa and gym area. Added factor is the adjacent Shari-la Plaza which can be reached through a covered walk from the hotel. There is also a hassle-free WiFi access inside the room.

It is currently undergoing renovation so the usual semi-private access to the pool is now the only access to the elevator. Many areas under construction were covered with printed tarpaulins.",Comfort & Facilities

"Stayed for 4 nights on a business trip from the UK and was delighted with my first experience of this hotel. Check-in was efficient and friendly, and I was also shown to my room. The room was wasn't overly large but more importantly it was spotlessly clean and well appointed. The small downside was the view, which faced onto a large office block across the road. However, given I was there on business, this wasn't really an issue. I had complimentary access to the Horizon Lounge, which was spacious and offered the usual free food and beverages. Cocktail happy hour is between 5pm and 7pm, for those of you on holiday or those you lucky enough to finish your business meeting soon after 5pm. There were various restaurants within the hotel and other bar areas, so definitely something for everyone. I would recommend the restaurant Heat. I'm not a major fan of buffets, but this place offered cuisine from many different countries but the majority of it was made freshly as you waited. Delicious. The trip was made more enjoyable by the staff who were all incredibly pleasant and always willing to help. It's definitely somewhere I'd come back to if here on business again.",Food

"Hotel has excellent staff who are very friendly and efficient, the hotel however has been under-going renovations for some time, which makes it a little inconvenient. For example the 4 lifts are down to two making the wait time longer to get to your room, there is a constant paint smell, the reception area is smaller making the book-in and departure process longer. The hotel always seems full, which places extra burden on the facilities which are not running at full potential, maybe while they go through renovations they can ease off on their bookings. I stay at this hotel regularly however I am losing my patience with the renovations ongoing...... Having said this the hotel has a great reputation and have always treated me well, it is a shame I have to mention this, I hope they can finish soon or I will select another hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I have stayed here several times in the past 8 years, my most recent was on September 2014. I have to say the hotel is already showing its age. Good thing that they have started renovating but it was bad for my latest stay there. Check-in was quite confusing as there was no clear front desk. Their computerized check-in program (requiring a digital signature) was also not working so it took a while for me to check in.

The room was still great and well-maintained. I had a comfortable stay. I do agree with another reviewer here that the previous toiletries they provided (L'Occitane) were much better than the current ones.

I loved the convenience of having 2 big malls within walking distance.

Breakfast at the Heat was okay but not too exceptional.

I would love to stay here again. Still, if given the choice I would pick it's sister hotel Makati Shangri-La.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I've stayed in EDSA Shangri-la for 2 days (Oct 24-25) I felt a bit different compare to my previous experience years ago. The security is seemingly not that friendly in giving friendly reminders. The guy who was in concierge (2am of Oct 25) it seems he is in the bad mood when I approach him about the direction maybe because he was entertaining a matured female Korean guest, however, the way he responded to my simple request felt unfriendly. The warm and hospitable were gone (?). Though the food still superb thanks to those who set up in paparazzi and japanese resto in the 2nd level and for making our breakfast memorable (morning of Oct 25). Room attendant in 7th floor (new tower) he's Bryan who was very accommodating and kind.",Staff
"The pool & playground was a hit with my 5 year old. Breakfast at Heat was sumptuous. If you're in for some shopping the hotel is ideally located between 2 malls - SM Megamall (5 minute walk away) & Shangri-la Plaza (connected with a walkway). Shangri-la Plaza Mall also has a link to the MRT thus connecting you to the city of Makati (more shopping). Megamall has a provincial bus station that can link you to Northern Luzon.
The hotel is Located farther from the airport, so do allot additional travel time. Taxi cabs are accessible from the hotel or malls.

I'm actually a local but I do enjoy this hotel's amenities & location & will gladly go back.",Location:Food
I've stayed in several 5 star hotels in metro manila and Edsa Shang is not one of the best. Makati Shang is definately closer to a 5+ hotel vs. Edsa. Edsa is under construction but the rooms are tired and the hotel services are not great. It was raining and the whole section of the htel was under water. Gym under construction and in a temporary spot in the spa area. The really nice feature is their pool and water slides for kids.,Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I stayed in the Edsa Shangri-La for seven weeks earlier this year. It is a lovely hotel and on the whole deserves its 5* status, but it is not as luxurious as the other Shangri-La hotel in Manila, the Makati Shangri-La. That being said, the rooms are of high quality, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and the facilities and restaurants are top-notch. I would highly recommend this hotel to any business travellers in Manila seeking a comfortable stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La twice for approximately 7-10 days each stay. It's a very nice hotel and even nicer staff. The rooms are excellent and comfortable. There's also a large supermarket and high end mall with even more restaurants across the street if you need more variety.
Checking in is a bit confusing as you don't know where to go. Weekends, however, were like being at Disneyland. Children all over the place, screaming and running around. The lines into Heat (buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner) were horrible and eating in there was loud and not a good experience. Several times I went back to my room and just ordered room service.
Be sure to take some dog treats for the on-duty dogs by the entrance, always a bright spot every day.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Had the luxury of staying at the Edsa Shangri-La for a little over two weeks and can only say...WoW! Enjoyed their breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets and only wished they had a wider selection of local fruits but that is a stretch since there were so many options. They had a good mix of dimsum, american, indian, juice bar, noodle bar, egg bar....ohhh so good.

The pool is special and the staff made us feel like home. They have a buy 2, get 1 free beers but there are better deals within walking distance. Lobby food is good and available 24 hours. Will love to come back and stay. If you get the Horizon club upgrade, very accommodating and worth it.

I got eaten up by mosquitos while hanging out by the pool and was recommended to get an ankle bracelet to fend them off. Got bite at least 2-3 times a day. Made me feel special since they fed on me everyday.",Food:Location:Value for money
"I would have never thought to write something negative about a Shangri-la Hotel, but my recent stay in Edsa Shangri-la wasn't certainly a good one.
First of all, even if the hotel is undergoing renovation and most common areas are affected by it, the guests are still charged for a full rate.
The 15 minutes queue for having breakfast in the morning at Heat was a real turn-off and I seriously hope the management will do something about that soon. Also, while the food at Heat is decent, although absolutely not comparable to Circles Makati in terms of choice and quality, the ambience is just plain terrible. It feels like being in a cheap TGI Fridays, and if you try having a meal there you'll know what I mean by that.
The gym has been temporarily moved inside the small and cold round pavilion that serves as a lobby of the Chi-Spa, destroying the ambiance of both the spa and the gym.
The swimming pool isn't designed for laps, it's basically an extension of the kiddie pool (which is very nice). But am not a kid, I train for triathlon and I wasn't really able to train in the 2 days I stayed at Shangri-La.
I don't really understand the layout of the foot traffic from the entrance to the reception. The taxi dropped us at the back of the hotel, which is the preferred drop point of most taxi drivers cause it's just easier and more convenient for them, being right across the Mall. And that's simply NOT the entrance of a shangrila hotel. I have a much better experience in the new Holiday Inn in Makati, which, by the way, is priced at HALF the cost of Shangri-La. The path from that entrance to the reception is absurd and the worst part is that when you get to the reception, you won't even understand it's the actual reception. All you see is 3 small desks which could represent something else, like concierge, guests service, etc...The first time I entered, I just walked past those desks, still searching for the reception. When I reached the main door I realised the 3 desks I passed were, in fact, what I was searching for.
So be ready (again) for long lines at the check-in and at check-out, cause only 3 guests at a time can be entertained by the staff due to the lack of space.
Another bummer is the elevator. Probably due to the renovation works, only 2 elevators out of 4 will actually take you to the ground floor. So if you enter in the wrong elevator, you are forced to get to the second floor and then go downstairs by the escalator.
The rooms are newly renovated and, despite I personally find the colours used to be outdated and out-styled, they are certainly well done.
I decided to stay in Edsa Shangri-la cause most of my meetings these past week were in Ortigas and I didn't want to travel back and forth from Makati Shangri-la every day. However, this is the first and last time I'll stay in this hotel. From now on I'll just cop up with the traffic and hassle of going back to Makati at the end of a long working day. Or maybe I'll just find a better and more fairly priced hotel in Mandaluyong.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We stayed for 5 nights in view of a long business meeting. The hotel is reflective of the true Shangri-la experience. Lots of greenery in the compound, good restaurants, nice swimming pool and even the temporary gym was well organised. I love the choice of pillows, the layout of the room, the bathroom and the daily generous breakfast. The hotel location is conveniently located next to two shopping Malls. The service from the start to the end was attentive and special mention should go to the front desk and reception staff who were most helpful with our queries. I ate at the Summer Palace restaurant and it was one of the best Chinese meals I had in the Philippines.",Food:Location
"This is a lovely modern hotel with well-appointed rooms and common areas. The restaurant is fantastic with many options to choose from. But the highlight of this hotel, without a doubt, is the staff. You would have to travel far and wide to find employees who care as much as these folks do. And they aren't caring because it's their job. They GENUINELY care about the comfort and well-being of the guests. They are motivated by pride in the hotel, consideration of the guests and a desire to make sure you feel valued. I believe they are very grateful for their jobs, and their work reflects that attitude. They remember your name from day to day... How you take your coffee and what time you leave in the mornings. I stayed for a business trip, and they made me feel right at home.",Staff:Food

"The Edsa Shang is full of amazing staff! They could not be any nicer! I usually stay at the Shang Makati, but this time went for something different. Not only is it less expensive, but if it is possible, the people are even nicer!
Room and bathroom were large and clean, shower even had an overhead ""rain"" showerhead in addition to a normal one. I had laundry done on my last trip, and they were quick and reasonably priced.
Despite this being a business trip, I was there over the weekend so I got to spend some time at the pool and even got a massage. The pool is fantastic, and you do not feel like you are in the city center when you are there. I absolutely felt like I was at an ocean side vacation hotspot! The spa was pricey, but fantastic. I got the hot stone massage and will get one every time I am there in the future!
Because I was there for business, it was important that I be able to sleep during the day as I work overnights. The window shades are great and allow you the ability to nearly block out all light. Also, they have a do not disturb light which prevents any calls or other interruptions from disturbing you.
I highly recommend them!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Manila was quite unlike what I expected from its name. The city reminded me of 1970s Bombay (India). There was an uncanny charm to the city, the bay area, the hawkers and many street dwellers. My drive to Edsa was quite unexpected but the hotel was an oasis.
Edsa Shangrila won't disappoint you. Its lush green backyard, the plush rooms facing the cityscape and the food.
I dined at the cafe and we all ordered for a buffet. It was my longest meal so far. We ate for 4 hours, quite non stop. So you can imagine the food was just too good. (Considering my average meal time is less than 15 minutes)
Furthermore, if you are a business traveler looking for some distraction you can hop into the mall the next door, it has a good collection of stores to keep you resisting from touching your wallet.

"I have been staying in Edsa Shangri-La consistently almost every month since early 2013. I always book the hotel limousine and generally on arrival I am escorted directly to the room for check in. I was given to understand that this is the general norms for guests who avail the hotel limousine service. Unfortunately, during my visit in September and last week (7th October), I was not escorted to the room for check in. I could see similar service being provided to other guests who had availed hotel limousines but in my case there was none.
On my departure day I came to the reception at 5.15 am in the morning and found only one person attending check out process for the guest. He was already busy in checking out another guest and I had to wait for more than fifteen minutes for someone else to come and attend me. This too happened only after repeated calls from the lobby staffs over walkie talkie on my insistence. I had a 7.30 am flight to catch and my whole purpose of coming to the reception early in the morning was defeated.
I guess I am being taken for granted for staying regularly in Edsa Shangri-La and perhaps it is an indication that I should start looking at other hotels in future.",Staff
"This was my third visit to 'The Shang' and probably my most enjoyable.
As soon as I arrived I was whisked up to the Horizon Lounge for my check-in with a nice cold beer. Check out on departure was also a simple process.
Services I used and enjoyed included the complimentary shoe shine, The Horizon Lounge, Buffet Breakfast at Heat and the great housekeeping and turn down service.
My hours at the hotel were sporadic depending on my work schedule but it was interesting to see work going on in the middle of the night which was unnoticeable in the morning- no workmen or debris at all. It's good as the hotel does need this constant attention to continue to stand out.
What stopped me giving a 5 star rating was the poor service in the lobby. On three separate occasions I sat down for a drink but nobody approached me to take my order. Also the car service, provided by Hertz, just doesn't live up to the high Shangri La service. They don't acknowledge customers in the same way as the hotel and on one occasion tried to charge me double the price for the same journey I had taken earlier in the week. It's an expensive service as it is and I wonder if it's time the hotel should review the arrangement with Hertz.

"As you step into the lobby, you can immediately feel and experience the brand that is Shangri-La. Opulent lobby, attentive staff and efficient front desk.

Room is modern and has all the basic amenities you need. We had a King bed and the bed is literally huge. Pillows and linens are extremely comfortable. I would say I had the best sleep amongst other hotels here. It has floor to ceiling window overlooking the city.

Location is ideal as it is near the airport (approx. 30 mins on a regular Manila traffic), along very popular EDSA road and is within the business district of Ortigas. Just next to it is the upscale Shangri-La mall and a few minutes walk is the SM Megamall known as one of the biggest in the Philippines. Bars and restaurants are just around the area.

The price of this hotel is on the above average rate compared to others. But this is Shangri-La so the experience is worth it. If you are a budget traveler, you can get one star less than this at half the price.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Value for money

"I have been staying here regularly for about 10 years now! While the hotel staff is great and friendly it seems new management is all about business which I can understand. Upon check in and a warm welcome back our room was satisfactory but surely little of an upgrade as expected.
With lots of luggage there was no floor space to walk in the small room.
The next day I spoke to some staff and got comments about the new management so finally I did meet the new manager and appreciate his time to meet as I am sure it is busy there. I explained I don't stay much with Shangri-La as other chains treat me better even I am traveling more to Asia and none in the USA. He asked me to commit and if I stay more I can earn more benefits like I get from other chains. I can understand this system but I already have my favorite chains and well rewarded so I saw no reason to switch. Even I planned a return stay a few days later but decided my business was not valued so I tried Marriott Resorts. Turns out I was given a beautiful modern suite and more amenities for the same price.

"I stayed here for two days with my wife. The newly renovated rooms are really nice. The bathroom mirror doesn't fog when taking a warm shower. There was a little problem with one of the elevators. It doesn't go down to the lobby so if you happen to be in that elevator, you have to transfer to another just to go down to the lobby, a little waste of time and effort. On my last day of stay, I was asked at the HEAT resto if I wanted coffee or tea, I said coffee but it never came. I went up to my room, checked out and called it a day. Overall it was fine.",Comfort & Facilities
"I'm a Marriott person and really prefer not to part with the opportunity to earn Marriott points, but during a June 2014 business trip, it made little sense to stay at Marriott only because traffic is insane in Manila and Marriott was too far from my business site to risk the lengthy drive.

The hotel staff is very friendly and amazingly adept at remembering names! I swim laps in the morning and found that, after my first morning of laps, the pool staff was waiting for me to arrive the following morning. It's rare that I find myself at a property where I can swim laps, let alone find one where the staff cares about my morning routine.

I ended up staying in 2 rooms over 8 nights. Both rooms were in the 'Spa' wing - 3rd floor. The first room became progressively stinky due cigarette smoke drifting from floors in that wing that are designated as smoking. I was moved to a room directly across the hall that didn't have the same cigarette smoke smell drifting in.

The hotel is relatively quiet and, although the Spa wing needs updates, it's quite nice.

Heat restaurant for lunch is good, but a little too expensive.

The gym facility is amazing. Great equipment and everything actually works!

There is a Starbucks directly behind the hotel that is a quick in/out. Very nice team and one that I will visit during my next stay.

The Edsa Mall is attached to the hotel and has many dining options. Mall layout is goofy as a result of recent additions. Basically high end stores are in the new area and older, less expensive stores are in the old area. There is a grocery store in the mall where you can grab a few staples. Note that your room will have a refrigerator, which is a huge plus for business and leisure travel.

Mega Mall is within walking distance. More restaurants and a grocery store are available there. I wouldn't add it to my list of 'must see', but it's there if you're in town to shop and/or need a dining fix.

I visited Greenhills shopping mall with locals in tow. My friends did some haggling for pearls on my behalf. I'm not sure that what I purchased was top quality, but it works given the price. I won't revisit Greenhills on upcoming business trip as it's just not that interesting. Lot's of fake purses and other knockoff items that really should not be on the list for any Americans.

On Saturday's it's worth the 3 block walk to the Greenfield Weekend Market if you're interested in purchasing local items that you will not find at Greenhills. It's definitely a nice place to meet local's, taste local food options, sit and chat with friends.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"For the last 8 years that I had been to the Philippines, I have always stayed at Shangrila-Edsa hotel. I have tried other hotels with the same star rating, but nothing has surpassed Shangrila-Edsa in terms of fast and efficient service, food variety and quality, and very efficient and friendly staff. From check-in till check-out, never did I experienced any issues as compared to other hotels. They always gave me the feeling that Im at home, with the added extra amenities of a resort.
The surrounding area is also very accessible to huge shopping malls and restaurants, very convenient indeed.
They have recently made renovations on their lobby lounge and pool, as well as on some of the rooms, which totally shows their commitment to continuous improvement. Kudos to all the Guest Relations team who always wear that warm smile and courtesy. Special mention to Ms. Vianny Siasat who has assisted me and some of our colleagues on our stay there.",Staff:Food

Some parts of the hotel are under renovation and one would expect issues. But my visit has been absolutely seamless. All credit to Patrick Schaub who runs the hotel extremely well. And kudos to the guest relation team run by Joy Reyes. She is incredibly busy, but still finds time to meet and greet you and check if your stay is okay. She and her excellent team make me feel i am coming back ""home"" every time.

The new wing in the hotel is awesome and i would urge people to use it. Its truly amazing. The design is great and the lighting.,layout and upholstery is of high quality.

The hotel still serves the best breakfast, has the best lobby, a great lounge, efficient concierge and above all - professional and competent staff.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Had the pleasure of staying at the Edsa ""Shang"" for 5 nights while in Manila for a conference. The hotel staff remain the most friendly and service oriented staff in Manila. They genuinely care for their guest from the the minute you arrive at the hotel to the time you leave. They go out of their way to ensure you are comfortable and happy.

The lounge off the mail lobby is great for afternoon tea and evening drinks with business associates or friends. Service is relaxed but professional.

Treat yourself and spend a few hours at the pool. It is truly an oasis from the hustle and bustle of Ortigas. Curved lines and extra foliage make for a relaxing stay. A deep, deep end and slash area offers something for every guest.

Hotel has a buffet restaurant (HEAT) that offers more food choices than you can imagine. Excellent Japanese and Italian restaurants are escalator ride away.

Yes you will pay a bit more to stay here, but if you have travel a long way to get to Manila, it is so worth it to be able to say ""ahhh..."" when you know you have arrived in this little spot of luxury in downtown Manila.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Overall, the hotel met my expectations and I had a very pleasant stay. Everyone that I interacted with was pleasant, attentive and professional. I really enjoyed the staff, and the food, at the HEAT Restaurant. The food was on point every time I ate there. Be sure to check out Rico at the egg station in the mornings! The gym staff, as well as the staff at the pool, were absolutely awesome. You could always count on a smile from Apple and Phillip was always there to help me out.

That said, there were a few things that fell short. The Internet kept dropping and I'd frequently lose connection. This of course caused issues while trying to work from the hotel. Also, housekeeping was hit or miss. When I go to Manila I work an overnight schedule and sleep during the day. Despite my telling them this in person (twice), and completing the info sheet that they asked for, they seemed to always come by and leave a ""Sorry we missed you"" card while I was sleeping. What's more, when they did come they frequently forgot to replenish my water, forcing me to go buy water from the bakeshop, the restaurant or the pool bar. I know that these aren't huge, deal-breaking issues (with the exception of the Internet issue) but given that the hotel is billed as a 5-star hotel I would expect not to have these issues at all.

Again, overall a very nice stay but fix the Internet and housekeeping issues and it would have been a great stay. Hope to see all of this fixed for my next visit in March 2015.",Staff:Food
"We spent a night at the hotel to celebrate my 13-year old daughter's birthday.

The hotel has the luxury feel that the Shangri-La brand is known for. Large pool area with slide and a separate play area where kids can run around, squirt water at one another, see-saw, slide, or just stand under the structures that accumulates and pour water. The staff are very courteous and prompt in responding to our needs. Best of all, it's very near Shangri-La Mall where we had lots of options for eats and shopping.

I rate our experience 4 stars, however, because the hotel has a hint of a weary hotel that needs upgrading. Nothing still beats the feel of a new carpet, floor, wall, furnitues,lighting etc. Unfortunately, the room we stayed in looks a little old. Still luxurious, with high quality bed, linens, etc., but old. Which is being addressed, I gather, as seen by ongoing renovations in the lobby. Am not sure if they have plans of renovating other parts, though.

The breakfast buffet offers a large array of choices. Food is good but nothing stands out. The Heat restaurant where breakfast was served can get jampacked. I saw a long queue outside the door as we were leaving. Good thing we had breakfast early in the morning. I haven't experienced waiting in line for buffet breakfast at a luxury hotel.

Overall, we had a relaxing stay and my daughters, especially my 3-year old, had a lot of fun at the pool area.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"EDSA Shangri-la is not the same as it was before..... :( I had wonderful memories of it then. Hotel service is indeed getting worse. Just to ask for tea and coffee which they had not replenished took a pretty long time to arrive. I thought they had to buy supplies from SM megamall that's why I had to wait. Maybe the kitchen had been moved to another building I don't know but it was ages before it arrived. Then I had to use the stirrer because there was no teaspoon available. A first for me. There was a fork, a knife, a breakfast plate and a napkin but the fruits I used to see from day 1 and every day thereafter of my stay were no longer served. Maybe they had to cut on cost. Maybe because I was not a Golden Circle member anymore. My friend did not have an electric water kettle so I lent her the one I had in my room. What was really worse was being ""chased"" by the waiter (twice), once last year and again last May 2014. I do not know why they had to do it each time I was already enroute to the elevator which was really embarrassing! Why chase me to to settle my lunch bill when they knew right from the start that it was already paid for in advance? They had checked it out on the computer and confirmed it before they showed me to my table!",Staff:Value for money:Food
"I'm not a big fan of this type of hotel but I got 2 free nights' stay from a friend's rewards. It's quite nice, a little on the luxurious side. I think that's my problem with it. Everything is pricey! A bottle of ""cheap"" wine at their lounge cost us $55 USD.. that's expensive even in the US! And this is the Philippines! It's a little obscene esp since just outside there are starving people everywhere. I don't think the regular Filipino can afford to stay here. I am sure this is mostly for tourists and foreigners. So if this is your kind of hotel, by all means, do stay here.

It is located between 2 malls. SM Megamall is the largest in the Philippines. And then there is Shangri-La Plaza with more high end stores. So you can shop til you drop here. The pool area is really nice, that was my favorite. It almost made me love the place LOL. Location-wise in Manila, it is quite far from everything else. Such as the airport. In Manila traffic (which is the craziest in the world I think!), it will take you 1-2 hours to get to the airport. There is a Shangri-La in Makati which is more central location and closer to airport. But that is even more expensive.

Oh and they have a huge breakfast buffet. That will set you back $35 USD. Again, that is more expensive than most hotel breakfast buffets in the US! You come to the Philippines to save money not spend it! Anyways, for me this is just average and not my preference. But it is a nice hotel.",Value for money:Location:Food

"We've stayed a number of times at the Edsa Shangri-la but the last trip in early September wasn't as pleasant as it used to be. Don't get me wrong, the room and facilities are still superb, including all the amenities; it's just that they somehow fell short of expectations in terms of service. I don't recall having stayed on the phone for that long just to connect to guest relations, there were missing stocks in the room and it took - without exaggeration - about 45 minutes just to get some water in the room. There were some other quite minor hiccups but overall, this won't sway me against coming back, although probably in a different location (Cebu or out of the country, perhaps). It's just always nice to stay here when you know you've got to do some shopping at the mall connected to the hotel itself. Thanks by the way for the moon cakes.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location

They were all presentable & properly mannered. Their warm greetings & conversations encourages me to keep on visiting them. I did have lunch at Papparazzi & it was really worth the travel & money. I learned a lot of new things from their Hotel like-Italian dishes & how they are being presented in a classy way, Well-made Art: there was an exhibit at the lounge by an old Painter ( I think it was Anita Magsaysay-Ho), some Italian words which I have to be familiar with for I have plans of dining in at Papparazzi often, & how to interact in politeness with ethics to their staff & crew :D I like their manual toilet-practical yet cute, the place is pretty decent & reasonably clean.

"I would regard this as one of the classic hotels - probably does not suit someone that prefers more modern lifestyle boutique hotels.Always greeted by the plentyful staff wherever you are in the premises. The reception staff however , seem to need more training as the process to check-in was took quite long to complete , which is not something you wish for after a long flight. I also asked for a garden room which they agreed to - but received something else as I got into the room. I changed it later but still abit annoying. The window outside was also extremely dirty so I removed one * for that.

It's also near Shangri-La Mall, and Mega Mall if you want to go shopping.

I stayed at the Edsa hotel on two occasions, and they make me feel like I am at home (or even better). The entire staff (from the desk clerks to the maintenance crew) are very nice and respectful. They always greet you with a smile and a ""morning/evening maam"" and are always ready to assist you.

The food is good and they have a variety of items for various diets (e.g. Japenese, Phillipino, and Western menus). They make sure your food was to your liking and if not what can they do make it better. I love the french toast served at the Horizon Lounge and I cannot wait to go to the breakfast buffet offered by the Heat restaurant. The room service arrives on time or earlier.

The hotel has a beautiful swimming pool and a fitness center. The location I stayed at is great as there are many shops within walking distance such as Mercury Drug, Starbucks, and there is a bridgeway that connects visitors to the Shangri-La Mall.

"The hotel is essentially everything you can expect from a 5-star hotel in the center of an Asian large city. Great service overall, directly connected to a mall and with great dinning options.

A few mentions:
a) The fitness center: during my stay the fitness center was under renovation - so the hotel informed me that they had created a temporary facility in the SPA. Well I have to say that the facilities in the Spa was fine - and larger than most normal hotel gyms (4-6 cardio, 4-6 weight stations and free weights). Yes it was a bit crammed - but still considering that this was temporary I was impressed with the options.
b) The breakfast: Fantastic: The range and quality of breakfast options was among the very best I ever have seen - noodle station, egg station, western option, indian, chinese, pancake station, 4 juices + 3 types of fresh smoothies, sushi station, cakes - you get the picture.

"Recently had a 6 week stint in this hotel for a business trip.

Was the first time I have been to Shangri-La hotel and can say that I was quite pleased with the stay. There were some good and bad things.

The building -
The hotel on the outside right now is a building site because 2 large apartment blocks are just being finished off to the side that have obscured the west view of the city. Also with the SM Mega Mall in front of the main entrance, it actually feels like the front door is the side entrance of the hotel. However once within the ground it is quite pleasant. The lobby is clean and the pool area round back makes you forget that you are in the center of a large city.
Having the Shang Mall and The MegaMall right next to the hotel is fantastic! We could go to each on our days off and get some supplies for the room. Having them was our saving grace when we had some downtime!

The Room -
I was originally placed into a Garden Wing room, despite booking one in the Tower Wing. The room was on the 5th floor and seemed a little dated with brown wood furnishings and the lights giving off a yellow glow. Felt like a room from the 70's. Though it was still comfortable. However after the first couple of nights I did notice a damp smell upon entering my room each night and because it was above a function room, noise could be heard on the balcony (i think) when a function was on. I requested to move to the Tower Wind where my colleagues where and the staff were more than happy to do this for me.
I was put in room 1814 (Top floor facing north). The room was fantastic. The view over north of the city was great and it was definitely advantages to have a walk in shower. Internet does slow down on weekends but I think this is down to some guests filling out the rooms and everyone using up all the bandwidth. The only problem with a top floor room was that any work being carried out on the roof could be heard. There was the odd hammering sound heard from time to time. Housekeeping always kept the room clean and would always wish you a good day should you pass them in the hall.

Service -
During the day, the service is brilliant. The Staff are always smiling and willing to help. having lots of other guests walking around clearly made the Hotel seem better and successful. The girl at the bakeshop and the Avis desk would always greet me by my name and this made the service at this part feel much better. However as soon as night descended, the service became really bad. We would work a late shift so we would return back at the hotel at 00:30 each night. The place was dead (as it would be) and so we would go to the Horizon Bar for a drink and a snack. TAKE NOTE, if you want anything from here make sure you have a spare 2 hours. Service was always slow and you would have to ask for everything 4 times, even then it would come back wrong (ask for a vanilla milkshake, you will get a fresh orange). A drink could take anything from 10-20 mins to arrive, food 30 mins, then the bill was another 10. This is mainly down to staff having to recall everything in their mind's and not writing down orders. If there was an open bar near, we would have gone to that. Cocktails were nice mind you.
Another example of service that did annoy us was that we asked reception if they sold Hong Kong Dollars (as we were away to HK for the weekend) The guy on reception said that they did and I asked for £100 worth. Obviously he didn't know how to covert it so I just asked for 7000 peso worth of HKD. I confirmed it 3 times if he could do it and he said yes. Then he stood there like a Lemon. He thought I was going to give him 7000 peso worth of HKD. I corrected him and then he placed 7000 peso in my hand. I said to him that it was HKD I wanted and then he said, ""sorry we only have peso here"" fantastic..... I lost £30 due to his uselessness in exchange fees. Should have just waited till I got to HK. The service, I would say overall is pretty bad in the early hours, I think it may be that they put the grumpy, rubbish staff out at this time so little interaction would be had with customers.

Golden Circle -
A little addition here after receiving my points back. The company does screw over long stayers. The longer you stay, the less points you get. You also are illegible for any offers (Double or triple points). Seems a bit unfair, considering I paid about £5-6k for this stay..... Hilton at least honors its longer stayers. I barely got any nights to stay in Shang hotels because they are so expensive.

Conclusion -
Despite some of the groaning here I did enjoy my stay in my room and did feel like being at home every night when retiring. I think what really spoil it (and why I only gave 3 stars) was because of the service we received after hours from Bar and reception staff. It really did annoy me about the currency fiasco.",Staff:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

Upon reaching the hotel I was greeted by the duty manager and was escorted straight up to the room, where the check-in was done in room and in under 2 minutes. Perfect! especially when you arrive late in the night.

Those things are great but the WOW experience was because of this - after I reached the hotel, I realised that I had forgotten my business formal shoes in the previous hotel that I was staying at (in Malaysia) and now was in a panic mode, since I had a meeting next morning at 9am and was informed that no shops in Manila open before 10am. So I requested the duty manager ""Noli"" for his help - he went above and beyond the call of duty and was able to arrange a pair for me for my meetings next morning.

"I went in early August 2014 with my wife and 2 young daughters, for 3 nights. The moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and pleased with how staff. Here's my quick review:

Cons:
1. The room window had a permanent mist or condensation for 3 days, and the 10th floor window sits right above a ledge the blocks the view of the pool. So, the promised pool view was illusory - you can only see the pool if you stand on a chair and look down.

2. The gym is under renovation, so it was temporarily located at the spa. It's cramped and dark.

3. The restaurant Heat is a treat. The variety is impressive and the taste ranges from good to very good. But it's very pricey. Expect to spend $50 (US Dollars) per person for the buffet with a non-alcoholic drink. You can find other good options outside the hotel for lesser price, but it won't be as convenient.

Pros:
1. The staff, the staff, and the staff. Apple and Leo at the pool, Anthony and Norman at the Horizon Lounge, are just a pleasure to deal with. They are polite and just good folks. The next day, they remember your preferences as if they've been dealing with you for a long time.

2. On Wednesday and Friday, the artist playing in the lobby was Megan Aguilar. Not only is she very impressive, she is perfect for that loungy sound which you need to relax after a long day. The lobby staff was a bit stiff but maybe that's what they are told to do. But smiling a little won't hurt.

3. The pool caters to the children. It had a nice playground installation and awesome water slide. The staff (Apple and Leo) were really good with the kids. The water slide is long but it feels safe.

4. My wife tells me the Chi Spa is amazing. It's notches below the Mandarin Oriental in NY but for the price and quality, we'd choose Chi Spa any day.

5. We felt secure in the hotel. The security was not too intrusive but they do a great job of screening people (and cars) that come in to the hotel. You'll feel safe here with your kids.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff

"This is one place that my family usually gather to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, or special events. Being a gourmet club member for the past years, I always thought that even if we don't get to use all the vouchers, at least being a member gives us some incentive to dine in Heat or summer palace, since my children always enjoyed eating in these fine dining places. However, the past 2 to 3 times we have dined in Heat has not been at all satisfying nor was it gastronomical, to say the least. I really cannot comprehend if it is intentionally done but somehow I do believe that this restaurant is trying to cut corners when it comes to their dishes. Like for one recent incident, when I asked if they serve Ebi tempura which my daughter loves to eat, they said YES but somehow, the dish didn't appear until maybe an hour after lunch has been served. When my husband asked what was taking so long to serve it and the chef answered that ""the prawn was still frozen""! hello!!!! And when they served it an hour and a half later, my daughter had to request for it. Somehow I felt that if we didn't ask for it, it will never be served. cutting corners or being cheapskate.....but we are not paying cheap price here!!!!! Weekend lunch costs 2.5K nett per head....and we can't even have Ebi tempura? Also, the sushi dishes and sashimi, the rice used here seem so wet and old already, not the Japanese rice that we would expect...it just turned me off. Even the tuna and salmon sashimi, you can see in the colors of the fish that they were not fresh at all.....and how about their noodle station, my husband wanted to have mushroom part of his soup but the chef didn't even offer it when he inquired it. Another example of cutting corners.....And how about the green tea? They used to serve this every time we dined there. But for the past several times we have dined there, whenever I asked for this, the waiter comes back giving us a different tea, always telling us that they have no more green tea to serve. But why? Don't they know that green tea is highly in demand by diners? If they truly want to make their diners happy, they should always make it a point to have stock of this tea as well and not come up with lame excuses that they ran out of this. The last time we ate there, which was just last weekend, I told myself I didn't want to eat in Heat anymore. Not even the dessert was worth coming for, especially if the taste of the pasties and cakes were plain, dull, dense and artificially sweet, definitely not at all worth to be part of the kitchen of Shangrila...a true disappointment indeed!",Food:Value for money:Staff
"We recently went to EDSA Shangri-La to look for a good venue for our company events. I like how EDSA Shangri-La offers a paradise in the middle of the very busy business district. I liked the abundance of plants, the fountains, the pool, and the garden in the middle of the property.

The moment we got to the hotel, we were welcomed by the very attentive hotel staff who opened doors for us and led us to the front desk. Everyone was very courteous and respectful. Everyone looked pleasant and were always smiling. I also liked that their uniforms were very Oriental in design.

We went straight to the events hall where we were given a tour of the function halls. There were a bunch of events simultaneously happening so we were not able to check all the rooms of EDSA Shang. With that, I can say that I appreciate the security offered in the hotel considering that a lot of the events that happen in this hotel are attended by both ordinary people and VIPs alike.

After the tour of the function rooms, we proceeded to the tour of the hotel rooms. I liked the ample office space offered in the rooms. It had WiFi, a good TV, and enough power outlets. And I think I like the rooms in the tower room than the rooms in the garden wing because the rooms in the tower room are newly renovated and have a lighter feel.

Lastly, we checked for the available restaurants in the hotel. We saw Senju, Summer Palace, and then there was Heat. I know that EDSA Shang is known for its Heat buffet but since we were there at 11 am, we were too early for the buffet so we ordered food ala carte instead. The menu did not disappoint. We went with our Indian boss and it's good that there was an Indian section in the menu and he liked the food. We got pizza as well and chocolate cake.

With the prime location, the good service, great facilities, and sumptuous food, EDSA Shangri-La is now in the top of our list should our company host an event in the future. We will definitely go back.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"After earning points on our Shang Makati, Shang Mactan and Shang Boracay stay this year, we decided to spend some of our Golden Circle points on an overnight stay in Edsa Shangrila.

Having a Shang badge, I had high expectations on the kind of service the hotel has. However, I am now leaving the hotel disappointed with an impression that I stayed on a so-so hotel hiding under a Shangrila badge or maybe I had the wrong impression that I stayed on a 5 star hotel and this is their ""budget"" hotel. Whereas in other Shang hotels, the staff and the level of service makes you feel important and pampered thus you want to stay longer or come back again for some more ""Shangrila experience"", Edsa Shangrila makes you feel average and neglected. If you want to ruin your Shangrila experience, I think this is just the hotel to do that.

Few observations why I consider this a poor/average hotel.
1) Checked in at 3:30pm due to the EDSA traffic and the room was not yet ready.
2) Problem with maintenance and pest management. The pool area had a mosquito problem. I had mosquito bites and so did my wife while in the pool area. An issue that we did not encounter in their more exotic hotels -- Shangrila Boracay or Mactan stay. (note: mosquitoes on the pool's mens CR as well)
3) Pool area attendants were nowhere to be seen (July 26, 2014 : 5 pm) Guests weee told to approach the bar area for orders. First time I encountered this on a Shangrila hotel. Shang Makati and Boracay have a platoon of attendants to assists you in getting towels and in this hotel they dont have one Maybe they should hire more. In hindsight, it was drizzling and maybe they were like MMDA officers who suddenly disappear when its raining.
4) At checkout, we were asking for a utility bag (which every Shang hotel has) from the staff for our wet clothes and got a garbage bag instead. BOOM! End of story. Our stay officially sucked.",Food:Staff

"One of the advantages of staying in this hotel is its location. It's very near shopping malls, restaurants, the MRT, and everything else, so you wouldn't need to travel far to find whatever you need during your stay.

Service was also superior in this property, as expected from a Shangri-La hotel. Check-in was fast and easy during our stay, and the hotel personnel were very attentive and responsive to our needs. We specified our requests for our room, and all of these were complied with by the reception.

Of note, our stay in one of their newly-renovated tower wing rooms was very relaxing. The room assigned to us was really posh and modern, complete with a very comfortable bed, down pillows, and modern fixtures. It's also well-lit with plenty of natural light coming from the windows and warm accent lights in the room. Apart from this, we had a pretty nice view of the garden from outside our window, which was a huge plus.

I was also delighted with the toilet and bathroom as the water closet inside was equipped with a bidet, which its sister,Makati Shangri-La Hotel, did not have. Water supply was also not a problem during our stay, and the water heating system was fairly efficient.

There was, however, some noise during the afternoon because the renovation of other areas of the wing is still ongoing, but this was nothing the TV could not cancel out. At night, it was quiet and peaceful.

The property also has a couple of really good restaurants, Summer Palace being our favorite, and many facilities that the guests can use during their stay.

"Shangri La is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in and I've always been a fan of Makati Shang, but the experience in EDSA Shang was just exemplary I believe I have a new favorite. We've stayed here for three times already, first is during good friday then mother's day and the recent one is for my sister's graduation.

I've always loved how cozy the rooms were, the view is just impeccable, whether you have the pool view or those stunning city night lights along EDSA, they are just lovely. The staff were all just so accommodating too, from the valet to the concierge and those who are in the front office specially Lui, she's the one who had been assisting us for all our stay, she's very pleasant and easy to talk to, if you'd be checking in, and you have the chance, I highly suggest that you check in with her.

Aside from the friendly staff, this hotel also has the perfect location, it is in between two malls, on one side there's Shangri La Plaza and on the other side there's SM Mega Mall which are both just walking distance away. Then there's also a church nearby if you'd be staying there on a Sunday, St. Francis Church is also just a few steps away. Aside from that, it may be accessed in two ways as well through EDSA and through C5.

With all these considerations, it would always be my home away from home :)",Location:Staff

"Stayed at this hotel for business because it was near where we needed to be for a meeting.

Hotel web site says ""45 minutes from the airport"" but it actually took over 2 hours by the hotel's car transfer service - not including the 15 minutes or so we spent out in the heat and chaos outside Manila airport, attempting to locate where to actually meet the hotel car we had booked. No directions or contact number provided by the hotel, and definitely not the typical ""holding up a sign with your name on it"" kind of greeting we expected. This may be an issue of the airport's design, with no easy pick up area, but the hotel definitely could give better instructions and/or contact info to compensate for this.

Dinner at Paparazzi restaurant within the hotel was excellent.

We had one meal by the pool - burger, fries, cocktails - which was reasonably good and drinks were well-priced.

Didn't have time to explore the surrounds, but it seems like there are some modern shops quite close by.

Room was not particularly memorable but basically in a good way - everything worked as expected and this seems like a good business hotel. Breakfast looked nice although we barely got to eat anything as we were rushing (our fault).

Long side story here: I had an inconvenient experience trying to post a postcard to my family - front desk could not bill the postage to my room, regardless of price, and they directed me to a different counter. That other counter would only take Pesos, and I had none, so they directed me to somewhere else. There I tried to change just over the right amount of money, but they wouldn't take coins to exchange. Finally agreed to change a Singapore $2 note for the ~40 cents of postage, for which I had to go back to the 2nd counter, wait a while to be served, etc etc... All in all, way too much effort and it would certainly have been a far better service experience for me to have just had a ""yes, we'd be happy to post that for you"" to my first enquiry, billed to the room, almost regardless of what the markup was on the stamp itself. As an endnote to this postcard saga, it took just on one month to arrive in Japan, postmarked about 1 week beforehand - so seems like it could have been ""lost"" in the hotel for up to 3 weeks before being posted, but who knows, maybe that is just an oddity of the Phillipines postal system.

I'm rather hoping not to have to fight through 5 hours round trip of traffic again for a 1 hour meeting in Manila - but if I do need to go to this general area in future, I would have no hesitation to stay at this hotel again, if only for the Italian dinner and knowing the room ought to ""just work"".

And who knows, just maybe the hotel can update the claim to be ""45 minutes"" from the airport, which from what I gather is probably almost never true; and even let me send a postcard home simply at the front desk like I can do just about anywhere else I have ever tried.",Staff:Food:Value for money

Check in: Fast and organized. Valet was waiting for guests so they can park your cars should you bring any. Parking was free for checked in guests

Room: Standard room was not really big, but just enough. Nice view of the city. Comfy sheets and pillows. All toiletries were provided. Just one comment though, there was no tub in the bathroom, but shower works perfectly fine.

Room Service: Fast and great food. We ordered dinner and breakfast in our room and it was delivered on time. Big serving for their breakfast menu. We ordered only 1 Filipino breakfast it was sufficient for 2 people already.

Traffic from here to my office was ok since it's against the flow of traffic.
I find the rooms spacious enough and beds are very comfortable. The pillows come in all sorts of firmness, so I could pick the right one.
There are plenty of TV channels but unfortunately not all of them are clear. I think they can do better with the TV reception on some channels. If not then don't bother offering them.
Kids would love that they have all the kids channels.
The pool is great place for a swim. It has a slide and kids play area too. Families would find that a good thing for the kids. The service at the pool though is not as good, example they would not come up to offer you any drinks or towel and it's leaves you kind of wishing for better service.

"We stayed at the Edsa Shangri-la for 4 days while visiting relatives in Manila. My daughter really enjoyed the splash pad (open until 6pm) and the waterslide in the pool area. These two areas are separate from the main pool, keeping rambunctious kids from disturbing the other guests too much. The main pool is unusual for a hotel in that there is one section that is 9 feet deep, but a lane marker visually separates it from the rest of the main pool which is just over 3.5 feet deep.

For breakfast, we had the buffet at Heat one morning, bought pastries and coffee from the Bakeshop another morning, and ordered room service twice. Kids under 12 years old were free at the buffet which was a pleasant surprise. The food and service at the Heat breakfast were excellent, and a magician was doing tricks tableside on the Saturday that we were there. The pastries from the Bakeshop were excellent too, offering both ""regular"" goods like Muffins and Cronuts to Filipino ones like Ensaymada and Macapuno Croissants. We ordered room service using the pre-order hang tag that you leave outside your door at night. They delivered it promptly at the time we had marked, and the American breakfast was so big that the 4 of us were able to share 1 meal. The food was hot upon arrival.

The hotel room was standard for a 4 star hotel. I liked that the desk included 2 USB ports for recharging devices. My one complaint is that the double beds looked bigger in the hotel website photos. From the picture, I was expecting the wider ones typical in American hotel rooms and thought that 2 people would fit on each one comfortably. They were actually the standard Asian double bed which was a bit more difficult to squeeze in 2 people for sleeping. The gap between the 2 beds was quite small, so at least I didn't have to worry about a kid falling off onto the floor. He would have simply been wedged between the beds. I wasn't sure if there was enough space in our Deluxe Tower Room for an additional roll away bed to be brought in, so I didn't ask.

Checking in and out were both easy and fast. They originally gave me a King size bed even though I had booked a Double but quickly found me a room with a double.

The hotel is in a good location adjacent to the Shangri-la Plaza mall. A Jamba Juice is just across the street from the hotel side entrance, and a Starbucks is shortly after that. The mall has many restaurants and nice stores. The SM Megamall is only 5 minutes away, but I was advised by my relatives not to walk there.

I just wished they had more people answering the phones. The only problem I had was trying to reach the front desk from the phone in my room. You had to let the phone ring for several minutes before someone answered. Only a minor inconvenience. The pool area was also a nice distraction after a long day/night working. They did a great job updating the pool.

The hotel was extremely accommodating that I had to work at night and sleep during the day. They even arranged that the maids would clean the room between 1am and 3am.

There are tons of options for shopping near the hotel. If you want high-end try the Shangri-La Mall. If you want huge variety of stores make sure to visit Megamall. The name is accurate, it is huge.

"Just stayed here over the weekend using our Club Gourmet Voucher for Chi Premier. Since Chi Premier rooms are no longer available, they upgraded us to Horizon Club. With this, we are able to get a lot of complimentary items like high tea in the afternoon, cocktails in the evening, midnight snacks, all day drinks, free suit pressing, etc... I came in as early as 10am, plan to check in, settle and come back at 2pm to literally check in, in my room but since room was already ready then they told me I can already use it. The Horizon Club rooms I think are still not renovated but still it was super clean and comfortable. Edsa and Makati Shangs are entirely different, I like that Makati Shang is more of a tight and upscale business type and you have Edsa Shang as your relaxed and family friendly resort hotel.

We had the option to have our breakfast in either Heat or Horizon Club Lounge. We tried Heat as it has more selections for breakfast but didn't like the vibe as it was a bit crowded. I'm used to dining in Circles but even if they're fully booked, I don't feel that the restaurant was crowded at all.

First, the room had excellent mattresses and linen sheets with at least 400 thread count. It was very clean when we entered the room, and very quiet...no noise from neighboring rooms. We stayed in the Garden tower. They had more than enough towels for us and the toilteries were not your run-of-the-mill shampoo and conditioner because they smelled great.

Second, the pool was excellent. Not only was the water very clear (i.e. not murky as compared to another 5-star hotel we stayed in) but they also had a water playground where kids can play under fountains of water. The pool had lush vegetation surrounding it, which added to the tropical island appeal.

Third, the service was excellent. Everyone was just ready to greet you with a smile..and willing to help. I went to the gym and they were very helpful with the machines and the jacuzzi. The gym had a lot of machines so I didnt have to wait for other people to finish.

"Ive stayed at the shangri la makati and find it to be better. This one looks run down desperately in need of an upgrade. A very tired look.

The staff seems pleasant enough, but overall the hotel was crowded and they did not seem to provide the high level of service Shangri La claims to offer.

The breakfast in the morning had a line going all the way around the outside and into the hallway. Perhaps because today is Sunday breakfast and non hotel guests are also coming, but the crowded feel didnt provide a great experience and the service throughout the breakfast was rushed.

The pool had a similar feel with just a large crowd over flowing.

I also noticed that my room was not cleaned until 2pm and had to request room cleaning. I also requested extra amenities to guest relations (10 bottles of the bath gel since theyre tiny to begin with and run out) the staff member told me that they can only provide 2 replacements. This is ludicrous since these amenities cost pennies on the peso and the hotel stocks millions of bottles. Every 4/5 star hotel I've stayed at usually doesn't bat an eye to such a simple request and usually provides a large assortment of amenities much greater than what was requested.

We enjoyed our stay here during our visit to the Philippines. The rooms are well appointed. The simplest rooms are like suites, in elegance, here in America. The fresh fruit plate, a welcome treat, was great! I loved the mangoes, wish they had more tropical fruits in there though. I would've appreciated the local choices rather than the usual orange and apple.

The concierge staff were always helpful, more accommodating than the front desk personnel.

Anyway, the pool was amazing! It is after all a Shangri La hotel. :)
The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was clean and had more than the usual toiletries, that you would normally have to request the front desk for, assuming they will have it.

Superb gym and leisure facilities and the Chi Spa whilst expensive by Manila standards, (though extremely reasonable compared to European equivalents), is fantastic. Difficult to find fault with the hotel, perhaps having a permanent taxi rank would be good as it can be difficult to get taxis in the morning or evening but this is common throughout Manila. I usually walk over to the Shangri-la mall and get a taxi from the rank there. For me, it is the only hotel I will stay in when in Manila.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"It has always been a memorable good experience every time I stay at EDSA Shangri-la. I've been here for staycations, conventions and even just date nights and each time is worth the experience. The hotel and service has been superb. The location is right in the middle of the city, accessible by various modes of transportation, just be patient with the traffic around the area. It has its own classy appeal. The lobby is most welcoming, the rooms are big and neat. The beds are the best among all the hotels that I've been to, it is very comfortable and well maintained. The restrooms are clean. The room service is prompt and the staff are courteous. The restaurant ""HEAT"" is worth mentioning, they served really good and quality foods.The poolside is a nice hang-out spot. One setback is their parking, which is small to accomodate huge number of guests, but there are options for valet or parking in the mall beside the hotel. Overall, this can be the best hotel in Manila.. Keep it up!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
This certain Roving Security Guard named Delfonso is arrogant & disrespectful! He needs to be re-trained how to face hotel clients with superior 5 star customer service & not like as if he works for a cheap motel in ermita! To start? He needs to learn to smile- all clients deserve that! Especially if you're paying so much for a class 5 star hotel! Iam so dissapointed & ruined my entire day!

"My husband's birthday is on May 10, the following day is Mother's Day so we decided to celebrate both occasions by checking in at Edsa Plaza Shangrilla. Our checked in was fine with a small line because we arrived at exactly 12 noon. Our room was the newly refurbished one at the 14th floor. It is beautiful, just the right size, bathroom is equally nice. Bed and linen pus pillows are of good quality. So, indeed it was a good start. Come 3 pm, we had our high tea at the lobby and it was fine, ambiance, food and staff were all good. My children had reservation at a restaurant, we then had dinner outside and came bak quite late and all was fine. Come morning, Sunday, Mother's Day, as early as 8:30am, there was a long queue, good that, I went down ahead of my husband that when he came down, we already had a table. The Heat was full to the brim, so many people waiting to be seated. After breakfast, we decided to go to the pool area, and whoa, people were in all available spaces! The pool was very crowded! So then it dawned on me that celebrating on a holiday is not a good idea. Check out time, we had to queue for almost 30 minutes, valet car retrieval another 30 minutes. Over all it was a good stay.. Staff were very helpful and polite especially the Manager of Heat Cafe who was very busy cleaning up tables!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

Everything was almost in place except for the hair dryer that I was not able to locate as it was inside the dresser table. Normally I find the hairdresser inside the bathroom!

"Being the workaholic person that I am, I often reward myself with a short ""staycation"" in the city to ""decompress"" some air of stress from my system. This time I opted to stay at Edsa Shangri-la for a short getaway from the hustle and bustle of Manila.

Ahhhh...bliss! I have found my own private oasis in the city. The hotel's slow WiFi connection has become a blessing in disguise as for a brief moment, I was transported to my very own cocoon of silence.

The room is quite nice but would have loved it more if the hotel made provisions for a marble bathtub and high pressure rain shower. Nonetheless, it was just alright as it served its purpose.

Truly enjoyed my night swim and lounging under the canopy of stars, palm trees, and tall buildings! Surreal....I can't seem to imagine that ""reality"" is literally a wall away. Amidst the splendid splash of water, I can hear the echo of the busy street (totally disrupted my Zen moment) beyond the safe confines of the hotel.

Thank you Edsa Shangri-la for giving me a piece of heaven amidst the harsh realities of urban living.

Next visit, hope to try the Chi Spa for more ""decompression.""",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"This review was based on personal experience in three hotels - traveling on business:
6 days in Edsa Shangrila, Mandaluyong City
3 days in The Penninsula
3 days in Mandarin Oriental

The best:
-Nothing beats service in Mandarin Oriental. If Edsa Shangrila and The Penninsula can beat them, you'll have no better reason to stay at Mandarin Oriental in Makati. Mandarin Oriental will go above and beyond such as tracking down your business shipment for you and email you when it arrives. Edsa Shangrila and the Penninsula will most likely gives you a concierge or more 'standard' treatment, not 'above and beyond' service like Mandarin Oriental.
-Nothing beats the grand orchestra of the Penninsula and the bedroom's pillow, bed, and sheet. Sleeping experience is best in Penninsula, more than Edsa Shangrila or Mandarin Oriental Club room. If you're jet-lagged, or light sleepers, I think you'll have no problem sleeping in the Penninsula. The Orchestra... it can personalize your music to your taste, such as English, Indonesian, Chinese melodies... simply splendid.
-Edsa Shangrila: Edsa Shangrila has no particular category that beats the other two hotels, but it is above average in all categories, which makes this hotel best overall balanced experience compared to Penninsula and Mandarin Oriental.

The bad:
Mandarin Oriental: As others note, the hotel itself is quite depressing. Old carpet, elevator, half of the club house is dark and unused, it's a little spooky. This is why it's balanced with the outstanding service, I think the people have learned a very important lessons - of ""knowing that they can or cannot control"". While the hospitality workers cannot influence the management for hotel upgrade/renovation for example, they make sure they beat everyone and every hotel in service... and it truly shows and deserves credits.
The Penninsula: While it's good for business setting, I wouldn't recommend it for pleasure. If you happen to work all-day, I think you want a distinction between work vs home. The Penninsula is less like home, more like office. If your real office is like the Penninsula, I think all the workers will have very positive work-health-index =)
Edsa-Shangrila: Can't really stay bad thing about this hotel, everything seems to be above average. If I have to name one, I think that because it's a good choice, it can feel a little crowded and less spacious... especially in the swimming pool or lobby area and around holidays... best if in the morning or evening before dark...then it's more serene.

Overall: Prices are about the same for all three hotels for standard rates, pick one based on what you value best. Is it the business? Penninsula. Is it the service? Mandarin. Is it the best overall? Edsa Shangrila.

BTW, there are two areas where all three hotels fail, though.
1) In all receipts, from meals, laundry, transportation bills, they always address me as ""Mr"" instead of ""Ms"". Maybe my name is boyish, but it seems that they all make false assumptions that I'm a male?
2) All three hotels can have more training in the idea of preserving environment, in the context of not replacing towels, bed sheets, etc, when guests choose so. In my experience, although used towels are hanged vs put on floor, they all replaces them. The same goes with bed sheets. In western hospitality world, the guests and employees understand this concept further, thanks to the management that makes it clear for guests in where/how to get replacement/re-uses, and all employees understand what they mean. I think in the eastern side of the world, it'll be good if the management can highlight that as well, so this concept and execution is well understood by both parties (guests vs workers). Thanks.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
the Shangri-La EDSA is smaller and a little less formal than the Shangri-La Makati. I like it here. The staff is very friendly and helpful.

"It was a pleasant stay overall. We were there to celebrate Mother's Day. We booked two rooms for our family. Check-in was fast. Staff were accommodating and always smiling. We were given Tower wing rooms but to my son's dismay, there was no bathtub in the bathroom of the newly renovated tower wing rooms. The couch in the room also needs reupholstering as you can already see the foam inside. The supposed to be complimentary bottled mineral water were placed inside the bathroom, thus we thought the Evian bottled water were the complimentary ones, which was later on charged to us at a ridiculously high price. We thought the room is smaller with the ones we usually occupy.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money

From charming General Manager to Horizon club servers down to the chefs and waiter/waitresses in the Heat restaurant, everyone is welcoming and greets you by name. The pool is newly renovated and excellent; the breakfast buffet at Heat is delicious; and the Chi Spa Hilot massage is highly recommended. Also, the convenient access to the Shang Mall and Cineplex is a plus!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

It is more casual than the business oriented Makati Shang (4.5 stars-their service & restaurants are unmatched) and you'll see more families here, especially on the weekends.

"There were many good things about staying at the Edsa Shangri-La including the delicious food at the breakfast buffet and the gym, sauna services.

The problems?
1) It was very loud during the day when I had to sleep (work the night shift). It would have been helpful if they had put me in the wing where it was less quiet.
2) The service at the buffet was not good. It was busy, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

In their favor, the team also made up for the fact there were many issues on my stay, so I will stay there again, most likely.",Food:Staff
"We have stayed at Edsa Shangrila quite a number of times being a member of Club Gourmet and Golden Circle which entitled us to use discount vouchers and freebies. The rooms at the tower wing had a complete facelift. Goodbye dark wood and old interiors. The rooms were brighter and as described by my son ""felt cozier than before"". We just stayed at the Garden Wing and we thought it needs a major make-over.

Service is exceptional as usual. The reason we love staying there on long weekends. We checked in during the Holy Week which was aptly described as ""national checkin day"" but the staff were in full force. Even if we lined up for an hour to get breakfast, the staff made sure they accommodated everyone.",Staff:Food:Cleanliness

"Since I've stayed in Shangrila Edsa hotel so many times and loved their service and rooms, I had very high expectations for Chi spa. We got a couples room, got a ying yang treatment and booked at 1030pm.

The interior itself was impressive but there were cleanliness issues that were just too many to let pass.

1. There was a used towel hanging behind the door
2. The sauna was filled with a muddy colored scrub ( probably from the previous guest)
3. The shower stank of mold and was already wet.
4. The room overall felt unclean, dated and not luxurious at all
5. The hair dryer was not working!

To top it all off, we had to wait 20 mins to get out of the spa parking since the guard on duty was nowhere to be found.

The massage was so so and not worth the hassle.

Our experience was very disappointing and for the price we paid we walked out disgusted and angry. I will never go back to Chi in Shang. Sad to say, I had a much better experience with The Spa villas in the fort. Chi cannot be called a luxury spa at all.",Cleanliness:Value for money

I saw someone on their hands and knees spot cleaning the carpet on my way to my room today. The rooms are very spacious. Most of the outlets are universal and suited for electronics no matter what part of the world you're coming from. The curtains, when drawn, block out every ounce of sunlight durning the day. A fresh apple, banana, and 2 water bottles are left each day. The gym is a complete facility filled with free weights, machines, and cardio. There's even a dance room in the back. Dumbbells range from 5 - 100 lbs. The pool is fantastic as well.

"My wife and I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-la for one night during the holy week - specifically Friday to Saturday. We chose it because we wanted to experience Shangri-la's reputation for service and luxury. Apparently though, the hotel is really full during the Holy week. Holy Week and Christmas are probably the two biggest and longest holidays in the Philippines.

Because of the sheer number of people who stay at Edsa Shangri-la during the Holy Week, it took us about 30 minutes to simply enter the premises of the hotel. Two lines trying to get in snaked around Megamall and Shangri-la Mall. Once at the parking area, the attendant, who was oblivious to the massive line-up happening outside the hotel informed us the parking lot was full. He told us to go out of the premises and go back in because they weren't letting cars in the basement parking. Fat chance that was happening and I told him I wasn't going to line up again for another 30 minutes to go in. Since I didn't budge, eventually he had to let me in the parking once he realized the massive line up happening outside.

Inside the parking, it took us another 30 minutes to line up and find a parking spot. It was pretty crazy in there. I've been to events before at this hotel but when I never realized until then how small the parking lot actually was. People were double parking everywhere and it was only by the grace of God that we were able to find a spot.

At check-in there was obviously a very long line. We probably waited for another 30 minutes just to check in. However, upon confirming our booking with reception, they informed us that the room was not ready. This was around 4:00 pm, 2 hours after the standard check in time.

To be fair, they made amends by offering us welcome drinks. First they tried to place us in the lobby cafe but that was packed so they placed us in the Heat restaurant and offered us some snacks of our choice while we waited. An hour and a half later, the receptionist finally comes by and hands us our room keys. To make further amends, they upgraded our room (most probably they ran out of our room type) and gave us a late checkout the next day. Fair amends but you don't expect these things to happen at an upscale hotel, at any time. I don't think this happens on a regular basis at this hotel but it mostly likely happened because the staff were unable to handle the sheer number of visitors.

The room we stayed at was in the newly renovated tower wing. It was spacious and very clean as well as having a lot of modern fixtures. I appreciated the design of the room as it was very light and brightly lit, unlike old upscale hotel rooms that are mostly dark with dim lights. The bathroom was clean. For a newly renovated room though, the design of the bathroom looked kind of old and out of place with the rest of the room.

The pool on the day we arrived was packed, we didn't feel like getting in because of the number of people. It looks like the pool was upgraded and now features a lot of stuff kids would enjoy and play with like water guns and a water slide (not yet operational when we were there).

Overall, our stay was good. But for the price, there's a lot of other better hotels in the area to stay at especially during Holy week. You won't go wrong if you book here, but avoid this place when it's a big local holiday.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

"Positives - New pool area is great though understandably crowded on Easter weekend, lifeguards and bar staff were on the ball and very attentive despite the crowd, New rooms are nice and are of the expected Shang Ri La standard, Jun of the concierge desk went the extra mile to help us on arrival.

The Bad - Upon arrival no bell hop, no valet, security ""ordered"" us to proceed to B2 to park our car or find a valet there (definitely not the Shang Ri La hospitality). At B2, obviously harassed and tired valet was rude, security guard with him was no better, thankfully Jun from the Concierge Desk was down there helping another guest so he assisted me with our luggage and check in, As expected BFast the next morning was a long line but again its a busy weekend so we understand, however if you start getting treated like cattle and asked to make compromises (have breakfast in a hallway) you should none the less still expect to be treated as a valued guest - rude wait staff, rude cooks and food that was not the usual Shang Ri La quality just made this Easter breakfast a nightmare - to salvage our experience, I took my family to breakfast across at the mall.

While we understand that this was going to be a packed weekend, we did not expect the hotel to seem to be this un prepared - half the staff were genuinely trying their best to make it better for everyone else - while the security, valet, wait staff at breakfast cant be bothered by the notion of service.

If you want the Shang experience avoid the EDSA Shang Ri La during peak local holidays. Lesson learned.",Staff:Food

"Renovations seem to be almost over and I had none of the issues that I had with my previous trip (noise, smell etc). Staff is extremely helpful and friendly and the atmosphere in the Hotel is great. The new addition to the pool are works great and I liked the refreshed look of the lobby lounge. I was in a new room in the tower wing with a big walk in shower. There seem to be two different room layouts - one with a glass desk in a corner facing into the room and old layout with the desk against the wall facing the wall. I prefer the glass desk in the corner. If you are a frequent visitor, the horizon lounge for breakfast will remove the annoyance you face in a very very busy breakfast area (with all the issues I noted earlier)
One thing re renovations: These might still be teething problems, but new is not always better and I think there was a compromise made on quality. Fittings in my bathroom where crooked. The sign that shows the room number outside the door - all of them on my floor were crooked. Some of the new fittings are not of great quality. The handrail in the shower had a loose cover, the pole for pulling the curtain had fallen off on day two and was never replaced fixed. Especially in the lifts the move to modern rather than quality is most visible - a solid brass handrail was replaced with a painted / plastic covered wooden one that rattly and not fitting well.
Small things I agree and all can be sorted, but this is a 5 star hotel - hence my rating of very good only for what could be excellent.",Comfort & Facilities

We had a view of the city and was quite striking during the evening. The location is convenient to the shopping malls and restaurants.

The health club was filled with all types of enjoyable activities and we took advantage of the steam room, sauna, hot tub and gym. The renovated swimming pool and area reflected a tropical paradise.

Our favorite stateside coffee houses were a stone's throw away from the hotel...Coffee Bean and Starbucks!! Even a Jamba Juice made our stay a home away from home.

The powerful air conditioning provided a welcome relief from the heat and smog of the outdoors.

We ordered room service once during our stay, and it was fine, no issues. The best part of the location is the hotel is attached to a huge mall, so shopping was close by. The hotel staff was excellent in making sure any requests or questions we had were met or answered. There are several restaurants in the hotel and we only tried two: the Japanese sushi/hibachi place and the Italian restaurant.

A concerned staff, luxurious rooms and first class restaurants are what I expect from Shangri-la properties, but the Edsa Shang has ramped it up to a new level. My wife and were
actually sorry to leave.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I have stayed in this hotel many times. This is my first time to stay in the refurbished Tower Wing. I emailed them to make sure that I stayed out of the construction noise, and they followed thru. My check in was a breeze thanks to Vianny who gave me a wonderful room on the 17th floor. The new refurbished room was excellent with more space, better lighting and climate control. The bathroom now has two types one that has bathtub and the other with rain shower. Toilet is also much better. The bed are the still the same. Fantastic. In conclusion, the shangrila room are not the same as some of the best hotel rooms in the world that I have stayed in, where my first comment was WOW, but it is luxurious, comfortable, and fantastic staff for good deal.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Free wifi but really slow during big conferences.
Staff was very helpful especially when they saw me carrying large bags. Great breakfast! Yummy! Love the newly renovated room with the Assorted welcoming chocolates. Didn't like the shampoo, though. Otherwise, the bathroom and entire guestroom had more than enough amenities.
If it weren't for the noise from the ongoing renovation, the shang would have gotten a perfect score from me.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"This review has been very difficult to write. I've stayed at Shangri-La hotels before and there has never been a problem. If anything, they have delighted me each and every time until this time.

I stayed twice and must say that the new and refurbished facility is fabulous. I also stayed at the garden wing and that is not. It is not horrible or bug ridden. No, it is still a luxury hotel but when you are a luxury hotel, the bar is higher and the garden wing of the Edsa facility is not up to that bar. I know that they are planning to refurbish but the fact is that at my stay, it wasn't refurbished yet.

In addition, I've noticed a slight reduction in staff. I've stayed at both Edsa and Makati for the last 20 years and this time, the drop off in service personnel was noticeable. They usually have people at the elevators - not this time. They usually have 2 people opening the entrance and exit doors - not this time. They usually have 3 to 4 people working at the bar area but it was down to 2 and they could barely keep up with the demand.

The general facility is still gorgeous and the people are, as always, extremely friendly and helpful.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

It's accessible to any mode of transportation and the interesting places to visit also are quite easy to navigate . Their spa and gym facilties are excellent .",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"as always, edsa Shangri-La tries to be the best in everything. and they are .... from the pick up at the airport (our flight arrived at 2am local time) to the doorstep of the hotel, bellman welcoming and greeting and helping you with your luggage at wee hours of the morning, warm welcome smile from the front desk staff checking you in, prompt delivery of your luggage to your room, a welcome fruit plate in the room, all helped to ease you in comfortably in your room after a long flight, and jet lagged at that. breakfast buffet? tops! my daughter always ask about the great breakfast spread - so much to choose from! spoiled and pampered we are indeed. keep it up!",Staff:Food
"The Shangri-La is a wonderful hotel. Particularly if most of your hotel stays are in the U.S. or Europe, you will be astonished at the level of service and the warm welcome. I've stayed at the Shangri-La a number of times over the past 6 or 7 years and always enjoy it. Comfortable rooms, nice health club, all-around great service and the best breakfast buffet I've ever seen. But I'm feeling a bit of slippage on my most recent visit (after a few year hiatus). The large restaurant was, well, grimy. Just about all the seats food-stained. And a number of the restaurant and lounge staff seemed like they must be in their trainee stage. Jut not up to the high Shangri-La standards I'm used to. Still love ""The Shang"" but I hope their management is paying attention.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We were able to get a room at the tower wing at a discount of 50% from BDO credit cards. For the discounted price, it was worth it. Reservation over the phone was efficient. They were able to take note of the early check-in request we made. The request for higher floor was also noted. They even sent an email confirming/reminding us of our reservation a few days before the date.

The room that was assigned to us was newly renovated. It was nicely decorated. One thing though, only 1 shampoo, 1 conditioner, 1 lotion and 1 soap was prepared. I have to ask for additional toiletries, although they were given immediately after our request. Service was fast.

There were a lot of people in the swimming area. When I say a lot of people, I mean really a lot of people. The pools were crowded. The lounging area was crowded. We wanted to relax by the pool, and swim leisurely, but that we did not do. There was a group of teenage boys playing and shouting inside the swimming pool and we have to move aside, else be hit by the volleyball they are throwing to and fro. There were a lot groups too. I think the pool area is too small for the number of people using it. One person I have to commend is the pool attendant, Apple. She saw us trying to arrange the lounge chair and came running from 10 meters away to help us out. That's what I call being alert.

We had our buffet breakfast at Heat. The breakfast, being free, is ok. But if we were to pay for it in full, I don't think it's worth it. Food tastes so-so. They have a lot of choices, but the taste is nothing spectacular. There were a lot of diners taking their breakfast there and the waiter attending to us was literally running around to attend to the guests.

One positive thing in our stay is the location. Since food is expensive in the hotel, we went to the nearby mall to take our meals and desserts.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I stayed here on a business trip on January 2014 for 6 nights and was impressed with the entire experience.
Great location, beautifully decorated room & lobby, lots of great malls nearby, great city view beyond the window. The only con was the food, they were so-so, but not a big deal. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. And, can not say enough about the staff. They were all genuinely friendly and took time to see any needs I had.",Location:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Having stayed at the hotel many, many times over the last 15 years, was looking forward to my stay over Christmas just gone.
Having reserved a table, Christmas Eve, in the lobby Lounge for myself and extended family for evening drinks and snacks we were informed that there was no reservation. Eventually given a table for the 20 of us. Service was terrible and the food took 1 1/2 hours for all of our orders to arrive (we had cancelled 2 of the orders and they still came out). Complained and eventually total charge was removed from our bill.
Christmas morning breakfast was mayhem; hotel could not cope with the volume of customers; eventually shown to the executive lounge were the staff were overwhelmed and could not cope.
Boxing Day was no better, had to queue for over 1/2 an hour to get into main dining area for breakfast.
Worst experience that we have had at what we had previously considered to be a great place to stay.

"We stayed for a night as I was doing a guest DJ at a nightclub nearby however they were undergoing refurbishment on some of the floors. The noise could be heard in other rooms and on other floors, they did offer to move me but declined as had already unpacked and due to leave a few hrs later for my gig. I did tell them that they should have either warned us at time of booking or when i contacted them to arrange airport transfers.

The hotel however I have to say was very good, clean and tidy, the pool area was pleasant, the lunchtime offer in the restaurant was great value, fantastic choice of cuisines both western and asian.

I would stay there again, but making sure that they provide a room with NO disturbance from the works should they still be going on.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"There were some problems (only one elevator working, long queue at check-in and check-out, waiting time for the bell boy, WiFi not working, etc) that were mostly eventually addressed once we made it known to the front desk.

The hotel is recently renovated (still ongoing) and is much brighter and updated in the decor.

These are apparently very well utilised, evidenced by the downgraded cleanliness, noise from the air conditioning.",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness:Staff
My husband & I enjoyed our stay on the 14th floor in a horizon club room. Afternoon cocktails & nibbles is a lovely touch. The best part was the breakfast at heat.

"I booked our Valentine's celebration to surprise my husband and our baby daughter. We stayed overnight at the Horizon Club DeLuxe from Feb. 14 to Feb. 15, 2014. Our experience was great. The people of EDSA Shangri-La were very accommodating. Our room was spacious. The food at the Horizon Lounge and HEAT was Superb. There are different varieties to choose from. The pool attendant named ANNA was really friendly and accommodating too especially for the towels to use for our baby. We will definitely come back here to stay. We enjoyed alot. The Hotel has an easy access to Shangri-La Mall to and it is very convenient.

Just one suggestion, hopefully they will have or they will install install bidet in the bathroom.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Decided to stay overnight in a Horizon Club Room after booking a Chi Spa treatment w/ my husband on Valentine's Day. Room was clean and fairly comfortable, although the bathroom was quite dated and in need of refurbishment. Toiletries provided were not complete (no shampoo, conditioner, or body wash).

Service, except for In-Room Dining and at the Horizon Lounge, was very hurried. They did not have enough people to attend to their guests at 90% occupancy. Restaurants also had no other offerings, except very restrictive set menus (set A or B). They could not accommodate any requests from their usual menu, even if these were to be ordered on top of the set menus. In-Room Dining service was excellent, but the food was not. Clam chowder was very watered down and food was bland.

We were informed that the Garden Wing will be renovated within the year and, hopefully, the lapse in service is just due to the big Valentine's crowd. There were some good points, such as the free teddy bear, rose, and chocolates waiting for us in the room and the efficient turn-down service. Guest relations were also fantastic prior to check-in, as we were given a discounted rate on their own initiative, even if we originally booked a higher rate online.

Still, this stay does not measure up to our infinitely better experience 5 years ago. Will still give it another try some time, but will definitely avoid staying there during holidays.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I only see this hotel in television before. Most of the celebrities hold their debu, weddings and othe special occassions into this hotel and there's nothing I can do but to admire its grandeur on the tv screens. When I started my review in Manila, I was so overwheled the first time I saw it from a distance and I promised to myself that one day I will be able to stay in this hotel.

Finally I got the chance to experience it last January together with my husband. Normally, after a long trip from Africa, we stay first in Manila for overnight before going to Davao. We did the reservation in their lounge at NAIA 1. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. We took a taxi going to the hotel. It was my long time dream so I was very excited. We had a hassle free registration and the desk officer understood very well that I came from a very long travel so she made all the important things we need to know summarized as short as possible. She was even kind enough to offer me to credit points to my emirates skyward since emirates airline is one of their partner airlines.

We had a nice cozy room. I love the wood works and interior design. The room was not as big as the other 5 star hotels that we had tried but it was amazingly comfortable and beautiful. It is connected in Shangri La mall so it is very convenient for shopping activities. There are plenty restaurants for hungry and hang out bars for party people outside the hotel. We had a complimentary breakfast at the Heat restaurant and the food were superb! I love the fruit counter and enjoyed the exotic fresh fruits combinations that they offered to me. Surely I will come back to this place.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Staying at Edsa Shang is always a pleasure. Once inside, I always feel like I'm detached from the urban jungle outside. The newly renovated rooms are beautiful, donning a much lighter color scheme that's easier on the eyes. The pool is one of the best in the Metro and is always a good place to unwind and relax. The service is always topnotch. Genuine smiles abound. The breakfast spread at Heat never disappoints. It practically has everything you could ask for. Overall, a wonderful experience that doesn't disappoint!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I luckily did not pay full price for this hotel as I would be more upset about it. It's not a bad hotel by any means but it is not worth the cost for what is considered a 5 star hotel. They are in the middle of refurbishing so the first room I was in, while beautiful, had a really really strong paint smell. I had to ask them to move me as it was giving me headaches and the hotel accommodated. The new rooms really are beautiful and the beds are very comfortable. I love the rain shower head and the pressure is really good. Unfortunately, every time I showered, there would be a puddle of water outside the shower as the door was not properly sealed. I did not tell management as my stay was short (3 days) or else I'm sure they would have fixed.

Customer service was good and everyone is very attentive. Perhaps too much? The breakfast buffet was included in my stay and for a hotel of this caliber, it was disappointing. It was ok. Same goes for the dinner buffet. While the range was large, I found better selections and better tasting food for both meals at the Crown Plaza at Ortigas Center and at the Radisson Blu in Cebu. The eggs & omelets were runny. Please cook these longer.

The pool was nice. The location next to the Shangri-La mall was nice. Location to everywhere else it moot as you're going need a car or driver anyway. Overpriced otherwise a nice stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"My partner and I stayed two nights at the Edsa Shangri La in January 2014. After all the hype surrounding this hotel, we were expecting it to be a true 5-star experience. However, we found this hotel to be all flash with little bang for your buck.

The Edsa Shangri La was the final stop on our 7-day tour. We rolled in from the Manila airport on a big bus and hotel staff politely ushered our group through to the lower level for a reception and check in. At first blush, things seemed great - they even had complimentary tea and tiny sandwiches as well as free 5-minute shoulder massages. These niceties were greatly appreciated by our exhausted, road-weary group members. But we quickly learned that hotel staff had done no preparation for our check-in and were calling us forward one-by-one to input our information into the hotel computer. It took 2 hours for everyone in our group to check in! It was a complete gong show and several members of our group complained rather loudly to the hotel staff.

The Edsa Shangri La is currently undergoing construction. We were unluckily assigned to the 9th floor, which was besieged by loud jackhammering between the hours of 9 and 5. Forget about that much needed afternoon nap.

Besides the noise, the room was quite comfortable and befitting of a 5-star hotel. The linens were of a high quality and the mattress was excellent. There was even a pillow menu of 7 options. Despite these luxuries, there were several little things that didn't make the grade. The telephone in our room didn't work. It was fixed when we mentioned it to the front desk, but a few hours later it was dysfunctional again. The toilet paper was single-ply (perhaps this is a petty thing to complain about, but I expect a hotel of this calibre to spring for the premium stuff). Our complimentary drinking water and hand towels were not replenished the second day. The free wifi suffered from extended brownouts. Call me crazy, but I expected much more from the Edsa Shangri La.

It felt like we were being squeezed everywhere we turned, and on several occasions we were even misled to believe something was free when it actually wasn't. For example, we were lounging by the pool one afternoon and my partner went up to the hotel bar to get a drink. He asked for a bottle of water and was given one. He asked if there was a charge, and the waiter waived him off. My partner understood that it was therefore complimentary. Two minutes after he returned to his lounger, another waiter came to him to inform him that his small bottle of water cost 194 pesos! That's about 5 Canadian dollars for a small bottle of water! Absolutely ridiculous! When you spend $200+ per night on a room where you can't drink the tap water, the least your 5-star hotel can do is throw in a few free bottles of water, or at least charge a reasonable price for it.

Let's talk about the breakfast. It was included with our room charge. Here again, it was about flash rather than substance. First, there was a 10 minute line up to even get a table! When you first walk around, the breakfast on offer seems great - there is a plethora of choices - you can have cereal, sushi, Indian food, 5 different kinds of fresh fruit juices, veggie shooters, crepes, waffles, pancakes, eggs made to order, plus all the other things a breakfast buffet should have. There are so many staff running around they are tripping over each other and the customers. With so many hands on deck, it baffles me how the ketchup bowl isn't always full, there are no pancakes or waffles for an hour and why the line up for eggs is a 10 minute wait?

The pool and gym area are definitely 5 star. Spa services are way overpriced as can be expected.

My final advice is this: save your money and book elsewhere. This 5-star hotel doesn't deliver the 5-star experience.",Value for money:Food:Staff

"Staying 3 nights in Jan at the Tower Wing Deluxe Suite; my observations;

- Very large, comfortable, well thought through room for furniture and amenities
- City view is worth a cup of tea watching over the city lights
- Service seems faster than the regular tower rooms. A distinct difference. Room service is near immediate for tea/coffee/drinks and faster for food than regular rooms (circa 45min or more). Must be dedicated or priority service for these rooms
- Filipinos are wonderful for service and a combination of Shangri-la and their hospitality makes a wonderful stay

The only difference to Shangri-la Singapore, Malaysia properties, in relation to service, is the proactiveness. In EDSA and Manila properties, you do need to ask specific questions in order to find the best answer for you.

"I am just finishing up a 4-night stay here, and my experience has oscillated repeatedly between 1 and 5 stars. The check-in was smoothly done in-room, but the corridors smelled of fresh paint and the next morning loud construction noise began at 9 AM. They told me the drilling would last till 6 PM every day. The view from my filthy window was a construction zone. One star.

They switched me to a quiet room on the 17th floor. After a meeting in the late evening, I stumbled into Paparazzi, their Italian restaurant, looking for perhaps a pizza and a glass of wine. No pizza on the menu, but what I had was superb - lobster bisque and beef short rib, with attentive service, good wines by the glass, and a relaxing atmosphere. Five stars.

The next evening I tried Senju, their Japanese restaurant. They were out of most of what I selected from their menu, simple things like edamame, toro, and green tea ice cream. The service was sporadic to non-existent. The sashimi was out-of-date and the fish that tasted the freshest, the salmon, was flown in weekly from Norway, according to the guy preparing the sushi. But he was interesting to talk with, so perhaps 2 stars here instead of one.

Disillusioned, I stopped at the lounge in the lobby for a drink. A young woman was singing old jazz standards, accompanied by a pianist. They were good. I had a glass of wine, relaxed, and award them 5 stars.

I had a massage at Chi, their spa, and have to give it 5 stars too.

Breakfast is vast and comprehensive, with Japanese, Filipino, European, American, and Indian cuisines all represented. The hot foods under heat lamps tend to be lukewarm at best. Overall, somewhere between one and 5 stars, depending on what you chose.

In summary, for the price this is a good choice, but it is not consistently a Shangri-la.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I have been in this hotel a few times in the last couple of years.
The Hotel is ok, the price ok, but thats about it. There are a lot of details that have room for improvement.
the food is allright but nothing to write home about. The Heat (restaurant and breakfast, is quite noisy, elevator music and freezing AC.
The Check in was quite a hassle (also due to the rescheduling from my side i admit, but there was no flexibility or understanding from the staff.
The Main point however are the ONGOING RENOVATIONS, which are indeed noisy from 9am-about 6pm.
I was in a renovated executive room, and it did SMELL renovated. a very very strong smell of new plastic or glue that left one a with a headache after a while. Really big disadvantage.
then there are details, such as one hour wait for dinner in room service and not at all clean room. handles and things in the bathroom, white stains on the headrest of the bed (no need to know the origins of those!) very big but completely DIRTY windows, the shower overruns when showering and therefore floods the whole bathroom through the space under the glassdoor, the shelves are extremely dusty...

We booked a total of 4 rooms,and between us, 2 of those rooms at the tower Wing encountered bathroom problems, the least of which were flooded floors and foul toilet odors. And the rooms they got transferred to had them as well. Our premier room was excellent, though. So ask for that if you want a smooth stay.

Fish and Chips had so much of oil and the chips were more soft than crispy. Breakfast option had a wide variety, but the coffee they served was not impressive.

Room was at the 12th floor garden wing, and they need a renovation asap. looks, feels and smells old already. Room was approx 20 plus sqms. I do not recommend you stay here, book the chi spa rooms on the 5th floor, now those are up to par with solaire's rooms.

Location of the hotel is still one of the best in manila as you're near ortigas business center, lots of malls that are walking distance, and near the posh villages of the city, plenty of taxis and near the mtr for you tourists.

swimming pool didn't improve nor degrade, it was the same like how i remembered 2 years ago (my last stay) though pool can be packed as lots of kids swimming. food and drinks by the pool were over priced as well, for a couple of drinks and pizza, our bill was double that of our in room dining in solaire, which was more filling and satisfying.

had a few desserts at the lobby lounge, and it was terrible. the singer there was eye candy, however her singing was similar to the dessert they served...
