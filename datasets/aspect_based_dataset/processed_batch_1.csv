"We stayed for a week and could not fault it at all, our room was perfect with an amazing sea view, it was clean and well presented. The daybeds on the terrace don't move but in the end that worked out just fine. The staff from start to finish were polite, helpful and attentive. The restaurants was fantastic. We could not have asked for a nicer stay and were sad to be leaving. Would highly recommend this hotel.",Staff:Location
"This resort is beautiful. The rooms are fabulous. The grounds are beautiful. The sea is crystal clear. The beach is clean and lovely. The pick up from the airport and speedboat transfer is well organised. The staff are warm and friendly. The food is delicious. It really has everything. So the comments I make following are small ones. We certainly hope to visit this resort again. And it’s definitely worth making the rather long trip navigating domestic and international terminals in Manila.

The breakfast is so busy. It’s noisy and huge. At all other times you would wonder where all these people are because the resort has so much space that you never feel it’s too busy at any other time. I really think there is an easy solution to this. There are lots of restaurants in this hotel and it would be nice to see a limited breakfast selection in a ‘no children’ breakfast setting in one of these other restaurants. Failing that, when we visit again we would probably book without breakfast and have in-room dining.

It would be nice if the hotel put a locally made beach bag in the room for use by guests while they are at the resort.

The check out time at the hotel is midday. We needed a very short extension on this to 1:30. Ultimately this was granted but it required several unpleasant phone calls for it to happen. It was such a short extension that it felt very petty and I personally feel it was entirely unnecessary.

As I said before, these are little things and more suggestions than issues and we very much look forward to visiting again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
i never fail to visit Shangrila Boracay eveytime Im having my vacation in Boracay. I always ate at their restaurant. Although a bit pricey but its worth it. The food is excellence the ambiance and the view of the resort is picture perfect plus the free shuttle they offered to and from the D' Mall.,Location:Food
"This is really a 4.5 star review. Had a chance to spend a few days there just a few weeks after Boracay reopened. The property is stunning. The villas are as good as you will find at any resort, the regular rooms have great views and quick beach and amenity access. Lobby and restaurants have great views as well. Service from getting you at the airport, the high speed boat taxi, to the greetings at the arrival doc or the lobby are top notch. I stayed in a villa and I could not have asked for more.

Almost all rooms will require some buggy transport due to the hilly layout. At times you may have to wait 5 minutes to get from you room by buggy but never when leaving the lobby. In general it works well; you can easily walk if you like, but it does get a bit warm.

Ate in some of the restaurants and the buffet master. The Italian One is stunning and has a good menu and the food was very good. The rest was just resort average and the poolside was slightly below that.

The resort has service staff that are on the better side of average for Shang properties. Even providing a cell phone for villa guests to have direct access to staff.

Now 2 important things you should know if you go before June 2109. First the island outside of the Shang is not ready after it was being renovated. The roads and infrastructure are well behind and make travel to/from the other town portions very difficult and slow. Loads of construction to go before it is ready. The stores are most,y upgraded but some are months away. It should be great in about 6 months. If you just want to stay on property, then don’t worry.

Second, there are limits to what you can do on property. There is only one place on site to get a drink after 9:30pm and it is an outdoor bar with seating for about 15. No dancing, no sports bar, so many who want some more appealing evening activities usually want to venture to town. Second, activities are limited to a few standup paddle boards, spa, pool, and snorkeling. If you want more you need to leave the resort and many motorized activities are now banned. I was okay not needing others, but compared to other all inclusive 4-5 stars it seems slightly less available.

Really glad I came. Had a great experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Transfers - On arrival at the airport we were met by the hotel staff, who made us feel very welcome. The transfer from the airport to Caticlan Port was comfortable. The Shangri-La have their own lounge at the Port, which provided snacks, cold drinks and cold towels. The port process was very smooth, and within 20/30 minutes we were on the Shangri-La speedboat, on our way to the resort. On arrival at the jetty we were once again warmly welcomed and taken to the hotel lobby area by golf buggy for check-in.

Accommodation - We had booked 7 nights in a deluxe sea view room, which was spectacular. The room was very spacious, beautifully decorated and had a wonderful view from the large balcony, which had a small table and 2 chairs as well as 2 comfortable beds to lie on. The bathroom toiletries were lovely, the bed was exceptionally comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. We were very thankful of an upgrade to a 2 bedroom pool villa for our last 2 nights, which was truly out of this world! Huge accommodation, private garden with infinity pool, and a personal butler to make any reservations and assist you - a real treat!

Restaurants / Bars - There are a number of Restaurants to choose from including a casual beach bar. All have plenty of different dishes and the food is of good quality. There are also 2 ‘fine dining’ options available should you wish to treat yourself, both excellent, particularly Rima, which is nestled in the tree tops and serves a Mediterranean menu.
We took advantage of the “cocktail happy hour” at the beech bar, where we discovered our favourite holiday cocktail the “Manila Sunshine”...

Staff & Service - One of the main reasons I love staying at Shangri-La hotels is the hospitality you receive throughout your stay. Every single member of staff always has a smile on their face when they greet you. At points, it felt like we were the only people staying in the hotel, due to the very personal and kind service we received at all times. I have never experienced this level of outstanding customer service in a hotel before, it felt very special.

"This was the first time I had traveled to the Philippines and I did it with a child and baby. First off, I want to warn you that traveling through the Philippines is more exhausting than one might imagine with a baby and young child, but I made it and we enjoyed ourselves.

Customer service was just ok, the room was nice and food was mediocre. I was disappointed by how difficult it was for me to book a nanny through the hotel and the children's play area was nothing impressive. The kids had fun and we have some beautiful pictures, but I don't see myself returning.",Staff:Food
"truly an amazing experience, it wasn't only the experience but also the ambiance of the said place was amazing, being at boracay wasn't enough we were provided with good service by the hotel and with that an amazing memory. thank you",Staff
"Super luxury resort away from the busy tourist strip. The service was fantastic and the amenities on offer are second to none. The restaurants are great, the pool area is super relaxing well maintained and you can choose from two private beaches in picture perfect bays.

There is a convenient shuttle service to bring you to the touristy centre which is well managed and very frequent.

You also do not have about how to get there or back to the airport. Picked up from the airport, driven to a welcome lounge, off to the resort with a private speed and escorted to your suite.

The only thing which was a bit of a let down was the attention to detail when our room was made up by Housekeeping. Repeatedly a bit careless and basic things were not replenished despite leaving a note asking for it...",Staff:Location:Food
"Amazing place for me and my family! We were some of the last few guests to have the pleasure to stay here before the Government decided to close down the whole island for 6 months. We had travelled from Hong Kong which required 2 planes via Manila so after all that we were looking forward to our stay at Shangri-la. Our room we originally booked (Loft villa) was not available when we arrived (due to over booking) and we were placed in one of the ground level 1 bedroom garden villas. I was a bit confused at first, as this was not explained to me prior to my arrival so would have liked some heads up. The garden villa was very dark due to being covered by trees and you could not see the ocean, so I was so glad when the following day, we were moved to the loft villa which was higher up so we could see the ocean views and it was so much nicer and lighter. The hotel grounds are amazing and the staff were very happy and professional at all times. I went scuba diving and my instructor was really cool and I had a great time looking at all the marine life. The kids loved the kids play area and just having the option to either use the main pools or our private pool back in the villa. The hotel arranged for our spa massages and a sunset catamaran trip which was awesome. Travel around the resort is by buggy as things are quite spread out especially if you're staying higher up. Used the gym each day and it was well equipped, with changing rooms and shower facilities. Food was really nice in all the restaurants we tried, though I would say sometimes at breakfast it got a bit hectic as the hotel was busy (best to arrive here before 8am). I think the best thing here was the staff and the amazing views of the ocean, it was really like paradise - the sunsets will take your breath away!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"This is my second time at shangrila and eagerly anticipated my visit.

I Was really disappointed with my stay.

First, upon reaching the airport Lounge and onto the resort shuttle, we felt like cattle. Squeezing everyone onto the bus.

Second, and I will disclaim this and say this is not the staff fault but just lack of initiative. All the staff were lovely, but there is seriously a lack in the staff getting things done. An example, we booked the treetop restaurant and we confirmed the morning off and they said the couldn’t find our reservation. Instead of fixing it up we went back and forth trying to figure out who we made the reservation with, who we talked too etc . This went on for 15-20 minutes. Such a waste of time. Also, on another night at around 8:30 pm we went to the concierge and asked if we could get a reservation at the seafood grill restaurant. She said without even checking that it was booked out?!? I asked her if she wanted to at least call and check... she did. Wow there was availability . We went to the restaurant and it was mostly empty?!?

We also tried to hire a private car... all gone. We can only wait for the shuttle- one hour wait .... no mention of asking a tricycle... we just wanted to eat. We had to hear from another guest that you can ask them to call you a tric ?!? Why did they not tell us this??

This place is not cheap and accordingly you except a level of service. This was not met and I left feeling very disappointed with my stay.",Staff:Food
"My husband and I were very much looking forward to staying here so you could just imagine how excited we were when we finally arrived. The hotel grounds and facilities are impressive. From the moment you arrive at the property, the wow factor is instant! The pools are fantastic and beaches are pristine. It's really a nice little paradise, away from the hustle and bustle of White beach.

However, we were pretty disappointed when we arrived in our room. We had the deluxe room which was just average. The room was a slightly dated and the native carpet / rug below the bed was weathered - the ends were in shreds. For 500 USD a night, you would have expected a room that was a little more kept and maintained.

Service was not consistent throughout our 5-night stay. Some days service was fantastic. Some staff were really making an effort to make our stay a good one, and that we appreciated. Other days, service was extremely slow. It took over half an hour for bath salt to be delivered to our room. In two occasions, they ran out of pool towels. It was only a 15-minutes wait but this shouldn't have happened in my opinion.

During check out, we were incorrectly billed over 200 USD - a bill which the spa has incorrectly charged us during our first stay. We thought we had already sorted this issue out on the first day but this again came back in our final bill. Mistakes like this shouldn't happen twice especially for this type of hotel calibre.

We were so looking forward to staying here and in many parts, we did have a good stay and enjoyed the hotel's facilities and beach. It's unfortunate though that it wasn't a perfect stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"Wonderful location, it is not in the stretch of over-crowded Station 1 to 3 of Boracay Island. It has its own cove and beach. We have stayed in Boracay more than a few times and this stay has been the best, so far.

The room has a great ocean view, very spacious with a wonderful bathroom and balcony. The bed and mattresses is very comfortable. It is such a relaxing feeling to wake up with the view of the ocean and you have been well-rested because of the quality of your bed and mattresses. It makes a difference and it gives a good reason why you choose to vacation in a good hotel.

It was a birthday weekend and the staff were very gracious enough to give us a birthday cake, balloons and a song. Very heartwarming, although we did not ask for it. The restaurant is equally wonderful as well. We had our dinner in their seafood restaurant and it was a relaxing experience altogether. You get a wonderful view of Boracay sunset while seating in your own cabana, very private and spacious table setting. Food is excellent, as usual.

The travel to Boracay island from the airport is very stressful already since you have to make a lot of transfers with your luggages and line up for the payment of environmental fees and permits as tourists. But that is where the difference lies with staying in Shangrila compared to other hotels. You dont line up—your vacation starts once you get off the plane. they pick you up from the airport, give you a good welcome, get your luggages, bring you to their welcome lobby at the pier which is very comfortable, by the way. give you a refreshing cucumber drink and hot towel and wait for your boat transfer— a speedboat. These added services, esp when it is just a short weekend vacation, would make you thankful that you paid extra as it is all worth the comfort and convenience.

Stayed in several exclusive hotels in Boracay, as well, with their own private boats and private welcome lobby at the port but Shangrila Boracay’s service top them all. Very commendable.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Arrived this week for my 3rd visit to this little edge of paradise in Boracay, Philippines. Whilst standards are not quite as high as 5 years ago, they have slipped only minor notches from what we first experienced and it will be a real shame this resort will close for 6 months soon. For anyone looking to experience a checkout from reality and a check in to a resort full of attentive staff, amazing views of paradise proportions and facilities to match any high grade hotel worldwide this place is worth the effort of getting to. A haven’t stayed anywhere better and just maybe the short term inconvenience imposed by the president will be worthwhile to preserve this island forever.",Location:Staff
"The resort is located in a wonderful area in the north of the island with white beach and huge pool, not very far to the famous station 2. This is a peaceful place, super good with families with kids. The hotel is well finished and the main building, the gardens, the pool and the beach are well managed and look very nice.
The room are clean and the service very good. They come 2 times a day to put in order the room and to prepare for the night. The room is full of towels and it is very nice, considering that sometimes it is necessary to make a couple of showers a day.
The resort is also offering a shuttle bus to connect you to the white beach in station 2.
But the most nice thing is to have the private Shangri-La boat to transfer from Caticlan directly to the resort, avoiding the crazy traffic on the unique road in Boracay.
This is the perfect and the best place to spend holiday in this beautiful island.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My favourite resort in Asia! It’s tucked away on the north west side of the island, away from the hustle and bustle of the Boracay night life. The rooms are big with everything you need.

"What an amazing resort, everything was amazing from food, customer service, pools etc. very relaxing, you have multiple pools to choose and 2 beach fronts although I kept going back to the open space beach where you can go for a long walk .

"This is a fantastic resort, hidden away to the North of Boracay Island, away from the over-crowded and polluted main beaches.

Great private beach, attentive staff, good restaurants and activities... there was little to fault our stay. The motorboat transfer to the mainland was a great touch too. Only downside was that the rooms (we had a tree-house) were beginning to show their age (windows needed a clean, lick of paint etc), and will need upgrading soon. But that was a minor point to an otherwise excellent stay.",Location:Staff

"Was collected from Kalibo Intl Airport in a private van, and was then taken to the Shangri-La Boat port; this journey was almost 2hrs long, so if you have children, have the iPads charged and ready! You then get a little boat over to the resort itself and the fun begins! We were welcomed and checked in very quickly, and then taken to our room. My only quibble is that the room was very outdated and and had no view what so ever. It was clean, and we had fresh fruit provided daily. We had a family room... of all the Shangri-La resorts I've stayed in (which has been several), Boracay had the smallest family rooms. For kids, there hotel is not lacking in entertainment and things to do. They have a kids soft play, and a club house with arcade games, pool tables and daily art and craft activities. We did the island hopping tour and snorkeling, which was very good and a nice day out. The hotel provides an hourly bus service into Beach Station 2, which was easy to access. They had a number of restaurants on site, including a Mediterranean/ Italian, seafood, International Buffet etc. The one thing that annoyed me was I found the restaurants to be very under staffed, making it difficult to order drinks etc. Overall, great stay and I would highly recommend!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
Stayed in one of their villas which was spectacular. We all loved it and will be back again soon. Food was good and villas were stunning. Amazing treatment at their spa which is so peaceful. We went there to get away from kids. Try this resort. They offer boat service from other side of island which was so convenient.,Food:Location:Staff
"This is truly a beautiful resort with a spectacular location, We stayed in a treetop villa for 5 nights in January. The spacious 2-story villa has a stunning view of the ocean and beach; we spent evenings sipping cocktails gazing at the picturesque sunset.

Also, we utilized their diving center for snorkeling and parasailing activities, which are staffed with very professionally people. The resort beaches are considered semi-private and very enjoyable during early morning hours but can be crowded later in the day.

The spa facilities are to die for. They have an extensive spa menu/program with very able ""professionals"" which we enjoyed very much. Oh yes, bring your swimming trunk to enjoy the very beautiful pool.

While we did not experience those negative situations as described by the previous guests, the major downside to our stay at this resort is the ""sad"" condition of furnishings in our tree-top villa, they are old and tired, used and abused.

The bath tub as well as spa tub (in the outside deck) are stained and cracked at certain spots; definitely posing health hazard to hotel guests. Our pull-out shower head in the bath tub has a torn cover, totally exposing the inner plastic tube.

Overall, the housekeeping staff did a superb job in maintaining the room in an orderly fashion. They managed to ""hide"" the torn tubing by carefully putting back the shower head back in place. Oh well...

We tried all their restaurants. (1) Vintana - where we had breakfast buffet and also dinner buffet, there is a wide variety of delicious food choices, our favourite restaurant, but we got sick after eating some cold dishes. (2) Sirena - which is a seafood centric upscale restaurant, very disappointed, should have ordered their grilled dishes instead. (3) Rima - their highest end culinary restaurant with a high end price. Just don't expect Michelin Star food and you'll not be disappointed. (4) Cielo - pool/beach side dining, we had the most tasty pizzas, very unforgettable!

No regrets paying up that hefty hotel bill afterwards! Will definitely stay there again!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We booked a sea view room 11 months in advance for our honeymoon which we made clear. On arrival in the evening we were shown to a room far away, It had no sea view, they said it’s partial sea view and I asked for another room and the woman said no. We were very ill, tired and had horrendous delays from our Manila layover. I was shocked there was ZERO mention of our honeymoon. The only hotel in 4 we stayed in that failed to acknowledge it. We did request again to move rooms and moved the following day. In our new room they left us wine, petals in a bubble bath and on the bed with origami towels. It felt like things were looking up, although both rooms felt dated and baths never looked clean! The weather was atrocious for 4 days but we tried our best to enjoy it despite also being ill. It was hard to get into their restaurants so we had to eat in the buffet restaurant a couple nights - be warned lots of kids running around. One day we came back at 4pm to our room and the cleaners were just walking in! We turned around and took a walk (in the rain) around the resort although we had already decided we wanted to be back in our room and not walking - inconvenient! The next day we left our room at 7am - the cleaner specifically asked which room we were. We thought that was because she couldn’t knock on doors so early, so would clean ours straight away rather than a repeat of the day before. We were up and down all day but nothing, eventually at 6pm we complained. We specifically said we were disappointed but didn’t want the to be disturbed (we were ill and just wanted to rest) a few moments later there is a knock at the door so we had to get out of bed to again explain we did not want the room turned down until we went to dinner. On arrival back there was a bubble bath and wine but we were leaving the next day and never drunk the wine because we were ill and red wine in a suitcase is never a good idea. We felt so disappointed on a few occasions - the Initial room, the lack of honeymoon acknowledgement and then the cleaning! Aside from this, the tea and coffee at breakfast took far too long. There were queues at breakfast. It all did not feel 5* Shangri La standard at all. Being ill and having bad weather you really do need that 5* service you pay a premium for. On the plus side the pool staff are great - we sat under the umbrella trying to make the most of the warmer climate despite the rain.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Great location and very friendly staff. Unfortunately the trip to Boracay starts with a horrible airport and in peak Seasons you have to queue up to 1,5 hours outside for immigration. The trip from airport to the resort is about 1,5 hours drive plus a 15 Minutes boat ride. During the boat ride you see the very touristy resorts and the beach and the water area is fully crowded. The resort itself is located at the tip of the island and is more private and secluded. The water is crystal clear and the private beach very scenic. However the sea in front of the beach is used by many noisy boats every minute and helicopters are flying above every 5 Minutes. We could not reserve any table in the Italian and Seafood restaurant because it was fully booked. The main restaurant was fully packed and not like a 5 star resort. It seems the hotel is specialised on Korean and Chinese guests. The whole area is simply overrun by too many people. Guess what they have opened another airport less than 5k away from the resort. All in all I feel it’s overpriced and not really high end. It’s really a pity because the location is fantastic but it can’t cater for the numbers of guest.
Be aware, prices for kids menu are too high and nearly everything is charged extra. The SUPs does not have a fin and can’t be used as SUP at all. The sports activity centre offer a wide variety. Just don’t go to the common platform where all water sport activities are starting from. It’s rather a fully overcrowded bus station with partly run down equipment. It feels like hundreds of guest are there. The jet ski area and parasailing area are strictly limited areas and far away from any individual excitement. If you look for some individual activities don’t go from there.

The staff however is very attentive and friendly. Please be aware that all my experience were during Chinese New Year weekend. The rather unpleasant arrival experience at the airport got worse leaving with longer queues and total chaos at immigration and check in. Not organised at all and for this experience airport fee is demanded. Families with young kids have been queuing outside for over an hour. The staff was selling water for 2US$ instead of 70 US Cent inside! Plan plenty of time for leaving and arriving.

"What a fun time with my family. We arrived Jan 1 to Jan 5. When we arrived it was raining really hard & the water was quite rough. The staff were quite calm & collected and gave us the information that due to the weather, we wil not be able to use the boat all the way to the resort, but ride the speed boat from the main land to the base of Boracay, then take a van all the way to the resort. The staff at the hotel gave us a very nice warm welcome & drinks while we got our check-in all sorted.

Getting to our room was quite pleasant & our girls (10 & 6) enjoyed the golf ride. Because of the boat, I got a bit sick and was not able to enjoy the rest of the evening with my family. I ordered room service & it came pretty quickly. Unfortunately, their congee (Lugaw for locals) didn’t have much of a taste. A bit disappointed, but ate half anyway. My husband didn’t enjoy his chicken wrap as well...again due to the taste, BUT when we did check-out they took that off our bill...thank you...great customer service there.

Getting back to the room, our first room was 409 & the toilet would continue to flow & thebathroom screen gets stuck and thus everyone can see you in the bathroom. The safe was not working & neither was the fridge. After our complaints of the condition of the room, they moved us next floor up with no hassle. It had a view of the ocean.

The buffet breakfast was quite extensive from local cuisine to Japanese. It was a shmorgasborg kind of breakfast. They even had a Donut wall which both my kids enjoyed immensely. LOL. As I am lactose intolerant, the staff tried their best to provide me with my latte in the morning with other milk alternative (coconut & almond milk).

We didn’t leave here to go into town at all during our stay, even though we thought we would. Everything is catered for in this resort, including a games and entertainment section for the whole family and a huge play area for younger kids.

There are several restaurants onsite and also a great room service menu. Their private beach is in front of the pool where we spent most of our days.

"This was our 6th stay over recent years and still an amazing hotel but when you are such a premium property you come with high expectations and the little things matter.
I don't get how after 6 stays here the management still aren't able to recognize a returning guest , no note in the room re 'welcome back' just the standard card from the manager welcoming us to the Shangri-La. Have made this comment in the past but little changed on this front. One of the supervisors made a comment that we should have let them know we were coming- come on guys , we booked under the same name and same GC number - you should know we are coming, a little upgrade on customer service needed. Other than that the wonderful breakfast buffet seems to have declined a little and was disappointing not to see any smoked salmon , ham off the bone, or dim sum offerings which have been standard in the past. Oh and now they have implemented a charge for children at the breakfast buffet which, when you are paying the prices to stay in a villa, is a little petty. Still love the place and still the best option in Boracay although we may try somewhere new next time around.",Staff:Value for money:Food

"This resort is an oasis of calm and luxury on a chaotic and busy island. No, I do not work for Shangri-La, haha.

We have been fortunate enough to visit some of the world’s most exclusive resorts — Kandolhu Maldives, Conrad Bora Bora, Raffles Dubai, Rayavadee Krabi, etc — and in terms of dollar value, the Shangri-La Boracay comes out on top.

The property is sensational, with 2 beautiful calm beaches (1 is truly pristine and perfect for swimming), a massive complex of infinity pools with lifeguards and bar service and beach cabanas, and a beach to mountain jungle feel with an amazing bar perched on the cliff side overlooking the beach (ideal at sunset).

The restaurants are great, especially the breakfast restaurant. The daily breakfast buffet (included for all guests) is the best I’ve been to anywhere in the world. There is a donut WALL.... yes a wall with every type of donut known to man, ready to take off the wall peg and consume, along with every other ethnicity’s breakfast cuisine cooked to order by chefs. Udon Japanese, weird Chinese, European, continental, etc.

The daily shuttle into town is extremely convenient and runs often by friendly drivers. White Beach is good fun but it would be less so if you had to stay there at night, but the Shangri-La is 25 mins drive away from that chaos and back to tranquility.

Our room was ok. It was a basic room but large, modern and had a balcony with a great jungle canopy / beach view. The last day there was a heavy paint thinner smell in our room from renovations nearby. We complained, management sent an apology letter and free bottle of wine and we survived our last night, and the smell was mostly gone by the next day. Good response to a fairly significant guest problem I felt.

Overall in my opinion you end up with one of the best resorts in SE Asia, and among the best value picks for _true_ 5-star resorts on the planet.

Highly recommended.

This review was for an 8-night stay in Jan 2017, 2 adults aged 29.",Food:Location
"The hotel is about a 20 minute drive from the famous White Beach is an isolated but beautiful location which is reached from the airport by the hotel's own motor launch.

We had a large suite which was very good indeed and included free soft drinks.

The hotel is situated on two stunning beaches and has a large pool area which did get crowded so we stayed largely on the beach.

The main drawback we found was the poor F&B offer. Firstly when we arrived we were told that the 2 signature restaurants were fully booked, one of them for the whole stay. You really should be told this before you arrive. Secondly, they was a queue to get into the breakfast room.

The breakfast itself was OK but they were constantly running out of items.

I think this would benefit from having a club like many other Shangri-La hotels to take pressure off the breakfast room.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Location: in Boracay island
Facility: a nice huge facility with two beautiful serviced beaches, a swimming pool, nice relaxing spa villas, various restaurants, a breakfast buffet, a nice gym, a tennis court, suvoneir shops, rooms and villas.
Check in: the experience starts from the shangri la’ private deck where the ferry takes you in a 10 min ride to the hotel’s which is in a separate island. Check in process was smooth and informative. I liked the refreshing welcoming drink.
Room: my room was a deluxe ocean view room. It has a small balcony and a spacious bathroom. Bed was comfortable. And closet room was good.
Conciege: Tobi was great, she helped us with all our restaurant and Spa reservations.
House keeping: good and maintained the room clean but they were not consistent.
Check out: it was very stressful as the hotel wasn’t organized enough to take us and some hotel residents to the airport in a timely manner due to windy weather. Thank God we didn’t miss our flight back.
Transportation: free from and to Caticlan airport transport, free transfer to and from the town before 9 pm, buggy transfer between hotel facilities.
Over all: a nice beautiful hotel resort with breath taking beaches. Most restaurants were generic except for the sea food one. I like their laundry service where they do your laundry and pack your after for a small amount of money. There are activities in the hotel where you don’t need to leave at all. If I were to go back to Boracay again i would be staying at the shangri la.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We have stayed at Shangri-la Boracay several times over the last 8-years or so, although prior to this trip, it had been a few years. We were pleased so see that the resort was as spectacular as we had remembered, and the pool villas continue to be our favorite.

The resort-boat pickup, beautiful pool, great restaurants, breakfast buffet, private beach, butler service, overall excellent staff, etc., make it difficult to leave at the end of our stay.

Shangri-la Boracay will continue to be at the top of our list of stops when we visit the Philippines.",Food:Staff
"If you expect high level of service, very good food and entertainment don't stay at Shangri la.
During Christmas holidays not enough staff and sunbeds, very poor activities for adults and kids.
The rooms are nice and the location is beautiful with a very nice pool, you can relax if you find a sunbed available which was not our case during our 6 nights stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"The main argument for Shangri-La Boracay is that it is one of the best options in terms of location (quiet and private beach) and best of service on Boracay. Boracay as a resort island is a train wreck, so better look somewhere else if you are looking for an idyllic beach island paradise with swimmable water. The best way to describe Shangri-La now is the best of a bad bunch of options.

The privacy side is negated by the fact that this resort seems to have turned into a children's fun park, and any consideration for guests without children is thrown out the window. Some examples:

1. Constant noise in the passageways outside the rooms with children playing and no one, neither parents nor Shangri-La staff concerned about reducing the noise. Parents seemed relieved the children are not actually in the rooms with them. Impossible fo us to sleep in.

2. Pool gets over run with children, there is no separate pool for families with children.

3. Restaurant Rima: we were surrounded by tables with children. We paid P25k for a dinner for four and I had to ask the guests at the next table to have their children put their iPads playing various games on silent. One of the parents father's seemed very annoyed by this, as it was providing a distraction for his children that he had no interest in interacting with. I was annoyed because I was the one to ask that they mute the devices. Why can't the restaurant team do this??

4. My wife and I were almost hit by rocks thrown from the fifth floor passageway to the ground floor. I tracked the children down and took them back their parents who were oblivious and happily hanging out in their rooms. Again no Shangri-La staff anywhere to stop what could have been a very serious accident.

The food is ok but no great. I have had many better resort food experiences.

The rooms are getting very tired, and in need of renovation.

Management seems to have left the building, during our five day stay we did not encounter the resort manager or assistant manager at all. Maybe they were all on holiday a decent resort somewhere else, which is maybe why the resort was having so many issues.

Overall a very disappointing experience from Shangri-La. I am fully expecting a smart response from the team at Shang along the lines of their assistance when we stayed there. When we complained about the constant noise and nuisance from children their suggestion was we get a private villa for US$2k/night, very helpful if you never want to leave your room, even for dining.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"The Boracay Shangri-La does not disappoint. We’ve stayed at a number of Shangri-La hotels throughout Asia and this one lives up to the level of service and quality expected. The rooms are definitely a strength relative to some other Shangri-Las. We stayed in a deluxe sea view room and villa. Both rooms were spacious and SUPER clean. LOVE the glass bottled water and refillable ceramic dispensers for toiletries. First hotel I’ve been to that is starting to be environmentally conscious.

The semi-private beach is quieter than the private beach. The pool and private beach areas were always crowded. the snorkeling right off both beaches are pretty good. The activity center has activities for all ages and kept my kids occupied for hours.

The only weakness- relative to an excellent stay—, although still very good, were the restaurants. We ate at Sirena, Vintana Cafe (Main breakfast, lunch, dinner restaurant) and poolside. Service was good and selection very good. Quality was good but not excellent across the board.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Service was superb from the time you get to the airport.They offer a shuttle service, a lounge and speedboat would take you the resort in less than 10 mins.

"We spent 7 nights at the Shangri-la Resort Boracay Island in the Philippines in October this year (2017) and we can honestly say it has to be the best hotel we have ever stayed in. ( we have stayed at many great hotels including Ritz Carlton,Singapore, Raffels, Cambodia, New York Plaza, Four Seasons, Florida)
From the moment we were greeted at the airport we knew we were in for a fabulous experience. The customer service from all the staff is exceptional. They are all genuinely caring, professional, knowledgable and above all put their quests first. This is a credit to Anne, the resorts General Manager and her great team. Anne and all her team are a first class credit to the Shangri-la brand.
The food was outstanding. My partner is Vegan and the hotel catered superbly for his diestry requirements. (We did email in advance just to inform the hotel) There is a great selection of places to eat and drink. The resort oozes luxury and tranquility. One night we sat enjoying a meal on the beach by the pool bat and a turtle came into the beach which was amazing. Breakfast was an absolute delight. Fantastic choice. A big thank you to all the catering team.
The resort offers a free shuttle service onto the resorts town, which is worth a visit.
The rooms were fantastic and impeccable clean. The room service team took pride in their work. We loved the little gifts of towel sculpted left on the bed and fresh flower petals in the bath that had been made for us. Amazing.
The dive centre is a must if you are into scuba diving or want to lear. The dive masters, Callum and Steven and all the dive centre staff were brilliant. Very friendly and created a great atmosphere. My partner who is an open water diver completed his advanced open water and nitrox courses here and says it was the best dive centre he had been to.
So, would we stay here again. Without a doubt. Thank you to Anne and everyone at the Shangri-La, Boracay Philippines.
I can sum up the Shangri-la in two words “PARADISE FOUND”",Staff:Food
"Offers a Private beach away from the hustle and bustle. Superb Customer service right from when you arrive when you are greeted by a dedicated person to help you check into the resort. Speed boat from Catlican to resort was convenient and well organized. Wi fi available throughout the resort, including on the beach. Grounds are well maintained. Buffet breakfast is all foodie’s bliss- you won’t leave hungry. Make sure you order the pina colada, your trip won’t be complete with out it.",Food:Location
"Despite my first review being deleted I am happy to post it once again with some adjustments....

Now with all these positive reviews it might be hard to find sth faulty wih this place. . We are currently staying at shangri la boracay

First the positives:
- Mostly friendly and engaging staff with the occasional exception. Our butlers are excellent, staff on the beach extremely attentive.
- Breakfast top notch
- the private beach and gardens are beautiful and never overcrowded so is the water 
- the restaurant food is ok though overpriced for what you get 
- the villas are spacious and though the resort is currently 90 percent occupied it does not feel full at all

The negatives and I don't know why this has not been highlighted earlier:

- Boracay is a cheap mass tourism destination for Koreans, Taiwanese and Chinese and it has an impact on nearby (once) beautiful puka beach, which is now becoming a destination in itself. During daytime you have every 2-3 minute large boats with tourist crowd passing by the Shangri la beach with noisy and stinking engines going to puka beach.It is constant noise, especially on Bunyagan Beach (puka beach is just to the right of Bunyagan beach behind the rock formations)
Not the fault of the Shang but it's a drawback.

- The guests: I rarely say this but the sophistication of a lot of people (not everyone obviously!!) staying at this place is below average for a place like this. There is no ""quality"" audience matching the price levels, instead people going to fine dining restaurants in t shirts and shorts. We have previously experienced loud talking at dinner , screaming at the pool, people drinking pints in large groups in the pool, people taking a swim in full clothes in the pool (think about hygiene ..this is a ""thing"" with many Asians nationalities to protect against sun.) , people listening to their jukebox on the beach , in other parts of Asia, just not used to it in this kind of setting, which is highly exclusive
. I hope I put it nicely enough so that my review is not deleted once again....it's not the fault of the resort that these people have the money to book such as place, but they are there , so it should be fair to have these comments included for people who do care who is frequenting such a hotel...you might be used to a different audience from Europe or the US.

- the resort is used. We pay more than 750usd a night for our villa . But the furniture looks very used so is the veranda. Renovation should be done shortly hopefully.

This is without any doubt the best place in Boracay with the best location and it's my 4th time on the island. Have seen many hotels in the meantime since 2006 when I first came here. Boracay itself meanwhile is destroyed each year more and more by the cheapest mass tourism I have ever seen so just don't explore if you don't want to be in for a disappointment .... like in many parts of Asia there is just no masterplan but short term profit maximisation as a focus. t's not the fault of Shang which is an evironmentally friendly place with their own bottled water and bat nesting places . The resort is beautiful, but there are a few drawbacks . For a few days worth it but don't venture to White Beach at all cost. You will be in for a shock.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

As someone who enjoys an occasional cigarette with a drink, it was incredibly frustrating to not have a single bar with a small area to smoke. I’m not a fan of an all smoking hotel. On the contrary. But we do enjoy a cigarette with a beer.

We slept well and the room was a large enough for us. It's called the family room.

The food was very food at the pool side bar and at the seafood restaurant. The burger was good and the carbonara pasta was also very good.

I also used the spa. The massage service was also very good. I was very happy with the spa and the quality of my massage.

"We booked a Loft villa with the private pool and didn’t regret it. First of all, the whole resort is amazing. The view, the beach, the employees — everything was in such a good condition and well thought through. The villa was really spacious and well designed. Our favorite spot for sure was our own private infinity pool - we will probably never forget the amazing sunset view. When you book a Loft Villa it also includes your private butler and a shuttle service, which makes your holiday life even more enjoyable and easier. Also the breakfast buffet was awesome and huge; it literally offered everything you could think of.

Unfortunately, there was a problem with our air conditioning and a large amount of water poured from our ceiling out of a sudden. A plumber was sent immediately and tried to fix the issue. Nevertheless, after an hour the same problem occurred and we had to call for the plumber again. The hotel did solve the problem after the second time but didn’t apologize or offer any compensation for the inconvenience.
We totally understand that something like that could happen anywhere, but if you stay in a 5-star resort and pay that price/night for your own private retreat you would at least expect an apology for the trouble caused (they had to work in our villa for at least 1,5hours while we were there).

Besides that problem everything was great and we recommend staying at Shangri La to everyone!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

Anything from the landscaping, the design of the villas and rooms, amazing breakfast buffet. Worth considering for a beach stay in the Philippines in a large scale resort. And that's the catch. If you want lonely beach go to Palawan. It is a large resort. That is not good or bad. You just need to know if you want that. If you do you get all the bells and whistles.

"We stayed in a suite, with direct access to the beach. With three adults and one toddler, the room was comfortable and spacious with a separate bar/kitchen area. I like the unlimited amount of bottled water in our room and also the butler on call. The rooms do not scream luxury, but they are decent. The bathrooms and rooms are showing signs of wear and tear --I imagine with the humidity it is difficult to maintain the rooms to luxury standards. Service is not super, but you know they are trying hard which makes it pleasant. I really appreciated that the beach attendant tried to help me obtain sunblock after running back and forth between the beach and the shop. Golf carts to drive you around the resort may take some time at night.

The breakfast buffet was quite good, with an array of many different types of cuisine. The other restaurants were average, and even the Italian restaurant with its amazing treetop ambience was just mediocre.

We took the free shuttle into town, but don’t leave the resort unless you need a reminder of how awesome the resort is.

"We had a fantastic stay at the Shangri-La Boracay Resort over the long weekend in October.

Our overnight flight landed very early at 6am, and we were all very tired. The hotel arranged a hassle-free airport pick up and transfer directly to the resort by speedboat. Upon arriving, we were told official check-in was not until 2pm, but were offered an early check in option which included an extra day's buffet breakfast and a free 20 minute massage for two. The additional charge was around USD50 per room which turned out to be a very good deal.

The resort covers a large area and includes a wide range of accommodation, including standard rooms, private villas and treehouses. To access many of the rooms and facilities requires either a short buggy ride or a long walk (the buggies were widely available around the resort). We booked a basic deluxe king room, which in itself was very spacious, and we particularly appreciated the large bathtub and the terrace with two loungers and a table.

The breakfast buffet was incredible - a huge selection of western and Asian food, highlights of which included roasted suckling pig, whole steamed seabass and a ""donut wall"". We had so much food each morning that we didn't really need lunch on any of the days we were there. We also ate dinner at the resort on both nights - the first at the treehouse restaurant which specialized in Mediterranean food, the second at the seafood restaurant which had great views over the beach. Both dinners were excellent, the only disappointment being that by the time we ordered at the seafood restaurant around 7.30pm, they had already run out of certain recommended items such as lobster and razor clams.

There is a huge range of facilities and activities around the resort. We spent much of our time enjoying the two private beaches, both with white sand and crystal clear water. The setting on one of the beaches nestled within a bay, with stunning rock formations on either side, is gorgeous, and you can also see hundreds of fish by snorkeling as close as 10-20m from the shore. There are also three swimming pool areas - the infinity pool in particular was very nice, much quieter and removed from the busy kids pool with views out to the ocean. The gym is well equipped and modern, with steam and sauna. There is a large and secluded spa area and the 20 minute massage included in our room package was excellent - my wife opted to extend hers by another hour. Finally there is a daily schedule of various activities and entertainment such as fitness/yoga classes, dance performances, live music, organized walks, etc, but we didn't end up joining any of these.

The only small downside is that the hotel is very remote, located right at the northern tip of the island with limited road access. This wasn't a huge problem because the hotel organizes direct speedboat transfers to the airport, and also the resort is so large you can easily spend your whole time there. If you did want to venture to the southern part of the island however, this requires getting a tuk-tuk or waiting for the hourly shuttle bus. The one occasion we ventured out ended up being a massive hassle. Firstly, waiting 10-15min for a tuk-tuk willing to take us to the place we wanted to go, secondly being stuck in a 45min stationary traffic jam on the only road out due to a drainage pipe leaking and completely flooding the road, and finally an attempt to be charged double the amount the hotel quoted for the ride by the driver due to the jam.

All in all, we had an amazing 3-day stay in Boracay at this resoirt. We enjoyed it so much that we would definitely consider returning again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"If you have read or skimmed the book ""Lost Horizon"", you will understand Shangri-La, and how the hotel uses this theme. This is Shangri-La / This is Paradise.
We stayed in Tree House Villa which is at the top of the property with a perfect view of most everything. The pickup and return to Caticlan airport was exceptional. The speedboat ride to the property's dock really set an excellent start to the journey. Once there we really felt special, as many of the staff went out of their way to do little things, that shows attention to the guest. The beach, the food, the spa all top shelf. The type of place you want to come back to visit time and time again. Looks like the photos and videos",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We stayed at Shangri-La Boracay for four days during September in a premier sea view room. Compared to beach resort holidays in Mauritius and South Africa, this resort takes the cake. And easily.

The staff are attentive, friendly and informative, and had some great recommendations when it came to trying local food and drink. Lester at the pool bar really took great care of us. There's literally nothing they won't do for their guests.

The location is picture-perfect. (They did host a wedding during our stay, and it's really not hard to see why couples choose this resort to tie the knot.)

There's tonnes to do at the resort. Snorkeling, paddle boarding, kayaking. There are two beaches and a resort swimming pool- all watched by lifeguards, so if you plan on traveling with kids, they will swim safely here. (You can also rent snorkel gear, life jackets and floats to use the pool and ocean). For rainy days, they have an entertainment area where you can play pool, shoot hoops, try table tennis or air hockey, play Wii or X-box or enjoy watching sports on a big-screen. There's also a separate facility for small kids where they have their own activities. Motorised water sports like banana boating, diving and parasailing is organised by the resort for guests with a third-party supplier.

There is no shortage of food choices in the resort either. With four restaurants and bars to choose from, you're not going to go hungry. One day you're chilling pool-side eating a pizza and the next you're tucking into delicious Mediterranean cuisine in the tree tops. There are meals for every taste - Asian, Indian, American, Healthy, etc. (Try their local rum, Don Papa.)

Our room was extremely comfortable and had all the amenities you'd expect from a five-star resort. Mariane from housekeeping went as far as drawing a relaxing bubblebath for us when they saw we went out early one morning for a snorkel in the ocean. These little touches are excellent!

The resort has buggies that drive guests around within the resort and has a small shop with sunscreen, swimwear, flip-flops, ice cream, etc (if you forget anything at home).

We took a flight from Manila to Cataclan with Philippine Air and were transferred to the resort's boat lounge in a mini bus. From there we were transferred to the resort via speedboat. (During stormy weather they change the route for the safety and comfort of the guests.) On a sunny day, the boat transfer takes 20min between the Cataclan boat lounge and the resort. The resort representative at the airport has a bright red jacket on, so he is very easy to spot.

One thing that I am slightly disappointed with is the amount of trash on the coral reef. (It says more about the state of our oceans than the resort itself), but nonetheless, a little sad.

We will definitely be back! We loved this resort and the staff that make it so special.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"Our PAL Jet landed in Caticlan, was transferred to the old terminal building via buses and after we got our luggage, was whisked off to the Shangrila waiting area near the pier. This waiting area is most pleasant, air conditioned and provided with coffee and tea facilities. Our boat transfer to Boracay island was delayed due to the high turbulence of the seas. Using their alternate boarding area, we finally got to Boracay.
Check in was quick. Lunch of salad and soup was taken at the checkin area but we decided to have it served at the coffee shop, Vintana Cafe.
The room was quite a walk from the reception area but we found it welcoming, clean and well appointed. Very nice surroundings.
After a quick nap, we took a swim in the secluded beach front and on to the pool designed with many secluded coves provided with air jets, that relaxes our back and legs. We returned via golf cart that dropped us at station 1 just a few steps from our room. What service! They thought of all these little conveniences!
Our group had a dinner reception by the beach. This was the longer beach beside their private beach. The setting was beautiful and we marveled at the sunset as we enjoyed our drinks and grilled delicacies. Service was impeccable!

We will definitely come back!",Food:Location:Staff
"If location and space are two main criteria for getting a no.1 spot Shangri La has it covered. The property has one private bay/beach and another semi-private beach which (for now) it is the only hotel fronting.
For space you could choose the tree top villas which have almost 2000 sq feet of personal space, balconies, jacuzzi and a very large bathroom as well as a powder bathroom for day use.
We found the service impeccable with friendly smiles from even the security and housekeeping staff.
Pluses: Great buffet breakfast, great Italian fine dining, good seafood restaurant, great variety of bars. Private dining on the beach option.
Minus: Being in a tree top villa means either walking to and from the beach (good for digestion at a 160 feet above sea level) or waiting for the buggies to fetch you which at peak hours may mean a 10 to 15 minute wait. By the way tree top is figurative. You are not in a tree but up the side of a steep hill surrounded by trees and landscaping on two storey self contained villas.
Stand out staff: Lazarus the resort manager. Always walking around and checking on things. Many of the restaurants had great staff too.

My son had a peanut allergy and they were happy to help us with our questions and we had no problems.

Both the private and the public beaches were very quiet and we never had trouble getting chairs, umbrellas etc. They provided us with snorkeling equipment and we were able to see plenty of fish and starfish right off the beach. (They did not have a good supply of kids equipment however)

It is insanely far for us, otherwise this would be our go-to spot for beach vacations.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Shangrila Boracay is a nice place - nice room, very good wifi connectivity, great food and amenities, relaxing views and just like my previous stay, nice and warm welcome during our arrival.

But the poor luggage and concierge service this time made me doubt Shangrila's ""paradise experience"". We were clear that we wanted to go to D Mall but our luggages were loaded to the van going to the boat that ferries people to Caticlan. We had to wait for about 1.5 hours for our luggages and finally be boarded to the correct van. During this long wait, nothing was done to check or even offered by the concierge, not even water to drink, when we've already lounging in the lobby for quite some time. If we hadn't followed up, no one would have bothered to check whether the luggages were brought back or whether we can get to the next shuttle leaving for D Mall.

Not a great way to end a supposedly nice stay. Maybe we haven't chalked up enough nights yet to receive very good overall customer experience from Shangrila... selective in that sense? Oh well.",Food:Location
"it is too good to be true...

amenities - more than what you could ask for

"Such a hard place to actually get to, 3 plane trips and a speed boat from Melbourne but the time we spent here was fabulous. A resort with the lot that you literally dont ever have to leave it, everything is catered for and thought through.

From the moment you arrive at the jetty, you get picked up in the golf carts and are brought to the door of the resort. The staff are incredible in terms of service, there wasnt a staff member that walked past in the week I was there that didnt say hello/greet me as I walked past... amazing, so good.

Luxurious apartments, beautiful beaches, great places to eat. My fave had to be the extraordinary breakfast buffet that is on offer... every single need and want has been catered for... one of the best breakfast selections you will ever experience.

A world class resort.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"We had an amazing and relaxing stay at this hotel. We decided to stay here for our last night in Boracay and it was definitely a great choice! The staff of Shangri-La were very friendly and polite. We enjoyed everything; from the food, to the amenities and the amazing view!",Staff:Food:Location
"It was our first time in a Shangri La, I visited with my husband and 5 year old daughter we enjoyed every minute (despite the rain)!

We flew into Kalibo from Singapore and transfer was over 2 hours including 30 min boat ride, this was only negative of this trip.

Facilities were amazing, pool was fab and my daughter didn't want to get out! The kids zone and entertainment zone also great especially in rainy season!

Every meal we had was delicious, the buffet breakfast was amazing and the choice was unreal, my daughter very happy with ice cream at breakfast! We also ate in the lobby bar, beach bar, seafood restaurant and Italian (Rima). Rima being our favourite the food was amazing and the service even better! Also kids menus available in all restaurants which is fab in a 5 star hotel as often not available in top restaurants!

All the staff we met were great nothing too much trouble, polite and friendly! My daughter loved the buggy service to and from restaurants, drivers even remembered her name and she loved riding in the front! Lester in the beach bar was also great with her making sure her bar stool had lots of cushions so she could see over! One evening when we got back to our room a little gift had been left for my daughter with a personal note she was so excited!

The rooms were spacious, very clean and a great view of the sea. The best bit was my daughter got a child's robe and slippers which was a great little touch!

Overall an amazing experience, the little family touches made it even better for us!",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Located at a base of a hill this property is really beautiful. When we were reaching the resort in their speed boat, we just couldn’t get over the view. Only problem here is reaching the main lobby if your room is located far away, which was the case with us. Otherwise no complains, its just perfect. Early morning you can see the flying foxes at the top of the hill.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"The hotel sits in a great location but the hotel is dated and needs improvements to call itself luxurious. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Food at the restaurants was good. The spa was amazing. It's really the hotel grounds and rooms that where disappointing.

This is a family friendly hotel. Kids are everywhere and there aren't very many adult-only areas to escape.",Staff:Food:Location
"This time around im with my 2 kids and im still very happy with its resort and ameneties.
1. Welcoming
We really like the part where we arrived then they played a Philippine musical instruments. My kids loved it. The entrance never gets old. We love the dramtic style of it. Unfortunately unlike our previous stays, nobody approached and assisted us with our check in. Its good that we are a bit familiar on what to do so we just walked to the reception directly and my wife did all the work. The employees are very accomodating and also helpful.

The kids enjoyed the adventure zone area where they played and slide for like an hour. This is a very good place to stay if youre still waiting for your room.

2. Guestroom - though we just booked the room infront of the garden, we still have a good view on our veranda. As expected, the room was very clean and some welcome treats for the kids. The bathtub was also filled with water and bubble bath with rose petals on it. There was also a sofa bed where my kids slept after swimming.

3. Pool and Beach - In my opinion, Shangrila has the best swimming pool design in boracay. The pool was also salt-water treated hence its really not harmful for the eyes. My kids never had the ""red eyes"" after every swimming. The beach was also well kept and very clean. Unlike in station 1, though youre also paying a premium, once you go to the beach area, you will see plastic wrappers, plastic bottles floating on the beach. The privacy is another great aspect in staying at Shangrila Boracay. Only guests are allowed to roam around the beach front. Theres no sales people walking around and asking you to book for tours, hehe.

4. Vintana and food quality - i think the best about staying in Shangrila is youre guaranteed to have standardized great tasting quality food. This maybe in Vintana, Heat, Circles, etc. They all have great quality of food.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Been visiting this resort for the past few years and they still make it a memorable experience for my family.

The food is a bit of an issue for lunch or dinner. It's best to just have a buffet in your villa. Lots of food and great service.

The hobie cat is a great experience and it's free.",Food:Location
"This was my first time visiting Boracay and I couldn’t imagine staying anywhere else. The Shangri-La in Boracay has spoiled me as far as beach resorts go in the Philippines. The room, the view, the beaches, the food, etc. was all wonderful. My pictures probably don’t do it justice.

There is private boat transfer directly to the resort from Caticlan airport. This helps remove the step of planning transportation as there is no airport on the island that Boracay is on. The closest airport is Caticlan which is on the next island. Once you get to the resort, you are met with a band playing a welcome song and quickly shuffled to a golf cart/buggy to the lobby or directly to a villa if that is where you chose to stay. There is buddy service to take you around the resort since it is quite large.

We stayed in a ‘Loft Villa’ which comes with a private plunge pool. This villa is pretty amazing with probably one of the best views I have ever had in the Philippines. The sunsets are amazing. It is two stories with the bedroom on the top floor and a living area, second bath, kitchen area, and plunge pool access on the lower floor. I was able to check-in and out in the Villa, so I didn’t have to go through the standard lobby. The villa came with butler service which they basically insist you use from basic requests like buggies to bookings via a cellphone provided in the room. Our butler was even answering our calls on her days off. It was a nice touch. It also included breakfast where you could either go to the lobby restaurant for the breakfast buffet or have private dining in the Villa. We mostly chose the private dining in the villa and had it outside by our pool due to the amazing view. The Tapsilog was to die for. I am not a breakfast eater, but I could eat their Filipino breakfast every day for the rest of my life. It probably ruined me for any other Tapsilog in the Philippines.

The hotel has a private beach and a ‘semi’ private beach area. We found that the ‘semi’ private beach was the most private because most people went to the pool or the private beach. There were times that we were the only ones on the beach. There have basic watersport equipment that is free to use at the beach such as snorkeling equipment, paddle boards, and kayaks.

The restaurant selection at the resort is alright. I think our favorite was the beach/poolside bar and restaurant. My only complaint would be that it closed too early. I think during the time we were there (Nov 2016-Dec 2016), that bar closed around 8pm. Who stops drinking at 8pm on vacation?!?

There is free shuttle vans every 30 minutes to an hour (depending on time of day) that can take you directly to the D-Mall area of Boracay around station 2. This was a good way to get the action of the main area, but also come back to your private resort for peace and quiet.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Away from the hustle and bustle of Boracay, Shangri-La's Boracay is a very beautiful resort with luxurious rooms, gorgeous amenities, excellent service. Their pools are amazing and both of their private beaches are algae-free, definitely the cleanest and clearest in Boracay! Everything has a touch of luxury. With so many dining options and activities to do, you won't get bored here.",Location
"Had a week stay over Easter period. Felt very welcome from the moment you arrived at the airport. Though it was the peak season, we didn't feel cramped or too busy in the resort. Reasonable sized room overlooking the pier and beach. In room condition and amenities were good. Very Shangri-la deco however was a bit tired at some part of the areas. Nice gym with daily activities. F&B was pretty average. Complimentary 16-seater van to Station 2 was a plus. Think it is the only 5-star hotel chain in Boracay, so not a lot to choose from honestly and it was pretty pricey for its value. All-in-all, we had a pleasant stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"I expected nothing but the best and as always Shangri-La delivered. I have known their resort back in Cebu for their impeccable customer service and they did not fall short here in Boracay.

I am so happy we picked this place instead of the beach stations. Although i do enjoy people watching sometimes, perhaps my age is catching up on me and I now prefer the peace and quiet this tropical paradise offers.

From airport pick-up to arrival, everything was hassle- and stress-free. Staff attends to your needs politely and as promptly as possible. They do not even dilly dally and wait around for tips. You can tell they definitely want to make their customers happy and satisfaction is their goal.

The resort is clean, well-maintained and beautiful with its landscaping and overall decor. Like a mix of modern and tropical. The moment you step into their lobby, you can absolutely say ""now this is what i call a vacation!"". The ambiance becons you in itself.

They offer 7 different restaurants to fit you appetite, your mood and your style. Both pools and beaches are gorgeous! I could swim in them all day but i'd be fried from the heat lol I love that this resort is private and have their own beach front too.

My review will do no justice from the exceptional experience I always get to have while staying at a Shangri-La resort but the Shangri-La here in Boracay is a whole new level! Definitely one of the best resorts in the Philippines!",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Most people know that you can’t really go wrong with a Shangri-La hotel and the resort in Boracay is really no exception.
First off, if you are from the Philippines or are heading there on vacation then someone somewhere will have told you about the pristine beaches of Boracay. Unfortunately a little too many people have been told about Boracay and it is about the most touristy and commercial holiday destination you can get. Absolutely great for an 18 to 30’s holiday, not so much if you want to relax a little.
Thankfully, the Boracay Shangri-La has us covered. The resort is set off to one corner of the island and is separated from the main white beach from a large rock formation jutting out. To get to Boracay from Manila you either fly to Caticlan or Kalibo, both of which are a 45 minute flight time. From Caticlan as you will need to take a 15 minute boat ride from the ferry port (5 minutes from the airport) to get to Boracay Island itself. If you landed in Kalibo you would need to take the same boat ride but it would be about a 45 minute journey from the airport to the ferry port. Since you have spent all that money staying at the Shang they offer a private speed boat to ferry you direct to the resort which saves a ton of time waiting around and is much more comfortable.
Once you get to the resort you get the standard welcome drinks and cold towel and check in is nice and quick due to the many counters available. From there you hop into a six seater golf buggy which will drive you to your room/villa. I actually stayed in a Villa back in 2010 and whilst exquisite I did find that they are a little too far away from the main pool/bar area of the resort. This time I stayed in the premier sea view rooms which sit right on top of the large beach and we found it a little easier to get around as it meant we could walk as opposed to having to wait for a buggy to pick us up each time.
The rooms are nice and spacious with a large bathroom. The rooms have a bathtub and a rainfall shower. Unfortunately the pressure in the shower wasn’t too great and there seemed to be very little difference between dialling in hot and cold.
The rooms also have a nice balcony (veranda) which have two beds you can lay out on. The main bed is firm but comfortable and house keeping provide four large bottles of water to your room each day. The problem I have with the room is that the curtains do not fit all the way across so it leaves a gap of about 6 inches for the sunlight to wake you up at 5:30pm, pretty uncharacteristic of a Shangri-La hotel along with us having issue with our key card and room lock.
The main pool area is nicely laid out with its accompanying beach. You can find a poolside bed to lay on and camp out there all day without worrying about much else other than relaxing. The pool is nice and large, has a Jacuzzi and is kept warm by the sun. The beach sand isn’t quite a talcum powder like as the main white beach on the island but you’ll not be complaining due to the exclusivity of it.
There are really only three restaurants in the resort and two bars (discounting the games room as a bar). The pool bar closes at 10pm with a few people commenting that they would like to sit around the pool and have a drink much later than that. There is however another bar that is open until 1am but it doesn’t quite have the relaxing charm of sitting near the pool despite a large open fire to keep you warm in 30c heat, it does look nice though. Both bars offer the usual bar type snacks and are of good quality, I recommend the Kofte Wrap!
The fine dining restaurants are an Italian and basically a seafood restaurant, both had limited menus as far as I am concerned and whilst the food was nice the portions were quite small. The third restaurant houses the breakfast buffet and offers a more homely selection of dishes, but I still felt a little limited by the choices available. There is also quite a limited beer menu from all the bars and restaurants which isn’t necessarily odd for the Philippines, but I would like to see the Shang offer a little more than the standard San Miguel pale and light.
Checkout can be a bit of a pain with the boat only leaving each hour, however once you get to the Caticlan ferry port you can sit and wait all you like in the private Shangri La area before you are transported to the airport.
We were there in July for a wedding which was organized very well, I would expect us to return to this resort despite not having much love left for the island of Boracay itself.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"I have wanted to write a review for a while. My husband and I stayed here in mid December 2016 for 3 nights. The weather was perfect. The rooms are well appointed, we had an ocean front room. We also had several spa services, facials and massages. All amazing. The resort property is nothing short of gorgeous.
The breakfast buffet is bountiful and you will find something you like no doubt.
The hotel grounds itself are gorgeous . The greenery, the flowing water through the hotel.

The reason I gave this place a 4 star review instead of 5 is because they are sorely lacking in the wine /food department. Everywhere you go they offer you wine that is well below anything a 5 star resort let alone a Shangri-la would offer. I'm talking barefoot wines, not even a half way decent cab from California. Lastly, while the breakfast buffet is good, the rest of the culinary experiences were not that great. Food was just OK. Not at the level of a 5 star in Asia.

We also took the shuttle to the small town center in Boracay one day. We went to the outdoor mall and walked the beach. It was a 4-5 hour excursion. A good place to get some souvenirs and eat something off the resort.",Food:Value for money:Location
"Shangri-la in Boracay has been one of the best Shangri-La's we have stayed at globally.
Food: from the multiple restaurants/cafes/bars we have had no complaints. Portions are great, taste amazing and and drinks/cocktails have been wonderful. Views from all Places are also spectacular. They even go out of their way for dietary restrictions to make sure you are happy and always satisfied.
Staff: the friendliest and most professional staff. All look immaculate and are always so happy to assist in anyway with a huge smile and welcoming nature. Also extremely prompt.
Facilities: all are incredibly high class- from the gym, entertainment centre etc. The best is that there are so many activities included in your stay and the flexibility with these are amazing- such as snorkling, beach activities, tours etc. Other activities that require extra are also so easy to organise from here. Free and convenient shuttle that goes to and from other areas of Boracay makes for excellent site seeing also. There is a buggy service within the resort for easy access to and from the differing cafes, pools, private beach etc so walking too far in such big resort has never been an issue.
Overall the fact it is situated on it's own separate piece of beach/land makes staying here feel so exclusive and special. It is completely a self sustained paradise with easy access to the city/markets if needed. We stayed for 7nights and not a single day was boring, nor was there ever an issue.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"First, I like that they have their own waiting lounge and speedboat. Knowing that Caticlan pier and Boracay streets are always jammed pack, having their own speedboats is definitely a plus.

Since this is our first time in Shangri-La Boracay resort, they gave us a complimentary upgrade to their premier deluxe sea view room. It was indeed a nice view but it's a bit far from the restaurants and pool. The room was very spacious and the view was indeed spectacular.

Though they have a 4 restaurants, only 1 is open for breakfast and lunch. Thus, guests have no other choice. There is a few selection in their menu and in our 3 day stay, not one food satisfied us in terms of taste.

They offer a complimentary shuttle to d'mall (station 2) and this is the worst experience we had. Unlike in Shangri la mactan, guests are to be listed on the schedule they want to ride. But here they only apply a first come first serve basis which caused problems and chaos. Since their schedule going back to the resort is on an hourly basis, we were at the waiting area 15 mins before the schedule time. However, due to the long queue we were not accommodated in the van. Worst is no one is there to assist us or even call the hotel to send more vans. I called the hotel twice to ask them if they could send more van since there are a lot of us waiting there (18 people with most of us have kids in tow). They keep on saying that they will send more vans but no one else came. In short we waited for almost 2 hours just to get a ride back to the hotel! This is very disappointing and unacceptable.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

I would definitely want to stay here again should I come back to boracay.,Location:Food
"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!!

I cannot even begin to describe how wonderful our stay at Shangri-la was. From the moment we arrived at the waiting lounge in Caticlan, until we were whisked away by the speed boat, we arrived at the lobby, the room, the breakfast buffet, the gym, the pool, and most especially the service.

Any hotel chain can set up a multi-million resort, but it's really the people working that makes the difference. Everyone in Shangri-la was all smiles, polite, they stop and greet you. They bring you water when it's too hot, you don't even have to ask. The GM went down the breakfast area to share pleasantries with the guests. It's the little things that count. And it means so much to me because I've experienced bad racial profiling from Ascott BGC (my partner's a foreigner and I'm a local).

I also want to commend Shangri-la for hiring handicapped employees and giving them a chance to have a purpose and contribute to society. There was a pool boy whom I believe is deaf/mute and he was the hardest working and most attentive pool boy there.

Shangri-la makes you feel welcome. I can't wait to go back!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Arriving in style via the private boat launch starts your time at the Shangri La its a superb place for a laid back holiday break, we just enjoyed seven days there and it was magical. The staff are 11/10 and without exception were wonderfully trained, friendly and seemed genuinely pleased to assist you always. The grounds are immaculate and the pool ( pools ) were great. Rima the italian restaurant was terrific , its high on the hill with with tasty food and good selection of wines from around the world. Vintana for breakfast has a great buffet and selection to suit everyone ( even have the donut wall for the young at heart ) and they make great omelettes. Laulita, Dion and Dante around the pool and beach, all had a sense of humour, smiling and engaging with all our large group of guests. Good sized room with all the amenities and facilities you need, but get out and enjoy the private beaches for a swim or snorkel and ly by the pool with a cool drink. If I had the chance the only change would be to arrive via helicopter and beat the transfer and the bus and private boat transfer as if weather is choppy the long way back to airport seems a drag.

Once arrived in the shore they welcomed us "" Welcome to Paradise!"" so beautiful water, sand and beach, better that Hawaii. Exceptional hospitality.. Once we arrived they let us sat in the lounge and they came to us to check-in the resort. They waived the early check-in fee. They guide us in our room and I was amazed that they are really prepared for our arrival since we are three in the party. The room is already prepared for three person, no questions asked. Very clean room.The housekeeping team is very accommodating with our needs and even with our weirdest request of uncooked rice coz my brother's phone got wet. Kudos to the pool team: the server's are very exceptional, they told us that we can order food outside the menu and the chef can cook for us. The fettucine with clams is a must try and their fried calamari. the lifeguard also followed me to the 7feet pool.

The breakfast buffet is superb.. Kudos to the Sushi chef, he made me my own some salmon nigiri and fruit sushi on the side.. to bad I forgot his name so I can thank him for my wonderful dining experience..

Security and privacy in the resort and around the resort is really observed. We went clubbing and missed the last shuttle service so we have to take a tricycle ride back to the hotel. They only let our ride passed the 1st check point and the shuttle picked us up on the second check point.

"We spent 5 nights at this beautiful hotel and it was a great stay. I doubt I could find better hotel on the island. It was little pricey but I think it was worth every penny.
The hotel is situated away from the crowds but a free of charge shuttle bus runs every hour until late at night. The location is just perfect, the hotel has 1 private and one semi-private beaches, both are beautiful, clean, with enough sun beds. The are 2 swimming pools with bubbly baths. Water was probably too hot in the pools, so we cooled down in the sea.
The rooms are very large, all with balconies. I would recommend to pay an extra for a sea-view room as standard ground floor garden rooms are less charming and don't provide with the same spectacular views... So, our room was large, beds were comfortable. There were all the amenities except a real coffee machine, Nespresso type. I think for the price that we pay per night it is possible to provide with it. Nowadays just a tea pot at a 5 stars hotel looks to be odd.
The room service was great, room always done in the morning, the maids pass by one more time in the evening...
Breakfast was correct with some nice features, such as doughnut wall and honey station. But I was disappointed about the dimsum station as there were dim sums only one time during our stay. Fruits and juices were good, especially mangoes! Coffee could be better... Also cold cuts could be more various and of better quality.
Pool side restaurant was not bad. Service sometimes slow at peak hours but they tried to do their best. The Italian restaurant is fantastic. Fine gastronomic cuisine was beyond our expectations. The sea food restaurant was ok but not our favourite. It misses lightening in the evening and service is slow sometimes. Cocktails were average.
Upon the whole the service in the hotel was great! They really do an effort and care about the clients!
Huge thank you for the kids entertainment zone that is free of charge and has suitable activities for different ages. We were impressed by free of charge basketball game, baby foot, ping pong table etc. We travelled with the kids aged 11 and 6 yo and I must say the kids really enjoyed the stay. We also loved the fire dance show on the beach every evening.
My husband and my son used the dive center few times and were also very happy with that.
The only real bémols was the fact that the hotel charged the total amount of our stay more than a month prior our arrival. I booked a stay at the full price, it was not a super-discounted rate, and I was very surprised to see money go straight after the booking. 5 stars hotel rarely charge guests about one month and a health before the stay!
Any way this was compensated by the amazing sunsets that we could observe every evening from our balcony at Shangri la Boracay :)",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"This review is based upon our two-week stay in March 2017, the third time in three years that my wife and I spent our holidays here. Meanwhile we tried several other premium resorts across Asia but decided to return.

For sure, not everything was perfect during our latest stay. We were disappointed seeing the resort turning into a distasteful ‘theme park’ with multiple events organized weekly. During our previous stays, events typically took place on the side of the Punta Bunga beach to minimize disturbance of hotel-staying guests. But nowadays they seemed to have spread to every part of the resort, including on the Banyugan beach. While such events took place for hours, the preparation work and testing lasted for the entire day and hotel guests were blocked access to that part of the beach.

Also, the menu and cuisine quality at Sirena Restaurant deteriorated considerably compared to a year ago, no longer up to the caliber of a Shangri-la resort. It should be possible to offer Asian-inspired cuisine with much better taste and higher standard.

On the positive side, Shangri-la Boracay still boasts a superb location and excellent facilities - beautiful beaches, lush vegetation, an upscale gym and so on. The buffet breakfast at Vintana is a true feast. Rima, the Italian restaurant, is a must try and we especially recommend its Ravioli Ripieni. Notably, the service quality of many of Rima’s staff is top notched. After all, with the opening of an increasingly number of classy new resorts in premium location South East Asia, service makes the ultimate difference.

Our special thanks go to the F&B team – the attentive managers as well as the servers, especially Gina and Gaile at Vintana during breakfast, Dion and Jerryco at the beach bar, and Salvador at the pool. We appreciated their smile, enthusiasm, hearty care and professionalism.

Despite an excellent location and a winning team, a paradise can slip into a paradise lost. Still we remain optimistic about the management’s timely attention, and we love the warmth of the people of the Philippines. We will be back soon!",Food:Location:Staff
"My husband and I came here to celebrate our 5th anniversary. We quite enjoyed and satisfied with our stay here from the food to the resort facility, cleanliness of the room and its surrounding, courteous staff. I would definitely come back here if I get a chance again!",Staff:Food
Stayed in Shangrila for 3 days and it's just heaven. Wish we stayed for a few more days. The Loft villa is so perfect. We will definitely go back. Mark our butler and Lazarus were so attentive to our need. And one more thing everywhere you go the staff were always smiling,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Yes, it is indeed paradise. I was completely in awe seeing the place for the first time. My room was on the 3rd floor, and it was far from the reception lobby area. I did not realize earlier that there's a buggy station near my room that can take me to the lobby and around the place. At night, the hallway towards hotel rooms are dark and kinda creepy actually. I wish they had better lighting on the place. The room was very spacious, as well as the bathroom. My stay was very comfortable. They have safety deposit box, iron, ironing board, hair dryer, hot and cold shower, bathtub, electric heater, refrigerator, aircon, cable TV and speaker at the bathroom (for the TV) though there is no microwave oven. I think the bath essentials such as liquid soap, shampoo and conditioner has zesty or gingery scent. It wasn't really okay for me but maybe some would think it is refreshing. There's WiFi access in all areas of the hotel, up to the beach, and it's pretty reliable. The buffet selection for breakfast is good specially the ice creams! I just didn't like the sunny side up eggs because they were cooked in the griddle, not in a frying pan. They provide speed boats from/to the port and shuttle vans to D' mall. The beachfront is super relaxing and not crowded in the morning. The service was exceptional. Everyone was really helpful and accommodating, they even gave me packed breakfast because I left the hotel around 5 am. My experience was pretty good, well they say it is the most expensive hotel in Boracay and it served its purpose. :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"The first word I was welcomed with is ( welcome to the paradise) . Which I believe it was proven just the opposite the moment I entered the room . I have chosen the premium Seaview room , which I discovered that it is just the same as the deluxe Seaview room which suppose to be from a lower category. So DO NOT be fooled by the names . The second surprise was the room rate it self , I have contacted the official shangri la site to upgrade the room & they give a price of 114000 PSP , but when I negotiate the rate upon arrival here the rate went down to 79000 pesos . It is a great thing to use your negotiation skills even with the hotels , which I think it is not ethical at all .
To pay an amount of 2300 $ for 4 nights is really not worth it in this hotel . And I will show you the reason in the photo attached .
I was really disappointed since I was expecting a higher standard level .
The wall was cracked , the chair in the balcony was old enough to give you a fear of setting on it . Shower fill with corrosion. Cabinet door never closes .
Never ever try this hotel since they are lacking the basic of tourist experience & moral behavior.",Value for money
"I stayed here for 5 nights with my mum for our birthdays and we were definitely spoilt! Such a relaxing experience away from all the noise, parties and tourists of the famous white beach in Boracay! The staff are very accommodating, they even surprised us with cakes and balloons laid out on our bed. Also, I've left MOST of my things when I checked-out and they have shipped it back to me in one piece. The thing I was most crazy about was their fitness room/gym - it looks waaay way better than the high-end gyms in Manila! This resort is highly-recommended!",Food
"This may be the finest property I have stayed at in my life. This Resort has everything that one would look for in a 5 star resort (great service, great amenities, great pools, views, work out facilities, restaurants), but in every category, the Shangri La hits in my top 3, which is incredibly rare. The staff, across the board, is perhaps the finest anywhere. Not only are the knowledgeable and helpful but they go about their jobs with a contagious attitude of genuine enthusiasm and care for the guest that I have not seen equalled. The chef, Patrick Buttgereit, is exactly who you want running the show at a resort like this. His talents are outstanding, and like the other staff at the resort, he is a great front man who loves to talk food and will take special requests. He made a Thai German Steak Schnitzel (I know it sounds funky) that blew us away. In fact, it was the best meal of our entire Asia trip and maybe in the top 5 meals I have ever had. He and his staff hit it out of the park when it comes to the food. The views here are not ridiculously amazing as the resort is perched on a private stretch of white sand beach, which in my opinion, is a far better stretch of beach than any other beach on Boracay.
If you are looking for a place in the Philippines to knock your socks off, get here....right now.....seriously!",Staff:Food
"We thought it will be the best choice to finish our honeymoon but we were so disappointed...
First the activities that the hotel offers is so so so expansive! Like triple expansive than they offer in the center.
The sercvice is very low! Our airconditioner was leaking, we said it to the staff first thing in the morning, they didnt do anything about it. After we told them again they fixed it.
Im vegetarian and I took the vegtables pie at breakfast, sadly it was with ham!!! We ordered a night snack to our room and at night I found out that it was probably rotten...
More things like the key didnt work. But the worst was that after the check out weve waited more than 35 min to the boat to take us back! After they sent our luggage in another boat!!! We were so pissed!

The positive thing about shangri lais that the staff were very nice! From the drivers to the house keeping. The breakfast was good and high qualified. And that gave us a wine ti celebrate our honey moon.
But Ill probably won't come back ever.",Staff:Food
"Lovely place, great service. Stayed in treetops villa with amazing views. Our favourite restaurant was rima
Food was great in all of the restaurants but a little pricey, as was the spa. You could get much cheaper treatments in town.
The beds were a bit hard for me but the views made up for that!
A special mention for Jomar and Glen in concierge, they were wonderful- very good at their job.",Food:Staff:Location

"My wife and I spent five very nice nights at the resort. We arrived by plane at Caticlan Airport, from where we were transferred to the resort's own lounge beside the wharf, then onto the resort's speed boat straight to the resort itself. Check-in was very pleasant and efficient. We stayed in a deluxe seaview room, which was very nice and spacious and which had an expansive view of the sea. Breakfast (included in the tariff) was provided in a nice, large room and was a nice combination of eastern and western cuisines. We also partook in the complimentary shuttle to D' Mall for a change of scenery, eat out and see White Beach. But the resort has several very nice restaurants/bars of its own. The location is really lovely, with beaches within the resort. All of the staff were very obliging and unfailingly helpful. Beautiful.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Was pleased to find that there was no ""green algae"" on either of the two beaches of the resort. The way the property was designed showed regard for both the natural flora and fauna to thrive. The facilities are excellent. What is more delightful is the attitude and heart for service of the Filipino staff who work here. On the beach, they anticipate your needs and serve you fruit-infused water with a hospitable smile, especially ""DION"" who was always on the run to serve. I also appreciate ALDRIN and MELCHOR the lifeguards who helped my son, when he got stung by some sort of floating jelly fish tentacle. Their coordination to render first aid, - EMZ, the lady security officer offered to carry my son to ride the buggy. I appreciate the sincerity of the staff here. They don't have a service bias for Filipino guests.

I suggest they offer more dining options/alternatives especially for kids.",Staff:Food

"This place is AMAZING. When we arrived my ten year old son said ""Is this a dream?"" which really sums it up - it is surreal.
The food was superb, as were the pools overlooking the torqouise water of the beach. The private beach was awesome and very different from the beaches in the other stations, which were filled with algae.
I enjoyed a treatment at the Chi spa which was an unforgettable experience.

"Shangri-La is everywhere. Everytime I visit Makati, I would always stay in Shangri-La Makati beacuse it is near the shops and business offices. Even when I am with my family, we would choose Shangri-La Boracay due to it's classic vibe and excellent ammenities.",Location:Food
"When i first arrived I wasn't prepated for the size of this resort but actually there are shuttle buses that take you around the site anytime. EThere are areas within resort that have their own dining area and some have own pools as well. There are pools down at the beach which are lovely and the two beaches are perfect with nobody trying to sell you hat, sunglasses etc. Definitely recommend even if you like me are not a golfer but like a bit more peace and quiet. I had four nights here and then they transferred me to the other side of the Island where i had booked a Hotel on white beach.
Rooms spacious and breakfast buffet with lots of choice.
Staff were lovely and friendly and helpful.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"First, the island of Boracay is all it's said to be, beautiful sugar white sandy beaches, crystalline water, and skies all shades of blue. We selected Shangai-la in part because of the reviews we read and the reputation of Shangai-La as a resort. We have 4 children 7-18 and thought a bigger resort with more activities and amenities would be better for a family vacation. We also thought that, after splurging nearly £10,000 for a week on a villa we had bought ourselves a bit of exclusivity. We were wrong. It starts with having to wait for a minibus because they ran out of space, waited for a boat, because thy rN out of space, and sat around for 1 hour before checking in because of the number of people in the lobby. With nearly 600 people at capacity (from one of the staff) the resort in high season is overwhelmed. We witnessed 1 wedding every day, some days 2, with its concomitant group of partygoers, and every venue was very crowded, but never as much as breakfast, where we invariably waited 10 minutes for a table, had dirty plates sitting around, and getting coffee served was hit and miss. Staff is lovely and helpful, beach is beautiful, pool is large and spread out, but for the money we expected less chaos and less of a feeling of a mass market resort. Buffet breakfast and dinners are varied with good selection of local and international dishes, but it felt like eating in a mess hall. Also expect to pay for 1 what it costs for 6 for dinner outside the resort. But Whitesands town is the worst u would spect from a mass tourist town that's grown unchecked: loud, dirty, crowed and chaotic, so not much of an option, unless u like that sort of a thing. Verdict: luxury at a price but value for money, in my opinion isn't there because of the mass market feel of the resort. And unfortunately not something Shangai-La can change at this point.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I was there with quite a large group of people for a business/pleasure event and without a doubt, this venue exceeded all expectations for me. The entire group was so well taken care of from the time we got off the plane until our fine departure. The Shangri-La property was outstanding. The guest rooms and villa's had everything you could need and more. We loved having the convenience of the butler for our every need including helping us set up an impromptu DJ session with minimal notice.
The breakfast buffet is an absolute treat! You could eat there all day and be happy.
Our meeting space was perfect, in the Serina restaurant area along with the best view one could ask for during lunch.
The staff were incredibly helpful and accommodating for our every need. On one day we had several people doing different activities and the extra help they provided me with as the event coordinator made it all flow so smoothly. I was extremely grateful for the backup.
I would recommend this resort to anyone for business, family or a romantic getaway. I did have the pleasure of staying in all areas of the island and while each area had its own charm and the hotels were lovely as were ALL the people... but the Shangri-La is on a completely different level than the rest of the island.",Staff:Food:Location
"I honestly could not find a single fault with this hotel. I was genuinely blown away by not only how beautiful and stunning the hotel itself was, and the views were, but by the service. Although Shangri-La hotels/resorts can be pricey you truly get more for your money with all of the resources, activities and services included in the price of your stay.
Staff go above and beyond for guests and were all so helpful and genuine. We stayed here for my Cousin's wedding which was held on the private beach which was absolutely breathtaking.
Everything was perfect from arrival to departure and I can't thank the staff at the Shangri-La enough for going above and beyond and running the most beautiful resort I have ever been to. Thank you! 10/10!!!!!",Staff:Value for money
"After a lengthy trip with several delays (somewhat not unexpected) we arrived at the resort. It is a large, sprawling property located in the north of the island, separated from the famous white beach by a cliff. The hotel was well equipped, the staff friendly and the restaurants were OK, we always enjoyed the breakfast buffet. The reason for the trip was to re-visit Boracay after being there the first and only time in 1988. I was warned that it would not be the same and was somewhat prepared for it, but it was nevertheless a shock - the whole island is completely over-built... Paradise lost... But we enjoyed our stay in the Shangri-La, the location is perfect and the famous sunset still a spectacle worth seeing. Services were seamless, from the airport pickup to the boat trip up to the resort.",Location:Food:Staff

"My friends have been recommending me to give Sirena restaurant at Shangri-La a try during my trip to Boracay, promising me that I will not be disappointed. Skeptical and yet curious, I decided to give Sirena a try on my birthday and boy was i impressed. The ambience is romantic and quiet, perfect for an evening date out. I was most impressed with the dishes prepared by the chef. Being a true blue Singaporean, I am especially amazed by the fusion of sauces & seafood. The famous Singapore Chilli Crab is now replaced with fresh king prawns, and the sauce used in steamed garoupa is replaced with big lobsters. It was extremely comforting to find Singapore delights in Philippines - makes me feel like I am back at home. Chef Xian even made a special appearance at my table to wish me happy birthday and made sure that we were satisfied with our food. This little action meant alot to my wife and I, because we felt very appreciated. I will definitely visit this restaurant again!",Food:Location
"I booked a 2 nights stay at the Tree House Villa to surprise my partner for our 3rd year anniversary. The room and resort itself was really spectacular. We loved every bits of it! However we are sad to say that there were more cons than pros for our stay!

Pros:
1) The villa was unbelievable! Huge room and really nice view.
2) Superb service! We were always greeted by the staff.
3) Breakfast buffet was really good!
4) Saltwater pool!

Cons:
1) They forgot to decorate our room even though I specifically request them to do so when I was making the reservation via their hotline. When I reminded them again in the confirmation email, I was told they couldn't complied with my request due to time constraint. They left a bottle of wine on our table instead, which was nice of them and we appreciated it but my partner doesn't drink wine so I'd still rather have the decorations. During our 3d2n stay, they didn't even bother doing it when we were out. No one wished us or mentioned anything about the anniversary throughout the whole stay.

2) In room dining and food at Rima was really not good. We couldn't even finish our food.

3) Buggy service wasn't that efficient. We waited around half an hour one day to be picked up from our villa for breakfast. We almost missed breakfast because of that.

4) They overcharged the bill. I chose the holiday villa package which include round trip land and sea transfer from/to Kalibo airport, 1 hour massage for two, 5000 peso f&b credit. They charged me for the massage and airport transfer. I had to sign and was given a bill after the pick up service and after the massage so I know what's the charges for those services. The amount they put on the bill wasn't even close to the amount it's supposed to be. It's some random amount and I felt like they're just putting those charges on the bill hoping we won't notice them. They removed the charges after I pointed them out but still! I also just noticed a few previous reviews mentioning the same issues so please always double check your bill!

5) They forgot to arrange our return transfer to Kalibo airport. I reminded them in the confirmation email, I reminded our butler, I even reminded the front desk when we checkout. When we arrived at the waiting lounge at Caticlan jetty, the staff told us there were no such arrangement. In the end we've to wait for almost half an hour for them to sort things out with the resort and arrange a car for us last minute.

For almost 1000usd per night we were definitely expecting better than what we experienced. We don't mind paying for it but we really wanted this stay to be special. We really loved the room and resort but we are not quite sure if we'd ever returned.",Staff:Value for money:Food

"First of all, the staff is top notch! They are all very welcoming and warm! They are very genuine in their greetings and trying to make our stay memorable. Right from our arrival from the airport, all thru out our 10 day stay, up to our departure!
There are so many activities everyday for both adults and kids, plus the entertainment center has a lot to offer as well! On days which we need to relax, both the main pool and the infinity pools are very relaxing to swim or just sit back and relax. The Chi Spa is another place to really relax with some great massage!
Food on all restaurants are great with awesome view of both beach and sunset! Breakfast is just a feast to the eyes, too many great foods to choose from and only one stomach to fill up with! One can easily gain weight here, that is why the Gym is an great complement to work out all the calories! They have a lot of equipment to use and the trainers are great and know what they are doing!

He kept me posted and even texted me when we was already off duty just to check if my wife received and liked the flowers.

It is absolutely fantastic. The rooms are set on a hillside above the beautiful beaches. It is an easy walk from your room to the beach and pools, but you can request a buggy to take you anywhere on the resort. All of the restaurants are great, even for vegetarians.

We booked a three hour snorkeling trip at the Dive Center, located at the hotel. The local boat took us to Cove Island, which has two interesting cave locations where the ocean splashes in. Then went snorkeling at two different locations. Lot of fun.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I had one of the best valentines experience on this lovely resort. They have everything planned out for valentine's day that they have a menu on what type of experience that you and your significant others would like.

As usual, the interior is cosy and the bed is extremely comfortable. The beaches are secluded and private so you can swim and relax in peace, unlike the beaches in the main stations of boracay where vendors pester you into buying their products.

Breakfast is one of the most glorious moments I have experienced. It would take to long to narrate my experience so I suggest you readers should find out for yourselves.

Check in and Check out process is smooth and fast. Employees give the warmest smiles when they pass by you.

The only irate moment I had with this stay is when they placed me in a room with a obstructed view of the sea, when I specifically booked a sea view room. I booked through their website and I am a Golden Circle member, which I thought would give me a slight advantage over people that booked via Expedia or Agoda. Nevertheless, they transferred me to a room with no view obstruction at 9PM that same night, which was a hassle.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"From the moment we arrived at the Shangri-la Lounge in Caticlan Island, and then taken by speedboat to the resort on adjacent Boracay, we felt truly pampered! The Shangri-la is a stunningly beautiful resort on Boracay that is the ultimate in luxury and relaxation. Despite its private remote location, the resort provides easy access via shuttle vans to White Beach Station 1 and D-Mall where all the action and activity is. The shuttles run every hour during the day and every half hour in the evening. We enjoyed the many dining and drinking options at Station 1, but we were happy to escape back to our retreat at Shangri-la. The restaurants at the resort were also fantastic, and we enjoyed a delicious meal at “Sirena” seafood restaurant and the sunset happy hour at “Cielo” bar. The resort offers two beautiful beaches – a private soft sand beach at Banyugan Beach and the clear turquoise waters and white powdery sand at the semi-private Punta Bunga Beach. The huge free-form pool is great, although I wish there had been an adults-only pool away from the kids and noise. The breakfast buffet is huge and spanned several rooms, and offers all types of cuisine. The free wifi is very fast and reliable. The staff is ever present and helpful, but not intrusive. The only negative is that the resort is a huge complex, so it is not very intimate. Also, we paid an increase in price because it was Chinese New Year, so we should have researched that before making reservations during that time period.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

It's a large resort, lots of walking and you could easily get lost trying to find your room! Free shuttle to and from Station2 where Boracay entertainment is.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I really enjoyed being at the hotel because it was an oasis of relative calm compared to just down the road. Boracay was hectic (the white beach is fabulous, but so many people!)

The spa was gorgeous and a luxurious birthday treat. The signature massage was nice, but at 10 times the cost of a local massage it needed to be.

The views from our room were incredible, and I always looked forward to waking up and seeing the palm trees sway against the blue sky.

Breakfast choices were top class and although I didn't indulge, the donut wall was a quirky little touch for kids and certain grown ups in our party.

The gym was of a good standard for a hotel, and classes in yoga, etc, were available.

The pools were beautiful, and the service we received, both there, and on the beaches, was first class.

The hotel puts on a regular shuttle to town, which is free of charge and leaves every 30 mins.

You're certainly not left with the feeling of being trapped : )

We ate at the various restaurants, and all were of a good standard.

Wifi also worked well for me throughout the resort.

Having been to Boracay both ways now, (luxury and budget-ish) I can safely say the finishing touch, which puts this hotel at the top of the Boracay table, is the airport transfer. The simplicity and lounge experience, coupled with the relatively quick 15 minute speedboat ride, makes this my only choice on Boracay.

It's almost worth it for that alone : )",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We had a great and unforgettable time. Definitely Worth a Visit. Loved the private beach and the lovely Staff. We stayed only 3 nights, next time we will probably stay longer to experience all the acitivities like diving or going on a catamaran trip.",Location
"The hotel buildings are well decorated and impressive with a very big pool by the sea. However, the service is just average. We stayed in another hotel in Boracay and it was much cheaper much better served. The staff is dull, not friendly, they seem unhappy and in the poolside restaurant they sometimes even ignore you.
The hotel owns two beaches and one of those beaches is very very small with very coarse sand and the other one is although big, it is not suitable to swim in front of the hotel because of the high tide. The sand is no where near the sand in white beach, it is coarse and there are huge rock at the sea. This beach becomes better at the other side in which Mövenpick hotel is located.
This is very expensive hotel in Philippines standards and I had a food poisoning the night that we ate here.
The only thing that we enjoyed at this hotel is snorkelling. There are living corals, colourful fishes, sea stars,etc in Punta Bunga beach only 5m away from the shore.

We stayed 2 days at this hotel and during 2 days we had snorkelling all the day for one day and the another day we went back to the white beach which is far better.

For me, I would not stay in this hotel since there are better and locally owned hotels at a better location.",Food:Location
"We booked Shangri-la for the last three nights of our honeymoon in Philippines. The welcome wasn't quite as warm as we expected as our hostess was only interested in selling us an upgrade and also wanted to reserve the full amount for the room again (which was about £1,200 and was already paid 5 months ahead of our arrival) purely on the basis that I changed the name on my bank card after getting married and the card number changed as well.

We stayed in the Premier Sea View Suite and it was big and nicely decorated. Despite the romantic intent, the petal decorated cold bath was probably a bit of a waste of time....likewise we decided to opt out of the helicopter ride and private fireworks display from the à la carte romance menu.

The facilities were amazing though! The swimming pool is really one of a kind - big, in a beautiful location and designed to subtly intertwine with the nature around you. We spent some time in the Entertainment zone where you could play basketball, pool, table tennis and have a drink in a bar with sports channel on. They also have various classes where you can learn how to make something with your own hands, for example an iPhone case made from the pal tree leaves, as well as many other classes that will keep you busy.

And we had the most delicious breakfast over our two weeks in Philippines - various cuisines for any taste.

Also, we were very grateful for the help at the very end of our trip as on the day of our departure, the island was hit with a typhoon, so all the boats from the island were cancelled, which unfortunately meant we would miss our flight to the UK. One of the concierges spoke to the airlines on our behalf and helped to reschedule the flights, they also went to the Coast Guard to organise a letter required for our insurance company and we booked in for another night.

We got a speed board provided by the hotel the next morning and were a little sad to leave the hotel and the island.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"After 4 nights on the white beach, it was so nice to stay in this beautiful resort, calm and clean, the water well preserved. It is so sad Boracay has been destroyed by all the sewage poured directly into the water by cheap hotels. I hope the gouvernement will carefully supervised the sewage and close all illegal litter-bug.
I specially appreciate the no plastic policy of The Shangri-la. Glass water bottle, sustainable containers for amenities.
Breakfast was delicious, lots of fruit and healthy choice.
Nice activities for the kids, my son was so happy to make pizza.
Check-in as usual was quite slow. I hope one day they can make it last less than 10mn.

"The place is in the best location of the island and has all you may need for a great holiday.. However the service is still far below what you can expect from a 5* hotel in Asia when you pay 700 US$ a night as we did.. We had to claim more water bottles, more glasses to drink as they were not even one per person, more shaving kits, of course all delivered by different people at different times in the evening! Eventually my massage booking at the Chi Spa was a disaster as it was missed by the staff and I was offered a massage by the receptionist of the spa at the start!
Well definitely not a good value for money if you compare to other Shangri La's or other places, in spite of the wonderful smiling gentleness of all the staff during our stay..!!",Value for money:Staff:Food
"We came to Boracay for a family wedding which was taking place at the Shangrila. From the time we were picked up at Kalibo airport to the speedboat transfer to the island, Shangrila's quiet efficiency was on display. Our room was spacious and comfortable with a delightful view of the water. Throughout the week we ate at all the restaurants. The Breakfast Buffet was a highlight - so many Asian/European treats available. Both the Seafood and Italian restaurants served delicious meals. The pool area was large and well supervised. The wedding went off without a hitch in a very beautiful setting. The staff were outstanding at this resort - so friendly. Nothing seemed too much trouble. Overall a wonderful week.

"What an end to a fabulous holiday in the Philippines which until this consisted of visiting and exploring the fantastic island of El Nido, diving in Cebu and spending a few days partying on the famous white beach Boracay. To arrive at the Shangri-La for 5 nights of peace, great beaches, fantastic food and service was just what the doctor ordered and we cannot fault our stay in any way. We are extremely thankful to every member of staff at this hotel for treating each guest with such care and for making our stay as perfect as it was. Nothing was too much for anybody and we would love to return. There is such a nice atmosphere at this hotel and the staff are truly incredible – hats off to Shangri-La for employing such dedicated and professional workers. We dined at Rima, Sirena and had drinks at Solana – all highly recommended. Get to Solana before 5pm if you want to watch the sunset in a booth!",Staff:Food
"To all my readers

I am on one month asia tour choosing best places and checking the top resorts to see if they really worth the 5 stars and above they getting.

After very hard time to be able to book a room , i guess cause of the Chinese new year

I succeed throw my concierge at the raffles hotel in manila to find one open for 1 night for the villa .

But its no help , in order to explore at least 3 days needed

I have seen that there is 2 bedroom pool villa available so i talked with their manager and he agreed to discount the price

Still was high only for me , but i guess when you really want something and this case to explore Boracay island and a taste of this particular resort , you just do it .

Flight was delayed about 30 minutes and scary cause of the winds , but the moment landed their stuff welcome you and drive you with a quality van to the waiting room for the speed boat to take you to the resort.

In the waiting room lounge you have wifi and tea and coffee as well as restroom

When boat arrive you jump up and way we go or sail :)

When boat arrive to the entrance of the resort , a warm welcoming with traditional music played by stuff and then a buggy picks you up to your room

In my case my butler welcomed me and show me the villa and went throw all the check in process in the room

He even gave me a phone i can call him or text if need anything

2 bedroom villa is absolutely beautiful and mine also faced the ocean
Nice music in the background , fruits , drinks and very relaxing atmosphere .

I am sure the rest of the rooms amazing as well and they have all kinds of villa different prices
Try not to come on high season or book a head for good prices .

The hotel itself is 15 minutes ride from the main town but they provide free shuttles

And between us you don't feel like leaving your villa nor the resort

Its located between palm trees and lots of nature and has its own private beach

The beach is so amazing and quite and the water has few kind of blue colors ( i just loved it )

To those of you stay on the villa , go to the hotel lobby and lounge its very well decorated and the view is to kill for

I felt in out of this world.

Breakfast has everything and i cant say nothing bad on the food ( i rarely eat anything , and still they had many verities to choose from )

In my book this hotel deserve 5 star and above and guests who stay here can enjoy both world
The quiet and free shuttle away the crazy town life with many bars restaurants and more

Thank you for a small piece of heaven",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"The hotel is what can be expected from Shangri-la, no doubt about it, but the location is horrible. Boracay stands for fine white sands and beautiful acquamarine waters. This hotel, however, is located in a beach that has none of those. The sand is coarse and gray and the ocean floor drops very quickly down, so the waters are dark blue. Furthermore it is not safe for children as it gets deep very quickly and the waves are strong. While expected during the Xmas season, the hotel was very crowded. For the prices you pay, you would expect a little more seclusion. In general Shangrila yes, but not in Boracay.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

"Stayed for 9 nights in the Seaview Suite, lovely view and room. Extremely slow service on the beach. No evening entertainment which was very boring after 7pm as there was nothing to do. Rima Restaurant very good, compliments to the chef. We ate at Rima 6 times however there reservations constantly say they are fully booked but many tables were still available when dining. NYE was a disappointment the food fell below standard for which after much complaining they finally refunded. We believe the problem was due to the hotel catering for numerous events/buffets/restaurants instead of concentrating on 1 main NYE event like most top hotels would do.",Food

The hotel needs renovation, until then do not charge more than 400 euros per night, I really felt I was robbed.

"What an amazing experience! My family spent five nights at the Shangri La Boracay. It was absolutely luxurious.

We stayed in a beautiful suite (one large room), that comfortably slept four without crowding the room or taking away from the living area space. They gave us a cell phone and we had butler service day and night) to assist with reservations and the like). The only drawback to the room is that the bathroom (while huge) does not provide for much privacy. If you're in the shower, anyone in the bathroom can see all of you. If you use the WC, anyone in the bathroom can see all of you. My teenage kid likes his privacy (the nerve), so that meant that no one could get ready at the same time as anyone else.

The included breakfast was excellent. The different entertainment experiences (band, dancers and fire dancers) were all great. The service at all levels (from the bell boys and gardeners, to housekeeping, to the bar and waitstaff) was top notch. We ate at every restaurant and were happy with the food and drink choices. They had a welcome band when you arrived, and provided fresh fruit kabobs while you are laying on the beach. They paid attention to every detail.

The grounds were gorgeous! There were photo opportunities around every corner. It was decorated beautifully for Christmas. You can't beat the sunset. The hotel was full, but it never felt overcrowded.

My kids liked the Entertainment Center, with its ping pong, air hockey and basketball. They also had movies available to checkout and watch in your room. There is supposedly a movie every night on the beach at 7:45, but we found that the location of the movie and the time of the movie changed day to day; and people were not able to tell is the name of the movie that they were going to show. This was frustrating for planning purposes. We shared this frustration, and were left custom schedule (made out just for us) and the week's movie, time and location.

While I did not go to the spa, I had a massage by the pool and the beach. It was absolutely dreamy. Lauren and Ed at Scotty's Dive Shop were amazing (see my separate review).

This was the best resort we have ever stayed at, and I'm already trying to figure out how to go again. Seriously, it was amazing.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Stayed here for 5 nights in December. In summary:

Rooms: Dated and with visible wear & tear visible on fixtures and fittings. Point in case: The room loudspeaker still has an iphone 4 adapter...nice touch, but obsolete to 99% of guests.

Service: great service, be it the complimentary speedboat service to and from the airport, the poolside waiting or the restaurants. Impeccable each time, and well-staffed.

Grounds: absolutely beautiful and beautifully kept - lush, well-designed and just great feeling. It also has couple of private beaches, both of which are very pretty and calm. We used the in-house dive centre to book dives and watersports activities. The service and gear provided were top-notch in all cases.
We were happy with the range of facilities: pool area, spa, fitness room, entertainment area etc etc cater for wide range of interests.

I would still return to the hotel but it would be highly unlikely i would return to the italian restaurant on property.",Food:Staff

"My husband and I came for a our 32nd wedding anniversary looking forward to getting away from the city and enjoying each other and the ocean. On the first two nights there were wedding parties on the beach directly beneath our room. It was incredibly loud and we were unable to even have a conversation on our balcony. We did call down to guest services. The Manager came to speak with us on the third day, apologized and did try to make things right. We explained that had we just known ahead of time, we would have adjusted our plans.
If you book a sea view room I would highly recommend asking about party bookings. It is quite a beautiful and popular wedding destination. The resort offers frequent complementary shuttle service down to D'Mall which is what we did on the fourth night while the party was going on (the Manager warned us ahead of time) and it worked out great.
Overall we did have a wonderful time, the facility is beautiful and the staff are amazing. A highlight was Franz at the beach bar, I never did see him without a smile on his face. Everywhere we went someone was ready to assist.
We weren't blown away by the food but did enjoy the ambiance and the wonderful service.
We had decided never to come back after the first two days but by the end of our stay we were completely won over by the resort, the beach and the community. We will definitely stay at Shangri-La if we return to Boracay, which we very much hope to do.",Staff:Food

"Amazing resort!!! Just getting here is already an experience of its own.
We had to wait for the speedboat when we landed but the 'waiting hut' is so pleasant already that it totally did not bother us that we were a little delayed getting to the hotel.
The hotel is amazing, very relaxed atmosphere. ALL staff members are so friendly, so happy and so helpful that it just helps to enjoy it even more.
Breakfast is absolutely amazing! The choices are endless and I mean endless and the food is delicious too.
The room we had was large and had a little balcony with amazing views of the gardens and the sea.
Spa is something out of this world and we have been to a fair few but this is one of the best ones! For starters - you get a whole hut to yourself if you are going for a couples massage. It is stunning and the variety of the treatments is great too. If you are visiting make sure you book a treatment as it is really worth it.
My husband also enjoyed diving whilst we were there and would absolutely recommend.

The breakfast buffet was excellent and had a good variety to suit all appetites. There were 2 beaches to choose from: one a private beach exclusive to the resort and a public one shared with others. Exploring both entailed a good walk. Even if it rained most of the time during our stay, we still enjoyed the places we ate at, the swimming pool, the beach, and our walks around the resort. We didn't even take the available shuttle to D'mall in Station 2, the main commercial part of Boracay. We just happily stayed in the resort.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"It’s been 2 weeks since me and my family got back from a 2 night stay at Shangri-la Boracay and our heads are still in the clouds. Our stay has been unforgettable and one that we will look back with fondness for the rest of our lives.

Pardon me for the long review...

Pros:
- The place is picture perfect. The rooms, the villas, the resort grounds look and feel luxurious, none of that minimalistic look that most hotels are leaning towards nowadays. From the view of the resort from our boat, the view of the sea from our room, the view of the beach from the Solana bar, it seems like the whole resort was designed to look stunning and inspire awe.
- Service was impeccable. From the guy at the shuttle stop near D’Mall, to the buggy drivers, to the restaurant staff, to the staff manning the counter at the lobby , everyone was ready and happy to assist. Everywhere you go you are greeted with a smile by the resort staff. You can feel that the staff have an air of pride in their resort and an enthusiasm in their work. You hardly see that anywhere else. Kudos to the staff and management.
- Kids love the recreation center. Air hockey, arcade basketball, pingpong, billiards, board games, movie nights, all unlimited and free of charge. How do you beat that?
- The swimming pools are really stunning but those gorgeous beaches beckon like a moth to a flame. Crystal clear water. No garbage or seaweeds. No boats cluttering the view. No hawkers. No crowds even when the resort was fully booked. The sand is not perfect and there are some rough patches so do take some precautions. Others may prefer staying at a villa or tree house but these are far away from the beaches. Our room (Premier Seaview Timog complex) is just an elevator ride away from the sand. How cool is that?
- Private speedboat to their own jetty. Must have for any luxury resort.
- Wifi was pretty good even at the beach.

Cons:
- The place is not that huge but getting from one point to another might require a buggy ride. Buggies are pretty busy at certain times of the day so expect to wait a while. Maybe there’s not enough of them? I didn’t see that many buggies during our stay.
- The place is a twenty minute shuttle ride from the Station 2. Not that convenient if you need to buy something and need to be back in a flash. Hopefully they will add an additional stop at Citymall (once it opens) to their route.
- After spending the morning at the beach, it’s pretty much a hassle to go to station 2 for lunch, come back to the resort, swim again during the afternoon, and then head out to station 2 again for dinner. We were at the resort for 3 days and we dined at Vintana 4 times (including breakfast). Food options are pricey and limited especially during lunch time. Only Vintana (coffee shop) and Cielo (pool bar) are open for lunch. I don’t understand why Sirena and Rima only open starting 6pm. Seems like a waste of perfectly good dining venues. Not enough lunch patrons, maybe?
- Food quality at Vintana does not justify the price. We were there during Halloween weekend. The restaurant was offering a pricey Halloween-themed buffet. We appreciate the effort and the decorations but the food was nothing to rave about. The breakfast buffets were nothing out of the ordinary too. There is a standard we have come to expect from buffets at a Shangri-la hotel restaurant and, sadly, we feel they didn’t meet our expectations. We would have loved to try fine dining at Rima but they were fully booked.
- Expect noise if your room is anywhere near where the beach weddings are held.
- Maybe provide additional open showers where people can wash the sand off their shoes / flip flops? Right now, people staying at the Timog complex just walk straight from the beach to their room and drip sand and water all over the elevator.

We didn’t get to try their spa or their dive center so I can’t comment on those.

Someone suggested that, on our next trip to Boracay, we try the other resorts along station 1 . No way. I can’t think of staying anywhere else but Shangri-la Boracay. The resort has set a pretty high bar that can’t be beat. Anywhere we stay in the future will always be compared to the paradise that is the Shangri-la Boracay Resort. We can’t wait to go back.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Shangri-la has always been the most prominent resort in Boracay. I happened to have an opportunity to stay here as a gift after we got married in Boracay White Beach. With expectations way up high, Shangri-La still managed to exceed that expectations of mine till the skies above. This resort is paradise. No flaws at all. All the things you need and don't need are just there prepared for you.

"The experience starts as soon as you arrive at the airport. The hotel shuttle arrives and upon entering, you are engulfed in the scent of spa-like lavender! The shuttle then drops you off at a luxurious waiting area where you are greeted with cold towels to freshen up and offered flavored water or coffee until the speed boat arrives to take you to your destination approximately 25 minutes away. The Shangri-La is located on the opposite side of the island on a secluded white sand private beach. Upon arrival, we were greeted by our private butler at the hotel entrance who quickly whisked us away to our room in a golf buggy. Upon entering our tree villa, we gasped at the size and luxury. The Villa was two stories of paradise! The first floor opened to the bedroom and a view overlooking the ocean and tree tops. The bathroom had a large Jacuzzi tub with panoramic windows and a separate glass shower. There were two vanity sinks and a separate water closet. The dressing area had two clothes closets and vanity desk. The second floor was huge. It also boasted panoramic views of the ocean, its own half bath, a kitchenette, a dining area, and balcony with a Jacuzzi tub and lounging chairs. We were given a personal cellphone to reach the butler on-call at anytime. The property is large but worth a walk, so comfortable shoes are a necessity. We forgot a few essentials, but the hotel gift shop thankfully was well supplied. Breakfast every morning was vast and buffet style. They offered Japanese, American, Chinese, Filipino, and Korean choices. Wait staff were courteous and prompt with orders. There is a hotel shuttle that leaves every hour to the popular Boracay strip known as D'Mall approximately 20 minute ride away. They were on time, each time we ventured into the city. We just happen to arrive the day of monsoon and quickly realized that this hotel had something for everyone. The indoor game room had full bar, karaoke rooms, pool tables, books, board games, basketball hoops, air hockey, and table tennis to kill time. We also took advantage of room service. This blew our minds. The golf cart arrived with a gentleman carrying a hot box and a large picnic basket. He hauled it to the second floor dining area and set our table. He then opened the large basket that contained our bottle of wine and wine chiller, linens, fresh plates and utensils, bread basket, salads, all anticipated condiments. Then he removed our entrees from the hot box which were piping hot! Very impressive. The food at the on-property restaurants would rival most in large cities in taste and quality...and if you love champagne, Perrier Jouet and Veuve Cliquot are the house pours! I could go on and on but I think you get the idea. This place is paradise and luxury rolled into one. This is one of the best hotels we have experienced. We would definitely return when visiting Boracay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Absolutely fell in love with the two beaches of this resort. Once is ""public"" meaning the large cove is shared with other resorts although the Shangri-la section is expansive. The other cove is private and by the Shang's large pools (yes, it has a main one and some sub-pools although I never got into those). On the long holiday weekend we were here both beaches seemed to have few patrons even though the resort was full, judging from the crowds and queues at the buffet breakfast in the mornings. So one does get privacy here.

To me everything else is frills to the outstanding beach, but neither do those supporting acts disappoint. The speedboat service is a real convenience as compared to the normal means to get from Caticlan to other Boracay resorts.

The rooms are quite a walk from the beaches, though not bad. They do have golf carts running around for the more spoiled guests.

I would come back even if this resort is expensive.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"As always Shangri-la experience is paradise. I've been to the different Shangri-la in the Philippines but so far this is the best service, we had (not that others were not but this was beyond).
Better to really enjoy the resort for 3-4 days and just enjoy the relaxing mode of the resort.
We were booked on the premier sea view rooms that had a view of the beach and at night we can hear the waves from the balcony.
The moment we got in Caticlan we were jetted off in the private speed boats of Shangri-la and was met by staffs with those island drum rolls, noting all guests arriving in the Shang jetty are welcomed by those drum beats.
We were then whisked with our own buggy, note anytime anywhere in the resort you can call for a buggy.
Our room was spacious with separate shower and bath and tub and just a relaxing balcony view.
The resort offer several restaurants we can choose from and even an equally elegant, romantic room service can be set up.
All through out our stay we never really went out of the resort except to play golf during mornings that was arranged by the concierge, we were either hanging out at the Cielo or Alon Bar and lounge and swim in the private beach or the heavenly swimming pools. One thing for sure though was that the resort staffs would have that inclusiveness of knowing your name, and this reminds me a lot of the resorts in Anguilla (another story) and what you like to drink and even your favorite spot.
Wherever we go, the staff knows us when we move to another sunset bar on top of the cliff called Solana it was just so great hanging out especially on sunsets.
We also had a great time feasting in Rima at top of the cliff and the Sirena that offers fresh seafood catch.
But one must not leave without trying the Chi Spa, this resort has one of the best Chi Spa village.

As always the stay in Shang was amazing, it's pretty hard to compare but the service and the peacefulness you feel is the Shangri-la experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"If you decide to take a trip to Boracay, make sure to avoid any connecting flights! You would waste valuable time transiting from Terminal 2 at Manila Int'l airport to their domestic airport at Terminal 3. Also bear in mind another 1 1/2 hour car ride from Kalibo Airport to the speedboat area and another good old 20 mins speedboat ride to the Hotel! Basically, you waste a good full day to get there. Thank god, the Boracay Shangri-la is a beautiful resort and we did enjoy out stay overall.",Location
"I stayed 6 nights at this resort over Easter 2016. We travelled with an almost three year old and stayed in a beach villa. Our experience was fabulous. Villa was rustic yet sophisticated and offered us the perfect family space.
The activities on offer at the resort were brilliant , meaning our little one was kept very busy and was a happy little camper.
The vibe and entertainment in the evenings also made it hard to leave the resort.
The beach was hands down the cleanest I'd come across in Asia. Truly a spectacular destination and great resort.
The manager made our visit very personable and warm. We will most definitely return.",Location
"Stayed here for 3d/2n with my fiance. From the moment we landed in Caticlan, the service was just phenomenal. Even though it was just the 2 of us that arrived, they transferred us via van and speedboat to the resort without any issues. As we docked, we were greeted by the staff and got on a buggy to be transferred to the concierge. The main lobby was absolutely beautiful. Mike from the concierge efficiently walked us through the check in process. Everything in the room was just top spec. I didnt have to bring out any of our toiletries as the ones in the room are quality. We also had treatments done in chi spa which took around 3 hours all in all. Everything was done in 1 villa, you dont have to worry about bumping into anyone else as you traipse to the shower to wash yourself. I would recommend trying out the spa to any couple. Proceeded to eat at Sirena restaurant. This would suit any seafood lovers out there, for those with a more european/western taste, I would suggest Rima restaurant. Walking to and from the restaurants wouldnt hurt either. Sirena in itself is lovely. You have a fire pit in the middle and a choice seating of outdoor and indoor. If the weather isnt too hot, sit outdoors. Dont worry about bugs, theres isnt any. Just enjoy the food and bask in the beauty of the surroundings. My fiance said its been the most relaxing vacation he's had (and thats high praise coming from an english northerner) A massive thank you to the staff of Boracay, Dandy at the airport arrival, Mike at the concierge, April from the lobby lounge and the ever helpful ladies from guest services. Thank you for making our vacation ever the more memorable.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Traveled to Boracay for the first time and thrilled to stay at this high end, beautiful resort. Service was impeccable- from the airport transfers to the speedboat, to check in, to restaurant and housekeeping.
This resort is akin with the Ritz /Four Seasons brand. Location was beautiful & secluded and clean. The beaches and pool were gorgeous. Rooms were well appointed and luxurious. Breakfast buffet had variety and was delicious. Maybe have more healthier options .
We were sad to leave paradise ... but will surely return. When visiting Boracay, this is my go-to place. Highly recommend.",Food:Location
"I spent 4 days and 3 nights with my family for the weekend of my birthday (14th-17th Oct).

What we loved:

- The lovely view from our Premier Sea View room facing Punta Bunga beach (Room 640), the bed was comfy and huge, I especially loved the day beds in the verandah
- The very friendly and efficient service from airport arrival to boat transfer to reception was seamless. I most especially liked that they suggested food for takeout on the way to the hotel. Nicky, the Korean receptionist who welcomed us and processed our check-in was very accommodating and pleasant. We even got the room upgrade that was included (but not guaranteed) in our booking.
- The breakfast buffet had plenty of selection, also the staff there were all very nice and friendly
- Solana bar staff, and most especially the band, were very friendly and helpful. They were very patient with my four-year old daughter. We went there twice for drinks before dinner at Sirena Restaurant
- Sirena Restaurant was a bit overpriced but the food and service were impeccable
- It was nice that they sent a cake and balloons to our room on the evening of my birthday and also gave me another one at Sirena Restaurant as an after-dinner treat
- The swimming pools were salt chlorinated, which I really liked
- The private beach areas were kept clean and service is always prompt and friendly
- The very helpful staff at the shuttle service for D'Mall was very nice to get us our own car when we didn't manage to fit in the van and we were bit late for the schedule

What we didn't like:
- I called guest service while I was at our room to try to find an item I left at the beach area but they never got back to me
- They seemed to have forgotten to book our van for Kalibo because all the others in the boat with us had their vans ready to go when we arrived at the lounge in Caticlan port. And then they gave us a van that was not as good as the one that we got upon arrival. Also, the driver seemed grumpy and unfriendly
- The room could use some improvements

All in all, it was still one of the best resorts I have ever been to. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to escape the pollution at White Beach, and to experience the best of Boracay.",Staff:Food
"I visited the Boracay Shangri La with family.
Having been to a couple of luxury resorts in my time, this was another level however, as was the price.

It truly does have every thing you pay for. The scenery, the service, the private jet pick up form the air port, the buffet breakfast with more food than you can handle, the most pristine beaches and gorgeous scenery.

On top of that, they had a diving centre a play centre for kids, shops, a hair salon and even an on site doctor. There was no reason to leave the resort if you didn't want to.

I loved that they provided a golf buggy service to assist you to move around the resort (as there are some hills on the walk).

You will love your stay here. There was no fault!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"It was an amazing experience over-all. From the front office team Enzo who's on point with his problem handling. he offered outstanding problem resolution and recovery. Vina from Solana and Myra from Vintana who provided outstanding service. My partner and i felt very much welcome on our first & last night (respectively) with their food & wine suggestions. Thei smile makes us feel at home. the housekeeping team Dyna and Grace for cleaning our room spotless... Oh, the mangoes are just so noms! Thank you Myk from amenity for the anniversary cake and the entire guest relations team for taking the time to each write their personal greetings. We sincerely appreciate it. Most especially, the in-room dining team for taking care of our food for the 2 nights we were ill. We will definitely come back to this property again.",Staff:Food
"We stayed at Shangrila for a week.
Every everything was perfect. Our room was spacious and wide with a beautiful balcony looking at the gardens.
The bathroom was huge and you wouldn't wanna leave.
The place itself was amazingly decorated, staff we're really friendly and helpful.
Breakfast was incredible and outstanding.
The pools, the privet beach, the bars and view points, the amazing spa, all beautiful and charming.

1 thing was unfortunately not as good as we anticipated - It was the Italian restaurant. The view's were gorgeous but the food not as much. The place is in Desperate Needs for a different chef !
Either then that the hotel was breathtaking from pickup to drop off at port.
We would love to be back anytime of the year ❤️❤️❤️",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I loved everything about the hotel. It certainly deserves it #1 hotel in boracay spot. From arrival to departure we were well taken cared of. The room was clean and spacious. The amenities complete. But what I really appreciated was the staff. They really went above and beyond. From booking our activities, to our last minute requests they made everything so easy for us. We were there to celebrate my dad's birthday and it was perfect. We didnt even need to go out of the hotel to enjoy ourselves. We had dinner at sirena their restaurant, and my family loved the food and again, the staff accommodated our request in preparing for a birthday cake. The hotel is perfect for those who wants to get their r&r.",Staff:Food
"Brought my family for my daughter's first birthday and happy to have made the trip!

It seems like there's a script to make you feel special. Starting from the team who received us at the airport, to the port lounge and speed boat, the welcoming team up to the time we checked out and left.

Minute details were also good. We especially liked the birthday treat given to us (loved the cake and balloons!). The baby items we asked when we reserved months ago were all there. The pool and beach staff, buggy drivers were really helpful. Also commendable is your hiring a deaf/mute man as one your staff.

It's unfortunate we were not able to try out restaurants other than Vintana. The one which specializes in seafood apparently needs prior reservation (no more tables available; had to wait til 9PM).

Even if the sun is not up all the time, just staying at the room and watching over the beach is relaxing. Wasn't able to catch the sunset because of the gathering clouds, though. Would have drooled over it while dipping in the pool or the nearby beach.

It's my wife's and mother's first time in Boracay and surely they'll remember the place as paradise. Thumbs up for this team! You got a loyal guest here.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Room, amenities, service, everything was great! The place was beautiful! Only thing I didn't like was their transfers. When we were transferring to another hotel in station 1, the driver didn't know that we were to be dropped off at a certain hotel in station 1. So instead, we were brought to D Mall. We asked if he was told that we were to be dropped off to our next hotel in station 1, and he said he wasn't informed about that. But my wife communicated all those information clearly even before we were on a plane to Boracay. Also, on our departure, we were told that we had to leave the island by 10am. But our flight was still at 4:15pm. It was just too early to leave at that time. Also they could have told us that they were dropping us off at another docking station. We were embarrassed to tell the driver of our van to pick us up at another location when he was already there at the main docking area of Shangri-La.

Aside from all that, our stay was great. Really relaxing. The people were very polite and proactive in helping us - my wife, my 1-year old kid, and even our helper with anything they can offer to make our stay relaxing. Just ready those tips though. Lots of ém. :)",Staff
"Even though we went to visit during the rainy season, our experience with the resort was definitely top notch. Everyone from the welcoming staff to the waitstaff to the bell staff and, especially, our butler went above and beyond in ensuring that our requests were met and that we were well cared for. The property was picturesque and the private villa was a nice retreat from busy life. Not cheap but definitely worth the splurge.",Staff:Value for money
"We returned to this secluded spot called Shangri-La Boracay through whirling winds, sheets of torrential rain inter-laced with patches of sunshine. The ambivalence of the weather proved no match to the warmth and gentility of the welcome we received from GM Esther and her staff. It was like a homecoming of sorts though at times it felt like we had never left. The ambience and spectacular view from our pool villa immediately banished all desires to be anywhere or do anything else. Kudos also go to Villa Manager Lazarus, his able second Sunny, Butler Ryan, Areis and Joel who went over and beyond to make this Shangri-La experience lovelier the second time around .",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"This was the first time staying at Shangri La Boracay for both my wife and I. We were there for 7 nights while travelling with my daughter and her boyfriend. We have been to Boracay previously staying on White Beach the last time.

First of all the transfer from the airport was seamless. My wife generally hates boats and suffers terribly from sea sickness. She was smiling the whole way across.

We had booked a suite and were originally given one at the end of the buildings away from the reception area. This is quite a walk to go to breakfast so I requested to be moved closer. This they did and we were pleased that they were able to react. My daughter stayed in a Deluxe room which was also very good.

The décor of the hotel is slightly dated but it is still luxurious. The grounds are very well kept and the pool areas are great.

I was not so impressed with the food. The breakfasts were good however the times we dined at night I found it to be over priced for what it was and the quality was not that great. I would look at dining out for night time. The day time quick meals and snacks around the pool were very good.

While the hotel is out of the busy centre of Boracay, transport to and from the main shopping and dining areas is very easy. You can either use the hotel vans or just catch a tricycle which are cheap. Always check the price before taking off. Most drivers are good but you will get the occasional one which will try to rip you off.

The beach areas are excellent. Punta Bunga beach which is the semi-private area has fantastic snorkelling and is very safe if you have young children. This was one of the best beaches I have ever been on. It is significantly more attractive and interesting than White Beach which is really just a long strip of powdery sand.

I can also recommend one of the 3 hour snorkelling trips organised through the hotel.

We spent the last two night up in a 2 storey Treehouse Villa. The views from these are incredible. While they are away from the water it is a simple golf buggy ride down to the beach. If there is not much difference in price between a suite and a Tree House Villa, I recommend paying for the Villa.

I cannot finish without mentioning two of the staff during our stay. Laudito who looked after us around the pool area, especially my daughter and her boyfriend. Great fun and very attentive. Sonny, one of the managers who was able to resolve an issue we had with a great degree of professionalism and made us feel we were valued guests.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and while it was not perfect I would not stay anywhere else in Boracay.",Food:Location
"We were WOWed in the entire stay! Service was excellent. Upon arrival we were welcomed in the Exclusive lounge and picked up by pristine condition white speed boat. We got to savour the tropical beach scenery on our way to the main hotel. As soon as we have arrived to the hotel, we were really excited to go see the places in the hotel. We visited the Chi Spa, Zenith was very gracious to take photos of our group while we were there. She even offered us tea and cold towels. Her service was remarkable.

The room was amazing, the food choices were delectable and service was EXCELLENT! I will look forward for this kind of R&R here again soon!",Staff:Food

"This is my 64th reviews, and this the only second 5 star Excellent I rated.

Every hotels or Resorts has their Bad and Good Services, stayed here for 5 days and these are all my experiences.

When I just arrived at Kalibo Airport, there's a Shangri-la Staff already waiting to pick you up. The journey took around an hour and the half to reach the jetty, and ""yes"" they have their on jetty spot, boat and a indoor waiting area fill with refreshments and wash rooms.

The distance from the jetty to the resort is around 10 to 15 minutes. Buggy ride is already standby for our arrival to bring us to Lobby Lounge for checking in. While on the way there, they will kindly brief us where we're and what place is this.

Upon check in, this staff Manielle ( I forgotten how to spell her name, sorry about that) gave us a excellent service, refreshment and brought us to our room.

When we reach our room, is not what we expected but I would like the management to fix this, we found an faulty lamp that is beside our bed, it is unplug, but when we plug it in, the lamp started blinking. Secondly, there's a hair in our bath tub.

While in the evening, we're planning to go to d'mall, they giving free shuttle van to d'mall, but we were lost, we can't find the shuttle, without asking anyone, one of the staff just appeared no where to assist us, we were surprise that they're really helpful. Is very rare to find hotel or resort with these services nowadays. Every where we explore in the resort we were greeted.

What WoW me the most is, on my birthday, I was outside doing some activities from morning till afternoon, we were exhausted, but when we reach back to our rooms, there's balloon, cake, and a birthday card from Shangri-la. I was shock and thrilled, I would like to thanks for the staffs that prepared for me, and I would like to thanks Nicky too from GRO for the Resort Tour.

When we found out there's an entertainment room, we wanna check it out. We were having fun there, they have Wii, computers, pool or billiard, basket ball machine and etc. Some entertainment have charges and some are complimentary. But on the next day we wanted to go to the entertainment center again, but unfortunately they're having a cocktail buffet there. A buffet in a entertainment center ""really""? Well that really turn us down, but we went to the resort private beach to relax and forget about it.

Suggestions:
When we was waiting for the shuttle back to the resort, this staff named Glen, he was sweating and exhausted in the look of his face, but we saw him there most of the night but he never fails to smile, greet us and socialize with us. If it possible for the management to put on a fan, so that guests and staff get enjoy a bit of wind.

"Wow. One of the best 5* resort experiences for our daughter wedding

We came here for our daughters wedding and everything was just fantastic. The staff couldn't do enough for you, the food was divine and the backdrop was awesome more than just its 5 star amenities, which is truly luxurious, The resort itself is beautiful, pictures don’t do it justice the hotel and its surroundings are majestic.

The resort has everything available for you so you won’t really need to leave. A kids club that is enormous with great slides, so much to do, salon, entertainment centre.
Spa and their amazing huge infinity pool is just out of this world. We loved the personal seating/jacuzzi jets set around the pool With towels and iced water delivered as soon as we arrived
It was great to see the life Guards always watching, 5 always around the pool,there are 2 private beaches which are beautiful – lovely clear water (no algae early March) and great for swimming with comfortable beds/chairs
The Sunset’s are to die for,on our first day there were fire dances on the beach just at sunset we also had them for the wedding reception and they are fabulous

Every single Shangri-La Boracay staff member is very well organized and trained; the training of the staff is exceptional
They all smile and take care you have everything you need. Remembering names I have never seen so much attention to detail

Nicely located away from the main strip - there are two private beaches, several pools. Food, entertainment, bars, activities all excellent.
Free shuttle down to the main area of Boracay

We decided to travel from Sydney via Sinapore then Kalibo to avoid Manila and the small baggage allowance if going through Catacan especially as we were attending a wedding This was reasonably painless and took around 1 and 1/4 hrs private van drive from Kalibo airport to the jetty. From the moment you get off the plane, there's someone from the Shangri-la to welcome you, show you to the van and take care of the luggage with cold drinks waiting . Then a 15 minute speedboat ride and you are there. On the way back we just did this in reverse the van ride back got a little hairy not as careful driver Our granddaughter was a little car sick due to the bad driving
A Shangri-la staff member met us at the airport and guided us thought the crowded airport taking all our bags with another porter through the sercuity before we even had got through,a great help especially with the children
Another tip we didn’t know until checking out of the Hotel they informed us of the exit tax you have to pay to make sure we had enough cash left,glad they told us as we did not know if you leave from Kalibo it is $700 pesos if you go through Catican as our daughter did they paid in Manilla and it was less not sure what she said it was

The breakfast buffet at Vintana is one of the best resort/hotel breakfast buffets in our years of travel. All the typical offerings in such abundance and variety including sushi, Indian, Thai, Philippino, cheeses, breads, cakes, to much to mention It is what you would have for breakfast lunch and dinner A Philippine specialty, the bibingka” do not miss trying this, it is a small - hot pancake thing in many varieties just delicious. Not to forget the ice-cream bar yes ice cream for breakfast the grand children were amazed to have ice-cream every morning for breakfast and the donut wall was another treat not the mention the smoothies they were just divine and staff remembered what we had from the day before and they were delivered to table no waiting to be made just such great service same with the eggs And for Coffee lovers they can make great coffee
As you can see I could go on and on about the breakfast

Our room was lovely just the standard room our daughter and Son-in-law had a tree top villa as part of the wedding package and that was a to die for view and room
Our room amenities were lovely, the linen and towels soft and fluffy, bed divine and fresh fruit supplied was replenished daily a nice added jester

This is the best resort we have stayed at thus far! We felt really lucky to have such a wonderful experience.

The wedding was just amazing and the staff helped in too many ways to mention in organising a destination wedding for all to remember",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"This is definitely not a cheap place to stay in Boracay but it is worth every penny you pay for. The rooms are immaculate, the service was also great and the views are all you can imagine in a tropical holiday. The pool area is pretty huge and there's plenty of space to lounge around. The beach area is also clean and quiet and you won't find anyone (especially souvenir sellers, etc) interrupting your quiet time. My partner and I enjoyed the food choices in the resort, the breakfast deserves a special mention (so much choice, and there was so much mangoes for everybody). We also liked the shuttle that goes to the island proper, which makes it easy for everyone to get around Boracay. We would love to go back again in the future!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"I stayed here recently with my family, and this was my third time in Boracay but first time at Shangri-La. It was great to be taken care of as soon as we stepped off the plane in Caticlan - I had no prior knowledge that they had their own docking station and lounge (meaning you avoid the very crowded port that everyone else uses), and then a speedboat takes you directly to the resort itself.

As expected, the entire resort was incredibly luxurious and thanks to it's prime location, there were great views of the sunset every night. I saw another review below saying to choose seasons carefully but we stayed here in August (typically rainy season) and it didn't rain once.

The food at breakfast and at the various restaurants was top notch, so you never even really need to leave the resort as there's so much choice. Obviously one of the main attractions is the beach and pool area, which was perfectly quiet and relaxing during the day.

We went to Sirena bar a few times for the green tea mojitos and for the view of the sunsets, which are mesmerising and something that Boracay in general is famous for.

The buggies that take you around the resort were great, along with the regular shuttle buses to and from central Boracay. It was so luxurious and comfortable in the resort that we barely left it, other than a couple of times to eat out and drink.

Hopefully we'll be back again next year.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This is my 4x time in Shang Bora and every time is like my first time! From the moment their shuttle picks us up from the airport, to their own jetty port and speed boat, the facade that welcomes me when we get near the hotel makes me feel so excited! The welcome drinks that quench our thirst and the good food at Vintana Cafe replenishes my strength to start hitting the pool and the beach not wasting any time haha! My 3days 2nights stay was strategically planned already. Day1 stay at Banyugan Beach, day2 Go to white beach in the morning and have lunch then spend the rest of the afternoon at Punta Bunga Beach. I really enjoyed using the facilities there like the kayaks, paddle boards and the snorkeling! The sand, corals, fishes and the water was magical! Retiring in our room is always special with the well made comfortable bed, the tub for a hot soak to ease my sore body from doing so much walking and swimming. I also love the shower and their choices for organic soap, shampoo etc. They use to carry l'occitane before. I wanted to try the spa but it was so expansive. Day3 pool day! Beautiful, blue, mildly salted water infinity pools entice you to take lots of beautiful picture perfect shots. The staff are so courteous and very accommodating. Makes you feel really special and important. The bugs were up and about to bringing us to our destinations inside the hotel which made it easier for me to get to one point to another.

The rooms are beautifully decorated and clean, smelling of the scent that carried around the entire resort. The pool was out of this world and the frozen towels being handed out at regular intervals were not only refreshing, but served by the lovely staff with a smile. All the staff were friendly and attentive especially Dave at the pool bar and Ludito who served in the breakfast restaurant and on the pool bar also.

"Boracay is a place I always look forward to visiting, every year. Summer is always a good time but too crowded. The lean months are good but tides are quite strong. Anyway, there was a long weekend because of a holiday and we chanced upon a good airfare deal to and from Manila-Caticlan, so we booked Shangri La Boracay. It’s a family vacation and the kids were very excited. Of course, the horror story of flights getting cancelled or delayed is a different rant. So let it be.

It’s our first time in Shangri La Boracay. There were good reviews and true to what I’ve read, Shangri La Boracay is a paradise. The moment we stepped in into their lounge at the jetty port, there were cold towels, cold water and coffee for us. Would have been better if there were cookies too (smile)! The welcome drink at the resort as well was a thirst quencher. The buttler assigned to us was very accommodating and the rooms given to us (a premier seaview room and a suite) were well appointed, very clean and we’ve got all what we needed. Good pillows, clean linens, fluffy good grade towels, toiletries, slippers. I especially love the water bottles in the room (both distilled and sparkling water)!!! I forgot to ask if I can bring one home (wink!).

The buggy attendants were very accommodating and they were fast. The cast of welcoming drummers at the lobby were also the fire dancers at night. They were great in multi-tasking. The room attendants were fast and courteous. In room dining, you get it in less than 20minutes. They deliver fast.

The breakfast area, Vintana, offers quite a good range of selection. Of course, bacon and eggs were a hit and so was the “danggit”. You just have to ask and they’ll make one for you. The donut wall was a big-hit to my son. He loves that and so is the ice cream/candy station.

Alon Bar staff are very accommodating as well, and their pizzas are good!!! Happy hour (buy one take one) drinks, superb!!! Get their frozen margarita and caiprinha. Of course, don’t miss the mojito!!!

Solana/Sirena is a bit pricey and food selection is quite limited especially for the kids.

The beach is a given fact. You’re in Boracay. The swimming pool is good for wading even for toddlers. The kids really enjoyed. They provide life vests for really small kids. Lifeguards are attentive which should really be the case.

Wasn’t able to try: Chi Spa and Rima; Will do this next time when there’s more “ME” time.

Summary: Shangri La Boracay made it enjoyable for us!!! Salamat!!!

Lost and found: We forgot my son’s swimming trunks one evening in one of the pool beds, we reported it the following but they didn’t find it right away. No less than the resident manager emailed me that they found it 2 days after we left, and will be sent to our home. Really good service even after we’ve left! Kudos to all in SLB.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I've been to Boracay many times and have stayed at a variety of resorts both simple to luxurious. Although all were good to great, none really stood out in our minds. The last visit we wanted a try something new which would cater to all of our needs and provide us an experience that we truly would feel satisfied. The Shangri-La Boracay certainly did not disappoint and in reality it exceeded our expectations. If you want to stay in resort which provides superior service with excellent and tasty cuisine, all expansive facilities, second to none accommodations and an experience that you will always remember then the choice is an easy one.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed there for 10 nights during the Chinese New Year holiday early this year. Like other reviewers mentioned the whole arrival and check in process is flawless.

I will just highlight a few points here which I think is worth to mention:

1. If you can afford, pick a higher category room to enjoy the beautiful sceneries. We stayed at the Premium Seaview Suite. There is a jaccuzzi outside and you can enjoy it at your convenience by asking your butler to set it up for you whenever you want it.

2. Breakfast choices are great. Quality of food is good too. Except there were a few staff eg. egg station and noodles station were kind of rude to guests from China. I do not know why. But they should not discriminate any guests staying at Shangrila Boracay.

3. Shopping - there is in fact nothing much to shop. We went to D'Mall using the shuttle provided by the resort. Every frequent trip so no worries about that. And there is a dedicated station at D'Mall for resort guests while waiting for the shuttle to come. There is a market at D'Mall and you can basically get what you need at the mini market including beers.

4. We tried a few restaurants at D'Mall and nearby D'Mall. The conclusion is none of the restaurants can beat Shangrila Boracay's standard. I would strongly suggest you to eat at the resort since the price difference is not much. Must try Rima and Serena while you are at Shangrila Boracay. You will be amazed.

5. Excursions - Beware of using Scotty's Dive centre in Shangrila Boracay. We had a very unpleasant and scary experience with them for our parasailing. The price charged by Scotty's Dive Center is actually triple or at least double the price compare to providers outside (you can find many at the white beaches in front of D'Mall). The parasailing provider charged us more for the souvenir t shirts compare to other guests from other hotel. The provider for parasailing which Scotty's Dive centre engaged is called Diamond Watersport. I raised a question to Shangrila Boracay GM that they should actually give us a better price for souvenirs or photographs because we pay double/triple the price.

Generally all sports providers at Boracay has a mindset that guests from Shangrila Boracay are rich and they dun mind to pay more for anything! We don't mind to pay more because we do not need to queue, we have representative from Scotty's Dive centre to follow us and to make sure we are being treated well and safe.

The scariest part is one of the guys at Diamond Water Sports threaten us because we refused to purchase the t-shirt. He was in very rude manner which I can tell from the way he spoke to Scotty Dive Centre’s rep called Menchie. He was hot tempered and his body language show sign for a fight which was then kind of blocked by Menchie. This is one nightmare to us especially when we have kids following along.

So beware of this provider if you are going for parasailing. They were warned by Shangrila Boracay and Scotty's Dive Center for their inadequate business etiquette. I also received an apology letter from them.

6. The private beach at Shangrila Boracay is wonderful. Not a big beach but just nice to accommodate its guests. Services were good too.

7. We celebrated my husband's birthday at Serena. It was well arranged and they actually baked his favourite Jackfruit cake as his birthday cake. The room was decorated too and a bottle of wine was ready in the room for us. How nice!

Look no other resort but just Shangrila Boracay if you are here. They take care of you from the minute you arrived from the airport til you leave the resort.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay over a long weekend.The food, service, and top-notch personal attention were all outstanding! There was a minor glitch with the plumbing but that was attended immediately.

We appreciated how many people are involved in making our escape as wonderful as it was. Ester(GM), Russell(Resident Manager), Rogie, Chef Omar, and Lazurus checked in regularly with us to see how we were doing.

The food and beverage were outstanding everywhere (and every time) we ate! The breakfast at Vintana, lunch at Cielo and dinner at Sirena and Rima were all excellent! The grounds are beautiful and well-manicured, and we enjoyed our lounging time by the main pool.

At the poolside, a special thank you to:
Laudito, PJ, Ronnel, Dave, Iver, and Salvador. These gentlemen work very hard all day long and were always attentive to us and every guest relaxing around the pool! Outstanding Work!

Our Buggy Drivers:
Arnel braved the rain on Saturday night and waited for us to deliver us safely to Sirena. He also was our chauffer to Rima for dinner on Sunday. Jerome was also very patient waiting to deliver us from our villa for breakfast!

Dinner at Sirena:
Oh no! It rained so hard, but Cherry, Cheen, and Rence took excellent care of us and did not let the down pour get them down!

Breakfast at Vintana:
There are so so many staff serving up an incredible breakfast. Jerald kept our table tidy, clear of clutter, and was quick to return with coffee's and juices. Faith always had a bright smile to great us as we arrived each morning for breakfast.

Our Butler Vicente was splendid. A true gentlemen who was always polite and courteous.

Thank you to the entire Shangri La Boracay team (from the airport, arrivals, transfer boat, transfer vans, reception, grounds keeping, house keeping, maintenance, restaurant servers, life guards, and the many many more we never see, for truly allowing us to escape!).

All the best to you and the team. We look forward to seeing you again soon!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
This is a great adventure in the philippines. The only hotel with uncomparable service and paradise in the island of the philippines. Discover yourself endulge the experience of service and relaxation of this resort.,Staff
"My family and I stayed here for about 4 nights in August. Getting to Boracay is a little trip in itself. A flight to Manila. A short 1hour flight from Manila to Caticlan. Then a short bus ride to the coast where a speed boat will take you to Boracay. We arrived during a high wind/tide season and we had to take the speed boat to the other side of the island as opposed to going directly to the resort. This added about 25min to the total trip but nothing too bad. Once you arrive at Boracay airport, there is a Shangri-La rep who will guide you through and take you to the Shangri-La lounge by shuttle bus. Here you will wait for the speed boat. Depending on your flight, you may have to wait for others to join before they take you to the speed boat.
Once we arrived at the resort, someone will greet you and take you through the check-in process. They took us to our room first and we were able to complete the check-in process there which was nice. Our son had just celebrated a birthday so the room was decorated with some balloons, cookies and a cake with his name on it. A very nice touch especially as I did not mention anything to the hotel. Check-in was smooth and we were given a brief overview of all the facilities of the resort.
We were in a Premiere Family Ocean View Room which had 2 queen size beds. Room was more than adequate and had a nice balcony overlooking the ocean and beach area. Wifi in room was consistently good. Wifi also throughout the resort grounds.
The resort was very nice but the staff were extremely friendly which made our stay all the more pleasant. There are two private beaches that you can enjoy. The sand is not as fine as it is at Station 2 or 3 but the water is still beautiful and you don’t have anybody peddling anything to you. Much more relaxing. Unfortunately for us, this season the winds and wave breaks are quite strong and so we didn’t spend too much time in the ocean. And probably one of the reasons the private beach was essentially deserted. We spend most of our time by the salt water pool. The pool was great and there seemed to be enough deck chairs for everyone (I didn’t notice too many people wandering about looking for a place to settle). Lots of families by the pool so if you are looking for quiet, the beach might be a better option.
The breakfast buffet was excellent. A large selection of choices (both local and international).
We had a couple lunches and a dinner at the resort as well. Prices are reasonable for a resort but there are many other cheaper options available in town as well. There is a free shuttle between the resort and Station 2 (D’Mall area) where you can try other restaurants. If you have time, its worth a visit but you will be hit with the hustle and bustle of throngs of tourists looking for places to eat and drink and afterwards, you will be happy you can return to the calm and beauty of the Shangri-La resort.
Overall a great stay and very family friendly.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Too many great things have already been said about Shangri-la Boracay. There’s a reason for that: The resort is impeccable. From reservations to rooms; from dining to departure – perfect to a fault! Well-appointed rooms, great sea view, probably one of the best resort breakfasts there is, fast Internet (yes, fast anywhere in the resort!), and a most attentive staff. Our family of four strolled to the private white sand beach and within minutes and without demand, beach attendant Richard came with towels and glasses of ice water. At breakfast, I asked if they have a bibingka (rice cake) that has both cheese and salted egg, and the chef replied, “none but I can make you one”. I asked guest services at past midnight if I could have a boardroom set up at 9am next day and voila, it was ready. On our second night, we transferred from premier sea view to the sea view loft villa, and housekeeping managed it all. Fine, when you stay at a luxury resort, these are but a given. But during our three-day stay, the list of “delighting guests” goes on and on and on. Van driver Mel does not only know the road, but also organic farming and vermi-culture! Concierge and guest services staff were always ready with information. And details like notepad and a pen by the phone in the toilet; complimentary still and sparkling bottles of water; after-sun moisture in the room; etc. tell you that a lot of thinking has been put to making guests’ stay enjoyable and delightful. We’ll be back, for sure.",Food:Staff:Location
Very good experience everything was perfect i recommand it for everyone who visits boracay and the staff are helpful and very nice always smiling i had great moments with my husband and they surprised me for my birthday they made a small party in my room with all the team of mr yamat singing and whishing me best things,Staff
"I always consider staff service the most important everytime I stay in certain hotels.... Shangri-la Boracay has it or I can say they have it ALL. Service is beyond superb, facilities are amazing, the courtesy of their staff is heart warming. I'm still in the hotel now(aug21-23) but can't wait to give my praises until I checked out.
I have my own preference that other hotels consider everytime I stay on their property. It's my first time to stay in a Shangri-la hotel but Bulls Eye they just excedded my expectations. They just provided my room all the things beyond our needs for a comfortable stay.
The moment I stepped in and greeted Welcome to Paradise. I know I am in paradise. The sincerity of their staff to served their guests is excellent. Special mention to Mariel of House-keeping and Rica of Vintana Cafe. The service you provided us will always be my basis on how excellent customer should be delivered to hotel guests.

"We upgraded to a higher level room overlooking the ocean. Boracay was the last destination on our 2 week Philippine itinerary. And boy were we pleased! The Vietnamese spring rolls at their restaurant (Vintana Cafe) are absolutely the best - we ordered them at every lunch we had there. The manager Keith took special care of us. The service was impeccable, and Chi the Spa was one of the best spas we've ever been to. A dinner at Rima was exquisite and the punta bunga beach was awesome. We will surely be back, if nothing else for the Vietnamese rolls - which were to die for! The pool was fabulous as well.",Staff:Food:Location
"My review will not do this jewel of a hotel justice, so apologies. From our arrival at reception when Rose looked after us , to the minute we left, we felt like millionaires. Rose is a true ambassador for the hotel. Every minute detail for taken care of. Enzo, the front office manager and all the staff will ensure your stay is so memorable. We opted for the private villa. the beach and sunset bar were absolutely epic. I wanted to extend our stay instead of our next destination but we couldn't cancel. We already planning our next stay here and also our wedding plans.

"We are presently enjoying the decadence and excellent service at this resort.

Located on a quiet side to the west of the island, it boasts its own quiet and secluded beach with clean white sands and good snorkelling.

The resort itself is beautifully laid out and the sea view family suite has every amenity we could ask for, not to mention a butler who assists us and answers all our queries.

The breakfast buffet is fantastic giving the guests the ability to sample breakfast from China, Japan, India/Pakistan, Philippines, continental Europe and the US. The same restaurant runs evening buffets with themes which at first sight didn't sound appealing. But the Indian/ Arabic buffet proved us wrong with an excellent selection of salads, grilled meats, mezes and biryani/kormas etc from the Middle East and south east Asia.

There is a dive centre and the resort offers snorkelling trips and other water sports. The costs for these services are higher than comparative services in town but in our view worth paying the extra if with a family of young kids. Snorkelling equipment is provided for all ages and in great condition. All the water sports equipment such as kayaks and sailing boats look new and in great condition.

The resort runs regular shuttle services to town which is really convenient. Decadent as it sounds, the resort also provides transport (bus and boat) for its guests from the airport which again takes all the stress out of the holiday.

There is also a kids entertainment centre with different sports activities such as table tennis, air hockey, pool tables and basket ball practice hoops. We also noted a games room with Wii players and there is a separate soft play room for younger kids.

Terrific place to spend quality time with family with every whim taken care off. We have never stayed at a shangrila before and recognise it is a rather pricy affair but if you are looking for a holiday of a life time that is peaceful and with all the facilities, this is the place to be.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We stayed for 5 nights and booked a villa with Infiniti pool at the hill on the resort. When arriving to the airport on a small island just next to Boracay, the concierge is already waiting for you outside the plane with a signage and your name. They take your luggage tags and get your suitcases for you. What a great service that is normally the most annoying thing on a vacation. You get then transferred to a small and well equipped arrival lounge at the jetty and can actually see Boracay just 500 meters away from you. A speedboat will bring you then directly to the resort which takes only 8 min. The resort is based at the end of the resort and super private. What a view when you arrive! The GM welcomes you at the jetty and offers you assistants during your stay. Wow what a service and professional approach. A buggy brings you then to your villa. What a villa in the hills on 2 floors. Bedroom and bath on the top floor and living room, kitchen, pool and terrace on the lower floor. What a wonderful view over the resort and what a sunset!!! We stayed every evening in the villa to watch the sunset and went then down for dinner. The hotel has a great variety of restaurants and an amazing spa which makes you feel like in heaven. There is shuttle bus rotating during the day to bring you down to the white beach and back. The food, service and friendliness of the staff was outstanding, we can't wait to get back!!!",Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Everything about the amenities. Your own beach no crowds. The service seems to be welcomed by everyone. The view breathtaking. If there is one thing lacking is the food as you have to eat 3 meals there unless you have to travel far to grab a snack on the other side of the island. Nevertheless its good. You can use the amenities as long as you can until you could get tired of using. Using the gym and pool is also excellent as there is lots to choose from. Jogging outside is challenging as you are subject to climbs and various routes. Children has lots of things to do with their adventure zone, although not as big as the one in Mactan. Wifi has good coverage al throughout.
Well the drawback is of course the price as its one of the most expensive we've been through. Not for every weekend jaunt. If you can afford, its like your private island.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities

From the greeting at the airport we were then bused to an exclusive Shangri-La lounge (towel/water) prior to our resort only passengers high-speed boat trip to the resort (located on the far side of Boaracay island)..
When we arrived at the jetty - collected and taken by buggy to the reception area (with refreshing juice while the resort amenties were explained)..
The highlights being:
- great exclusive beach;
- service from all (beach bar / room attendants / main dining room / restaurants) was just great;
- amazing buffet breakfast;
- food / drink selection fantastic..
- regular ""free"" shuttle service to Area B on Boracay to experience the local tourist area..
This was also coupled with a nightly fire-throwing show on the beach, many other activities and an superb seafood restaurant;

The resort is such you could just stay there and not worry about the rest of Boracay.. however we did need to experience it .. all services are at the resort .. and free or reasonably priced.

Just be careful with the flights out of Boracay .. often delayed due to delays in Manila - we waited 2.5 hrs and were offloaded to another flight back to Hong Kong ..

HOWEVER - we will definitely be back again.",Food:Location
"we stayed at tree-house villa, which has spectacular view. the villa itself also has a touch of filipino culture, which gives us exotic feeling. i was happy with rooms, and amenities there. also, most of the staffs are very kind and helping, always greeted us with smile. also shuttle to the d'mall was very convenient. overall i am very happy with my choice of coming and staying here.
a few minor things for future improvements
1. card transactions were not stable, which made us wait at the lobby longer than other guest. since we hadn't had lunch at that time, that time seemed like thousand years. better get system improvement.
2. jacuzzi at the villa was quite rusty, so we couldn't use it. later our butler could open a water tap, but still it should be opened easily with normal power. hope they can manage their facilities with more care.
3. as other people said, at the time of check-in, a staff tried to sell more expensive room. why don't they think i had known all the options available before making a choice? hope i can avoid this unnecessary conversation.

"Ok, this place is expensive and away from the main tourist area. But if you want a romantic getaway then this is your place.

The place is huge and the staff are extremely friendly and polite.

We spent a week and I must admit that was enough. We had a great semi-ocean view room on the 6th floor which was spacious and had a nice outside balcony. The airconditioning is great and in June you need it to escape the humidity.

While a bit away from town, they do have shuttles to and from the main area which operate till 1am. I think a lot of people head there for lunch and dinner as it was quite quiet most of the time.

We ate at all the restaurants and often had food at the pool area. The staff are super attentive and extremely polite.

The security guys are a bit scary at sometimes, but I guess that's their job.

Rima is their top of the line restaurant which was really nice. No airconditioning so hopefully you get a cool night.

We upgraded to the treetop villa just I time for the amazing sunset views (check out the photos) and weren't disappointed.

The buffet is great with always changing menus. By the end of it we were only have an omelette as you could eat till you dropped!

It's definitely worth a stay here, even if you can only do a few days. Well worth it!",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"While pricey, the resort is amazing. We stayed in the Deluxe Garden View Room, and while this is the most economical option, it's still an great choice, spacious with a private veranda with two day beds, a large bathroom with two sinks, a bathtub, and separate shower and toilet facilities.

Other than the pool, two pristine beaches with lifeguards on duty and the Chi Spa, they also offer several complimentary activities daily both for adults and for children.

The breakfast buffet selection is wide and the food excellent. You have four separate restaurant options for dinner, we dined in three of them, and all exceeded our expectations.

The service is also impeccable, formal yet friendly, the entire staff is really a joy to interact with. They go the extra mile to make sure your stay is as close to perfect as possible.

The breakfast well all I can say is one thing I have never seen a spread quite like this in my entire life you need to be really hungry, there is enough choice there to meet any taste and more. A few times we went to Dmall and the hotel has an excellent regular transport service that takes you to the mall and again has its own area to meet for the return journey to the hotel.

"I have been fortunate to visit the Shang in Boracay on a number of times and throughly enjoyed every visit. It is expensive but it is an amazing oasis to visit. Make sure you fly into Caticlan airport it is the quickest way to get to the island. Avoid kalibo airport, it is not Boracay and is a long way away from the island.",Location
"Stayed for 2 nights at a deluxe garden view room with friends. We availed of a promotion, which made our stay a real value for money.

The resort delivers what one would expect from Shangri-la: A beautiful place, this one a sprawling one with beach and pool; clean, comfortable, and big room; delicious food; warm and courteous service; and attention to detail. There's a lot of picture-worthy nooks and views.

There are many places to stay at Boracay, but I would recommend Shangri-la if you want privacy, a quiet place, a luxurious stay, a private jetty and transfer to and from airport. The last one is especially convenient for families with young kids.

If you want to be in the center of things, then stay at the resorts in White Beach. But Shang has shuttle every hour going to and from White Beach to the resort, so it's not really an inconvenience to be far. Travel time takes 10-15 minutes. We found coming back to the resort a comfort after spending time at the busy and bustling White Beach.

Food in Shang was excellent. We had dinner at their Sirena Restaurant that specializes in seafood, and the grilled food was so tasty and fresh! Breakfast at Vintana was always a treat, with many choices, all tasting great.

Service is warm and courteous, and when I asked for directions to the restaurant one time, the staff guided me all the way there.

The only hiccup was the arrival. Our group of guests had to wait for 30 minutes for the private boat. I was expecting only a short wait, at most 15 minutes, considering that they knew our arrival details ahead of time and the resort had more than 1 boat. It would have been nice if we had been ferried shortly to the resort, considering that most flights to Boracay arrive later than scheduled, and so guests are tired and impatient and eager to be at our paradise resort. There was also no advice when we would ride the boat.

Other than this, I would highly recommend Shangri-la if you want a relaxing, leisurely stay at Boracay. Go ahead, treat yourself!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We weren't suppose to visit this island due to our vacations itinerary. After visiting this outstanding resort that sits on two big sandy beaches, it was worth staying at. Upon arrival via boat, we were greeted at the lobby area with an island drink and fresh cool wet towels for our faces. I loved the views overlooking the ocean, beach and the resort's sprawling acreage! I admired being to walk all around and see parts of the resort's grounds without having to use a golf cart. There was another long stretched out beach which I checked out and it was really pretty. I loved all of the infinity pools! Every night there was a two or three person small band playing on the beach or next to the pool, which our family very much enjoyed! We entertained by fire dancers during our stay, which reminded me exactly of Hawaii! All of us excluding my dad went in the ocean. Water was very warm. We needed to wear life jackets for safety reasons, which is understandable. Good reminder for those visiting. We also enjoyed the continental morning breakfast inside the resort, having lunch at the beachside bar and enjoyed having nice dinners inside the resort. The resort's room was very comfortable. Having a few nights to sleep was well worth it! We couldn't take advantage of the outdoor balcony view but why..when we had access to the pools?!

"We stayed in shangri la for a wedding of a good friend of mine. The highlight of shangri la is that it offers privacy and exclusivity for the price you pay. The boat ride from Caticlan to the cove of shangri la Boracay is seamless, comfortable and easy.

The breakfast buffet is huge, and the choices are amazing... Problem with it is nothing is that great, but anything you want you can have... Eat once and your next meal can be a later afternoon snack.

Rooms, and service is typical shangri La good. ""5 star service "" since they are obviously charging you 5 star prices.

The main problem I have with Shangri la is actually what makes it desirable as well, the location. If you have been to Boracay over 10x already, then it makes sense to stay in shangri la at least once. But for me, I go to Boracay for the action and nightlife... And unfortunately, the location and distance of the shangri la from bars, restaurants and other friends is just too far and inconvenient.

"Stayed here in two sea-view rooms with my wife and daughter in April 2016. After a short flight from Manila, we were gathered up Shangdi-La's impeccable staff and whisked off to their private lounge at the quay, then on by large motorboat to the hotel. A fun welcome with noise and colour with a native dance at the jetty, then gold buggy up the hill to the reception. Here was one of two slips in an otherwise superb stay. The staff tried too hard to get us to upgrade our booking to a villa. First of all, when I booked online there were no villas available, so how did they miraculously become available - and at a higher price than was indicated online (!). We demurred but the check-in was spoiled by this rather cheap attempt to gouge us a few more dollars.

The five star rooms were very comfortable, with en-suite bathrooms, and private balconies with lovely sea-views. And I really doubt that any villa would have given us that.

Beach, loungers, massage, ocean - tried them all and first class they were. The beach bar boys were attentive, but maybe not enough. I almost had to run up semaphore signals to get attention some times.

Second uncomfortable moment came when I ordered the fish baked in salt. This is a classic dish when well executed - in the north of Spain the excel at this. Here, unfortunately the chef thought it was a good idea to serve the fish still wrapped in the salt. This made for one saline experience, and very unpleasant it was too. To modify me the head waiter offered free dessert, but then charged me on the bill. We left.

But my faith was restored the next day when the F&B manager tracked me down at breakfast, apologised profusely and offered a free bottle of wine for dinner that night. In the end I only had a glass, but the gesture was appreciated and of course - typical of Shangdi-La's high class hotelier fame. And dinner that night was also exquisite.

Verdict - we will be back. This is too good not to try again. But Shangri-La really...don't make the check-in experience so tacky. The other guys (the ones with the fans) would never stoop to this.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Family spent New Year in Shangrila Boracay.

We were rested and pampered in the villa and enjoyed welcoming 2016 in the beach.

The service is excellent, from the time we were picked up from the airport to the time we were brought back.

The location was away from the crowd but very accessible to where the action is.

The view of the sea from the villa gives one a sense of calm and peace.

The breakfast buffet had lots to offer. Eating was an experience in itself.

We decided the Shang will be our venue for a wedding in August.",Location:Food
"Last trip before summer ends.. Its gotta be worth while.. So we decided to go to our favorite place in boracay.. And it was spectacular, we cant ask for more.. We stayed in the tree house villa, it was very unique, relaxing and w/ a sweeping ocean view.. The Villa's great, (even have a butler service), we could spend the whole day in it since everything we need for relaxing was there, not to mention the upper floor's spacious living area with a Jacuzzi on the balcony..
But since the whole resort was a complete dream package.. We tried to explore almost all area of the resort and everything was beautiful..",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Made our stay an enjoyable one especially for the kids! The place was well kept and the staff are always on their toes offering assistance. Our girls loved the pool and kept coming back to it the entire stay. Rooms are clean and spacious including the bathroom! I also appreciate the fact that their van service to D-mall was very efficient. We went to the D-mall to grab food and stuff everyday during our stay and we never waited for more than 5 minutes for the van to arrive and pick us up. What made me really appreciate the hotel is the kind gesture that one of their staff showed to our daughter. We got a plate of cookies when we arrived as part of their welcome treats and my daughter loved them. The next day, the cleaning lady was in our room when we got back from swimming and I heard our daughter say to her that she wants more cookies because they were yummy. A few seconds after, the lady came back with a plate of cookie for my daughter. Very nice gesture!
Transfers were all arranged for and it was smooth. No hassle and very efficient staff.
We enjoyed our stay at the Shangri-la! This is one of our family vacations that our daughters will surely remember :)",Staff:Food
"I sent a mail asking one simple question: room availability during specified dates for rooms under the American Express card promo. The first reply has quite stressed me out already: it was a standard ""copy pasted"" reply about published room rates, hotel services, etc. To give them the benefit of the doubt, I told them I don't think the answers were right. So they came back with another standard reply: promo is on for Mastercard and a bunch of promo details. So in both replies, I didn't get the simple answer that I was hoping for.
When people plan a short vacation, everything should be insync'd: flight and hotel availability. That's the whole point of the query: room availability on specified dates for rooms under Amex promo. I don't know what part of that query they didn't understand. Hearing apologies a lot times makes me think that people use that as an excuse for their laziness, ignorance, or sheer incompetence. I don't expect that from Shangri-La staff.
I'm now deciding whether to push thru with the reservation (and deal with staff that will only stress me out further) or consider an alternative resort (Discovery Shores) and hope for the best. Maybe drop Boracay all together and go to Palawan instead (where I haven't been stressed out booking rooms in the past). Resorts should know by now that their frontliners (reservation and front office) can be deal breakers.,

P.S. Went the El NIdo Lagen and Pangulasian resorts instead. Never had the same problem making reservations.",Staff:Value for money
"There are 2 airports in Boracay, One in Calticlan (20mins to the port) and Kalibo (2hours to the port). To get to this resort, you have to take a boat ride from the port, which takes about 30mins.

Upon arrival, we were greeted with a local traditional band and the check in formalities were done in the room.

This resort is situated along an array of other hotels and there are plenty of water sports available all day.

The food is excellent, go for the local dishes. At night, theres a buffet served by the beach. While feasting, there will be fire performers and live band.

There are also many private villas available, cant wait to visit this resort again.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Quick side trip to Boracay after a business trip to Manila and I chose to splurge on stay at Shangri-La because it has a private beach and away from the crowds. When you step off the plane, they are waiting for you when you pick up your luggage, then they take you in their van to an air-conditioned building for the boat transfer to the hotel. While you wait, you are served cold water and the staff is very friendly. The transfer is included in the room rate.

The boat ride is about 15 mins to Shangri-La and you pass by Station 1, 2, 3. You arrive on their dock with bell men waiting to take your luggage and they have buggy to take you to the reception area.

The check in time is 2 pm and there is a fee if you want to check in early (before 8 am, it’s 1 night’s charge) and (after 8 am, it’s 500 PHP). I went to the Health Club and changed into my swimsuit, went to the beach and then at 2 pm, was able to check in.

I booked the room directly on the Shangri-La website and got a promotion for 3 nights and 4th night free, in Premier Sea View room. My 4th floor room 425 was conveniently located near the lobby and had a beautiful view. There are 5 floors in the Timog buildings.

The room was spacious with comfortable King bed, DVD player, TV, sofa bed, desk, hot pot and mini refrigerator. The bathroom had dual sinks, tub, separate shower and toilet. There are 2 bottles of water per day, tea and fresh fruit daily. Free Wifi. Nice deck with table/chairs and lounge chair.

The room rate included the buffet breakfast at Vintana Cafe, which was fantastic ! Local fruit, pastries and breads, fresh squeezed juices, coffee, tea, sushi, meat and cheeses, gelato, eggs, omelets, porridge, noodles, soup, hot dishes. Paula was there to greet me every morning with a smile (we are Facebook friends now).

The Punta Bunga beach is the best beach (where the boat drops you off) and has lounge chairs and umbrellas. There is a life guard, towels, restroom, life jackets and snorkel equipment at no charge. The water is amazing and crystal clear. The beach food and drink service was lacking, but appreciated Willie and Mel with the snorkel equipment. The Banyugan Beach is smaller and the pool is here. Much more crowded and more action here.

You can walk down the beach a short way and there is a restaurant. I met Roel, who was dropping some people off at the restaurant in his boat and asked about an island tour boat trip. He gave me his card and told me to call him. Some hotel construction is going on down the beach.

Some friends were staying at a Station 1 hotel and they wanted go on the island boat trip, so I asked the concierge, Tristan (very helpful and friendly, we are also Facebook friends now) to call Roel. There was no answer, but he kept trying while we went to have drinks at the beach. When we came back, still no answer, but I asked him to try one more time and finally we contacted Roel to set up the trip for 3 people at 3,000 PHP total. This was a much better deal than the 3,000 per person trip the hotel could set up thru Scotty's.

There is a free hotel shuttle to D’Mall from 9 am to 1 am, leaving every hour. From 6:30 pm to 10:30, every 30 min. Roel met us at D’Mall at 10 am and we took the boat around the island with snorkel trip at Crocodile Island. This was the best snorkeling ever, with tons of colorful fish and crystal clear water, just fantastic ! At D’Mall, there is a Budget Mart mini grocery store for drinks, snacks, etc.

The resort Entertainment Center is large and has DVD disks that you can check out for free, ping pong, books, computers at no charge. There is a bar to purchase drinks and refreshments. The Health Club is beautiful and has sauna, steam, whirlpool, exercise equipment and daily classes like zumba, tai chi and yoga. On this level is also a beauty salon, store for toiletries, drinks, snacks, souvenirs, etc.

There is Chi Spa for arranging beach massage and other services and you get 10% discount for services on the first day. There is an ATM in the lobby and charges 200 PHP fee. You need 200 PHP cash when you return to the airport for the Terminal Fee.

Restaurants include Sirena for seafood dinner, Rima for romantic dinner, Cielo at poolside and Vintana Cafe for all day dining.

When I was there, there was a wedding almost every night on the Punta Bunga Beach below my room. It was noisy and one night, the music was so loud, it gave me a headache.

I got a late check out time 12 pm at no charge and if you want a late check out til 4 pm, the fee is 50% room rate, after 4 pm, it’s 1 night charge. You go back by boat to take the van to the airport. It’s 5 min by van once you get off the boat and they handle all the baggage for you.

The hotel is fantastic and outstanding service (except for one of the concierge). The view from my room was gorgeous and I recommend the Premier Sea View for the excellent view and sunsets. While the resort is very pricey, especially for Philippines, but I enjoyed my stay and the scenery is lovely. Ester Marcaida is the general manager.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food

I had the opportunity to visit this high end resort and was awed for a few hours and felt I must write a review on a place I would love to stay had I been able to afford the room.

Discovery Shore a close second but more for young tourist.,Location
"Stayed a week for our honeymoon. It was lovely!

From the Jetty, we took the speedboat so we skipped the hustle and bustle of the outside world. If you've been to Boracay, you'd know how hectic going to the island can be. They offered us cold drinks and let us cool off while waiting. I felt cared for at the very beginning and it was a great sign of wonderful service.

It didn't change. For the next few days, my husband and I enjoyed the wonderful breakfast served to us and immensely enjoyed the paradise. It is paradise with wonderful people that help you everywhere you go.

When you want to go to the White sand beach, there are vans to take you to D'Mall and there is a waiting area for Shangri-La guests there as well.

The room view is amazing. I fell in love with the place. We forgot to do water sports as there was a typhoon and weather was bad, but we enjoyed staying at the different beaches the resort can offer.

Firstly, this hotel is very family friendly. We brought our two young sons with us (aged 5 and 2) and they had a blast in the kids room.

The pools are divine and so is the private beach (we also went snorkelling around the rocks which was fun too).

The buffet breakfast is fit for a king and queen and tailors to everyone's needs.

"We had 4 days here following on from 4 days staying at Station 2. We found Shangri-La a peaceful oasis away from the constant badgering by hawkers. We preferred the semi private beach as it is more exposed so had a nicer sea breeze. After lunch we preferred the shade around the pool as the afternoon sun made the beach uncomfortably hot. Watching the sunset over the ocean while drinking a cocktail was always a nice experience. The staff were always very helpful with finding pool/beach lounges and meeting any food or drink requests. One minor area for improvement is the buggy system - we had a few occasions of calls not being answered at buggy stations or buggies not coming, so ended up walking.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

Rooms are specious and comfortable.
Amazing beaches - clean, with helpful staff. Very clean water but with corals - need to find spot without corals to go in.
As for the food I would not recommend any of the restaurant in the hotel.
In seafood restaurant waiter was describing fish as the freshest, ""just from the sea"". We ordered grilled fish and it was not fresh at all. You do not need to be an expert to feel the taste of rotten fish.
Salmon was also not fresh at all.
My daughter had not chewable fillet mignon from kids menu.
In order to our complain these items were excluded from the bill.
When you order wine or champaign by glass you won't get fare amount in your glass. It will alway be less then it should be. and this is obvious that they trying to save on this.
it is irritating as in 5 star hotel you expect 5 star service.

I can't say enough about this place. My happy place on earth.",Staff
"What can I say that hasn't been said before, gorgeous grounds and service is impeccable. It's the nicest resort on the island and you feel like you are in your own romantic world. The beaches and Swimming are much better here than the other beaches - no Hawkers! We stayed in a tree top villa which was great though in my opinion not sure if worse the dramatic price increase. Hot Tub was great but the living room isn't connected with the bedroom until you go outside which was a bit annoying and meant we just really didn't use the upstairs bit. Besides you are mostly out on the beach or in town anyways! I would recommend doing diving or parasailing activities through other vendors though - just do your research - it's really highly priced In the resort comparatively",

"I visited Asia for a month in March - April 2016 and kicked off my trip with a stay at the Shangri-La Boracay. I'm so glad I did!

Everything was perfect - from the private boat ride to the resort, to the Shangri-La's private beach, the food, beautiful sunset views, and terrific service was more than I expected. Moreover, I have stayed at several Shangri-La resorts throughout the world and I must say, the Chi Spa at Shangri-La Boracay exceeded all expectations. I had the use of a private spa villa during my treatment.

My room had a partial sea/partial garden view. It was large, with a king sized bed, a large luxurious bathroom, a private balcony with a table and lounge chairs. Of course, you probably won't be spending much time indoors.

The resort is large, particularly depending on where your room is situated, but the resort has buggy (golf cart) service available to anyone for purposes of getting around. I didn't have to wait long for my golf cart rides and was able to order them in advance of my departure from one place in the resort to another. To be on the safe side, order it about 5-10 minutes before you are ready to depart.

The site is fantastic with guaranteed discretion if this is what you are looking after.
Correct to say that food quality could be better at these prices but in the end you do not go to the other side of the world simply because you want to have fine dining.

But You have to be flexible on these trips so we paid and upgraded to one of the beach front villas. I have to admit I did not notice the robes or fridge door because we were too busy swimming/snorkelling/kayaking/sailing in this paradise. Yes it is far from the borocay action but in my view this is a blessing. Stations 1-3 are like Kuta Bali on steroids. It is a bit harsh to blame the hotel for coming in 7 hours late.

"We just came back from Boracay last week. It was our second stay there. It has a great location, just a short walk from the beautiful beach. And the entertaiment centre there is the best we've ever seen in the hotels. That's why we were happy to come back and bring some friends with us.
But this time we were very disappointed about a few things. Hope they can be fixed!!!
First of all - tennis courts!!!
We travelled a lot and most of the hotels never charge for using a tennis court. You only pay for the lesson. May be Shangri-La hotels have different rules. Back to Singapore I called Shangri-La here and they told me that court booking is 10$, In Boracay i paid 3 times more!! It's just ridiculous! We were told that we chose the best time 6-7pm, that's why it was so expensive. We had the worst experience playing tennis with such a bad lights. We could hardly see the ball. It was very disappointing!
Next, snorkeling trip. It was booked a day before. We asked to start at 9am. We had to fill the papers first (can be done the same day when we booked to save time) and then we waited for the buggy. We waited and waited. No buggy. Then one of my friends took the box with snorkeling equipment and started to carry it towards the beach. It was faster this way. The girls from the diving centre didn't let him and asked one of the staff to help. The buggy still didn't come. So we walked to the boat. If you prebooked a trip, why the buggy was not there at 9am??? It was very disappointing!
And finally our last dinner. Just disaster! We had a company of 13 people, kids included. When I booked a table, I was told that we had to preorder food!!! Ok, big company, they don't want us to wait long. So at 5pm I came to the lobby, with the list of food for all people. At 7pm we came to the restaurant Sirena. Kids food was served at 8.10pm!!! After we complained a few times about waiting. The staff apologised and we didn't pay for the dessert. But the last evening was spoiled. Why I was asked to preorder food? If we didn't , then how long to wait? Two hours? It was very disappointing !!",Food:Staff:Value for money
"We’d been looking forward to visiting Boracay for some years and decided to go via Kalibo to avoid a transfer in Manila. This was reasonably painless and took around 1.5 hrs to the jetty. 15 minute speedboat ride and you are there. Shangri-La is HUGE but doesn’t suffer because of it. Staying over Easter occupancy was full and it never seemed massively crowded. Rooms are fine, nothing special really but perfectly fine. The resort itself is beautiful, pictures don’t do it justice. Staff are warm and friendly. Lots of activities at the kids club for our 3 year old plus of course two lovely beaches (although don’t expect the talcum powder sand of white beach but then again you don’t have the crowds either!) Good resort style pools (although could be bigger really) Huge decent buffet breakfast is included too (although at the price you pay for the rooms I should hope so too) My 16 yr old daughter was also delighted with the excellent Wifi (also included) allowing her to stay glued to her iphone at all times without interruption to service…sigh. Spa was great with reasonably priced treatments. Only negatives are cost, it is very expensive and for that amount of money I would expect nicer rooms and better food. With the exception of Rima (this was first-rate) the restaurants were decidedly average. We stupidly signed up for the beach buffet on Easter Sunday, ridiculously overpriced for the quality. All in all though I loved it and can’t wait to go back.",Value for money:Food
"More than just its 5 star amenities, which is truly luxurious, this hotel has a very strong advocacy, which makes it the place to go. The Shangri-la is guardian to their surrounding forests, the creatures that live there (check out the Flying Foxes from their lobby at dusk), and the flora and fauna around it. They also have projects with local communities and the marine area near their beaches.

The breakfast was fabulous and the staff are well trained and helpful The kids indoor play facilities are really good. But, truth is, it cost a lot.

"Beautiful location, excellent food and idyllic surroundings.

Hotel rooms - large, clean and well equipped. Ours had a great sea view from the spacious and comfortably furnished balcony.
Facilities - transfers to white beach were convenient, sporting facilities and activities were great. The gym in particular is impressive. Wi-Fi was effective and fast throughout.
Food - breakfast was excellent, dinner in Sirena was good. The starters in particular were excellent, though the mains could be improved in execution and quantity.
Service - some service was exceptional. Breakfast service for example was impressive. The special assistance provided by management during our stay was warm and heartfelt and much appreciated.

There is some room for improvement, in two particular areas. 1. In making the transfer from the airport on arrival more slick and efficient. 2.In terms of consistency of service among all staff members. The concierge was pretty poor. Otherwise our stay was excellent and overall this hotel is a stand out place to stay with some truly exceptional hospitality on offer. The efficiency and effectiveness of service was far higher than that experienced elsewhere during our trip to the Philippines. Thank you to Mr Lina for his assistance during our stay, and to Shangri-La New Delhi for the introduction.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"When we arrived at Caticlan airport, our luggage was delayed.
The staff in the red uniform took care us about the delayed luggage and send us to the lounge via hotel's van before the speedboat picked up us to the resort. This was very helpful.

Very good landscape and beautiful architecture.
The resort had private beach and very nice swimming pools.
The resort located far from Dmall, If you wanted to go there, you could go by the shuttle bus. This route took time for 10 - 15 minute.

Except DMall, We didn't went to others place. We just only stayed in the resort and joined the safari snorkeling activity. The staff who took care this activity was very helpful.

Breakfast was good. Carbonara pizza at the pool bar was great. (It's so delicious and i really loved it)

We stayed here for 3 nights. the resort was very comfy and relaxing place.
It was a good experience and great time in Boracay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"Getting to Boracay is a bit of a hike but once youve placed yourself in the hands of the Shangri La staff everything is taken care of for you. I have never experienced better service. An absolutely beautiful resort, spacious rooms, great amenities, and plenty of activities to partake in. And an unbelievable breakfast to start your day. Have fun.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Stayed at the resort for three nights for a business conference. It is an absolutely amazing location. Staff are very friendly and the service is exceptional. Food was fantastic, specially the breakfast buffet. The facilities including private beaches, pools and the gym are first class and cannot be faulted. Highly recommend this resort.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Just recently completed a 3 night stay here for our long overdue honeymoon and unfortunately the experience was not what you'd associate with a resort that is supposedly 5-star. In fact, the only 5-star thing about it is the price tag (I paid $500 USD a night for the room).

Pros:
- After your flight lands at Caticlan airport you are whisked away in a private shuttle to a nice arrival lounge near the local jetty.
- Relaxing high speed boat transfer from jetty to Resort
- Resort itself has a nice private beach (we spent 90% of our time here)
- Many different restaurants on the property
- Sea view room is nice, but nothing special, looks quite dated. InterContinental Fiji and Bora Bora are on par with this price range and are actually worth the money
- Breakfast is included in room rate, and the spread is quite good.

Cons:
- Customer service is very knee-jerk here, they totally screw up badly and then after a long delay go the opposite direction trying to rectify issues and end up being overbearing for the rest of the trip asking if everything is okay at every passing moment. Find a middle ground guys!

Here's why customer service is pathetic here:
- Literally 2 minutes after checking-in to our room the ceiling started leaking heavily, we rang reception, who didn't seem bothered, and I waited 50 minutes for ""engineering"" to turn up and verify what was happening. After ""engineering"" verified that it was a big leak he disappeared for another 1 hour and 5 minutes. At this point we'd been in the same room with a leaking ceiling for a continuous 1 hr and 55 minutes after checking in, still exhausted from our early morning flights from Seoul with beach time reducing bit by bit.

- Duty manager finally returns my calls and comes to the room, in a brusque tone offers me a $50 food and beverage voucher and says, ""thats all we're doing"" - who is he to dictate what my compensation is? Secondly, I didn't want compensation, I just wanted a good room to start my honeymoon well. Add to that, when you're paying $500 USD a night and someone offers you a $50 food and beverage voucher, its an insult more than anything else - treat me like a valuable guest, not someone who you think is a waste of time.

Ultimately, management did try hard to rectify issues but only after I had escalated my problems publicly on Twitter and repeatedly asked to speak to the General Manager (who FYI was very busy entertaining guests on the property at a celebrity chef dining event - this is ridiculous). Several middle managers came up to us during breakfast on the remaining days and were overbearing asking us what had happened - please let me eat my breakfast in peace!

I would have given this property a 1 star, but it got 2 because they did try to rectify issues (on my last day).",Value for money:Staff:Food
