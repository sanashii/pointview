"Ok, but nothing special - especially for the price,Sunsets, pool, beach,It was okay. I usually stay in koh samui but thought I'd try somewhere different. It got off to a bad start - the check in process was ridiculous. Stood in line for 90 minutes! Got my room at 3pm, but still no bag by 6pm. In the end, I went downstairs and got it myself. Standard buffet was way too expensive. In fact, I felt like I was being gouged at every opportunity.",Food:Value for money

"Front Office Service Needs Improvement,Established Hotel which thinks of all client needs,The front office supervisor needs to be more guest oriented. She is a Korean and her staffs were busy and i asked her about changing my hotel transfer because i did not want to wait for the scheduled time and take a taxi. Instead of solving it for me (She was free) she told me to wait for her colleague who was busy attending to some other guests and i had to wait a good 10 minutes before another colleague was instructed by her to solve for me. Why is like that? If I am a supervisor, i would take initiative to get it resolved and not make the guest wait, everything is computerised and I am sure she can solve it. Or is it because she is the supervisor and it is not her work to do so? I wasted a precious 20 minutes before i could get a taxi because not sure when i could be attended to. The supervisor and managers needs to improve and be more service oriented like their front line staffs whom are always service oriented!",Staff

"Get away to relax,service was great from arrival to departure time. service staffs were attentive. great service especially at the front desk n the assistant manager.,Overall was very good. Unfortunately when I wanted to use the toilet in my room after checking in, I was shocked to see a tiny poo floating on the toilet bowl. I flushed few times n cleaned the seat before using it. When I was soaking in the tub, to my amazement I noticed poo stains around the toilet bowl and the shower curtain was stained with algae. As it was late I rest the matter till the following day. I called guest service the next morning to request for my toilet bowl to be cleaned with full information on the condition of the toilet bowl. When I returned from my swim, the same stains were still there. After my shower I got hold of the chambermaid and I gave her the instructions to clean and change the shower curtain which wasn't the job of hotel guest. I wonder if the guests service counter understood of my complain and communicated well with housekeeping department. Poo in the toilet bowl and stains upon checking in is not a small matter, but they didn't seem to take it seriously so much so I had to give direct instructions to the chambermaid. I believe before any check out room is released for new guest, the housekeeper should check thoroughly which in my case was not carried out. I took pictures of the curtain and stained toilet bowl. This is not acceptable at all for any hotel n especially Shangrila. I didn't make a big fuss as I didn't want the chambermaid to take the blame n ask to leave. I am writing so as to let Shangrila Mactan housekeeping department to improve. If you need the pictures as proof, I can provide them. I hope Shangrila Mactan gets a copy of what I am writing.",Staff:Cleanliness

"Unacceptable breakfast situation,Extensive grounds/activities available, friendly staff that tried their best (but you can tell they were stressed by the crowd) and reasonably comfortable sleep.,All was good except for the exceptional crowd the day we stayed and the need to queue/wait for breakfast. This the first time I have to queue to eat breakfast at a 5-star location. To me, this is unacceptable especially given the rate I paid. The facilities to cater for breakfast for a hotel that size was inadequate. I feel sorry for the staff that really tried their best to manage the crowd. I would like to commend the hotel on attempting to give me a room earlier, this was really appreciated. This made me feel that it is indeed a 5-star hotel abeit marred by the breakfast experience.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

I understand that you can pay extra to stay in the Ocean Wing and have more room but considering the rooms are not cheap anyway, we opted against this and I believe that given that you are paying decent money for a hotel in the Philippines, it should be much larger for those paying to a stay in the regular rooms. This was really only a minor problem on the Sunday as we were checking out and wanted to get some additional time round the pool (which is so comfortable and relaxing) and had to wait a while for a table so I would not advise this to deter anyone from going for this reason. The children's facilities for all ages are extremely well catered for so I would definitely recommend this for families. We do not have children and still had an amazing time though I must add it was off peak, I can imagine it being fairly noisy during peak times with lots of children. y",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Very Relaxing Family Holiday,Beach Pools Buffet Breakfast,This was our 7th year in a row to do this trip on October. It is an easy direct flight from Hong Kong on Cathay Pacific. We had an adjoining room with my parents which was nice. The view from the balcony facing the Ocean is amazing and we loved the buffet breakfast and pools. We had a favorite spot on the beach under the cabanas on the far left part of the beach as you face the ocean. The kids loved the activities like the water slide, beach toys, fish feeding, hermit crab racing, kids club, mini golf, and more. We will be back!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food

My advice is not to bother as getting anywhere in Philippines is a nightmare due to overcrowded roads. Took 1.5 hours to travel 20 km's.

If you are thinking of a kid friendly resort with lots of activities for them, then this would be for you. Place is absolutely swarming with families and the mad crowd of people during breakfast doesn't help either. The shuttle service to the malls are efficient and I would suggest going there to pick up snacks or dinner as eating at the hotel is very pricey! Spent 2100 php for one to have the dinner buffet which did not have anything spectacular to eat sadly. Service at Tides is really hit or miss as you may never get a drink unless you flag someone down. The cooks were very nice and cooked everything to your liking.

"Heavenly Resort in the Philippines,Pools, Breakfast Buffet, Friendly Staff,I went to this resort for my honeymoon. If you are looking for a nice resort with friendly staff, very clean rooms, big pools, water sports, delicious food, and a relaxing spa, this is the place for you! If you want to travel a lot outside of the resort, this may not be the best place for you, though. Mostly, activities finished around 6 PM and there didn't seem to be much of a nightlife. It was very child-friendly, so seemed to be a great place for families. I loved the free breakfast buffet at the Tides! With booking through agoda, I got a free breakfast buffet every morning. As for the restaurants, I found the Tides breakfast and dinner buffet to be amazing! We also ate at Tea of Spring, which wasn't as expensive as other places and had fantastic food and service. I was disappointed by Acqua. The Coves restaurant on the beach was OK. The ambiance was fantastic and the view of the ocean was very romantic, but the food was just middling for the price. It was better to visit for cocktails. We visited the SM Mall, just a relaxing 45 minute shuttle away. There were so many stores! It was a busy and uncomfortable shopping experience, but I got what I needed to get done there. Kultura is a great place for souvenirs. We went at lunch and we could hardly find any restaurants with seating. The surprising thing about the mall was the lack of bathroom facilities-- Long lines for the women's bathroom. The Chi spa was great! We purchased the Romantic Getaway package. It was the best part of the trip and well worth the money. If you stay on the resort, you will enjoy your stay, but if you leave the resort, be prepared to be disappointed by the public facilities. At the airport, you have to pay 550 pesos per person as an airport fee. While check in and check out times were reasonable, I wish they would improve their public facilities.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

Shangri-La Mactan also has great restaurants with international standard food. Of course all of this comes at international prices - don't expect it to be less expensive because it is the Philippines! Only area to fault Shangri-La Mactan is the room - it seemed a bit tired, and things did not work. Day 1 spent 90 minutes waiting for the in-room safe to be fixed. Day 2 the toilet stopped working, and after being fixed Day 3 is stopped working again.

We drifted asleep on the comfortable beach chairs staring at the beautiful sun rise off the ocean...not a bad start to our trip! We spent the next few days enjoying the beautiful and clean beach. We went snorkeling right off the beach, rented jet skis, etc. Breakfast and restaurants were good but can be crowded. In fact, the only drawback was the noisy tourists.

We arrived early and were given an early check-in card because our room was not yet available. The card was meant to give us access to guest-only areas, but instead we requested for a tour of the grounds and were happily obliged. Everything was lush and green and felt tranquil despite the number of guests present. Our room was airy and spacious, although not very centrally located. It was always a few minutes' walk everywhere because the place is so big. Still, we were happy. The staff were also very considerate of my requests, which went a long way in making our stay the best. They even gave us a very thoughtful and decadent ""Happy Birthday"" brownie. The beach was lovely although the sand was not fine. We saw a lot of fish even in shallow waters and had a blast just relaxing. The beach staff were very attentive, providing towels and setting up canopies. The buffet breakfast was massive and chaotic at times. I don't know if my expectations were overly high, but the food was just... good. Nothing mind-blowing in terms of flavor but quite overwhelming when it came to variety. We had a great pizza by the poolside, which we enjoyed very much. For our last day we had lunch at Tea of Spring and the dim sum was good but felt underwhelming. Overall we had a lovely joint birthday celebration/vacation.

"PARADISE.,beach, efficient service, all-around fun for kids and adults alike!,I stayed in Mactan Shang with my husband and kids for my birthday week-end. It is a 5-minute drive from the airport so we arrived in the hotel a tad early. The hotel was gracious enough to allow us to use the facilities while we waited for our room so that no time was wasted. Our room (deluxe) was spacious enough to fit 3 adults and 2 kids. Room-service was fast and efficient. The hotel gave us bottled water for free. And the staff's favorite expression is ""certainly"" and true enough, they gave us all that we asked for without hesitation! The pools are big and heavily guarded by attentive life-guards. We did not, however, spend too much time in the pool as we chose to enjoy the hotel's beach which is a marine sanctuary. Without having to swim too far, one can swim with and feed the fishies near the shore. My kids loved every minute of it. They have snorkeling gear for rent. We also tried other water activities like the jetski, banana boat--they were a bit pricey but totally worth it! As for the food, we loved their chinese restaurant (Tea of Spring) best. Tides was okay, too. The others were nothing great. If you would like to try cebuano seafood, head to the nearby Sutokil restaurants--reasonable and oh so yummy!

The upgrade fee was unreasonable in which we had to pay more than that if we just booked an ocean wing suite originally. The pool and beach was super awesome. The view was great. You can easily found tropical fishes just along the coast. But, surely if you aim at snorkelling, you should take an island hopping in Balicasag, Bohol. The staff were well-trained and attentive. Every staff will greet you with smile even you just pass by.",Staff
"A tropical dream comes true,First-class Hotel that really deserves five stars (spacious and clean room, excellent breakfast buffet, wonderful tropical garden with diverse pools),During our holidays staff members were at all times helpful and very friendly. The first room we got - located on the 9th floor (top floor) with view to the garden and parking lot- was noisy because of the generators running all night long on the the roof. The next day we got a new and refurbished room to the lovely pool and garden side with a grand sea view, all without any extra charge. We have been to many snorkeling sides (Key West,Red Sea and Thailand), but we made a top choice with the Shangri-La. The beach is full of fishes swimming around ones feet. The Beach is very clean, towels and sun chairs are included. The spa area ""chi"" is one of the most beautiful SPA we have ever seen. The setting is build in form of Japanese temple and villas with little water pools, koi fishes and flowers. Everything is very clean, neatly kept and decent (men and women separated, except for couple treatment). We enjoyed our breakfast buffet in the ""Tides"" Restaurant. They offer a huge variety of warm and cold Asian meals as well as continental breakfast. Fruits and sweets of different kinds are served as well. Everything is very freshly made and of excellent taste. The Italian Restaurant is located at the ocean wing of the hotel and offers a quite and more private atmosphere. The pizza is excellent and satisfies two persons whereas the pasta meals are small in portion although excellent in taste. This place we really recommend.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

As westerners who have traveled much of the world and stayed in many resorts, we have high expectations, especially when it comes to the overall value of a travel experience or stay. This location has yet to disappoint. Their service is pro-active in nature and unlike many ""island getaways"", they're not on island time. Things get done and they get done quick.

At the beach all the chairs were always taken there were rarely available. For the snorkeling I must say it was fabulous with a great variety of fishes and the children's activities were great as well. It was unfortunate that the service was so terrible and also the price of the food vs. the quality was very expensive for what it was and for every services,like the children's playroom, billiard, the snorkel materials rental, etc.. you have to pay it's a really not to what we were expected for the price we paid our room.",Value for money:Food:Staff

"Breath-taking Hotel,Shangri La's Beach Front and thw Free Wi-Fi all over the place.,Shangri La has already established a name for itself as it is already a common knowledge for everyone that it is a 5-star hotel. So already expect a good service from its staff, which I can attest to, nice, clean and spacious rooms with a great view of sunrise and sunset as well, great food, great facilities and everything that is to be expected of a 5-star hotel to have. But what made it stand out? It is actually their beach. I have been traveling all over the Philippines for quite some time now and have not actually adored Mactan's beaches since sand is not as fine as the one's in Boracay or Bohol, but Shangri La turned this around by actually developing their beach front. Yes its sand is not as fine, but hey, I haven't been to any hotel who need not to hire a boat to go somewhere to go snorkeling. It is readily available right at your door step as Shang has taken care of the reefs. Aside from that, they have outstanding beach beds. Oh yes, none that I have seen in most resort hotels that I have been to.

"Beautiful grounds and beach, pass on the food,Beach, atmosphere, staff,The hotel location is great, very close to the Mactan airport - on a beautiful scenic beach. The 'refurbished' rooms are nice, but make sure you pay the relatively small extra fee for an ocean view room - the other side view of the hotel rooms is very poor, and the upgrade cost once you're there is higher (3x more for us to change upon seeing the non-ocean view room). The beach is picture perfect, however, the sand is absolutely coarse and not very comfortable to walk on. Snorkeling here was great, lots of big parrot fish and other colorful species right near the shore. The food was not good at all, and we were sold on the ""day packages"" with inclusive dinner buffet and non-motorized water sports for $100/day (which is what the buffet dinner costs for 2 by itself). It's in your best interest to pay for any beach gear you want to use separately and go anywhere else for dinners, the food was really bad and changed each night - so the one (or none) thing you find that's good is gone the next night. Restaurants in the area are relatively cheap, so you can save money and eat much better by getting out of the hotel grounds and get your food somewhere else. Staff was wonderful and friendly.",Location:Value for money:Food
"Another great stay at the Shangri-La!,Service, Staff, Property, Amenities,I was scheduled to attend diving classes over the weekend at Scotty's at Shangri-La and decided to book an overnight stay so that my family could enjoy a weekend on the beach. Having stayed here before, I did not have to do any research prior to making the reservation; this place had easily exceeded my expectations in the past. Once again, the staff at the Shangri-La left nothing to be desired. Due to my dive classes, my wife had to spend the weekend caring for our 1 year old daughter and although this can be a daunting task, the staff always went out of its way to help her, without ever being prompted. I had an amazing first dive experience exploring the Shangri-La Marine Sanctuary and on the drive home (we're Canadians temporarily located in Cebu), we did nothing but chat about the excellent service and time we had. The only downside about this resort are some of the unreasonable prices for food. We planned on dining at the Buko Bar by the pool area for a quick, laid back dinner and discovered the only option was a Hawaiian buffet. The options were rather limited, especially considering the bill came to over Php4000 for 2 adults with only 1 alcoholic drink on the tab. We didn't even come close to getting the value we should have out of the meal; it's not like they were serving a nice spread of seafood or expensive cuts of meat. To summarize, in terms of service, the Shangri-La is best in class when it comes to service",Staff:Food:Value for money

Service was great - but sometimes over the top ""how are you?"" ""good morning"" ""good afternoon"" etc. - we wanted to say ""leave us alone!"" at times. Also, if it rains (as it did for one day) it's nice to sit back and read, but there's not that much else to do. We took a shuttle to the mall but that was kind of weak.
