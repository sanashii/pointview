"It fell short of our previous experience last April which brought great delight.,the pool and pool staff,We availed of the Horizon Club because we were extremely pleased by our previous experience last April 2017. Recommended to us as check-in, at that time it lived up to the build-up of the front desk clerk who said the food quantity and choices, though not comparable of course to HEAT, would be more than adequate. Sadly, this time it was far from satisfactory. Upon arrival, the tea provided disappointed. So too did the cocktails and sadly, even breakfast. I'm not sure I will do this again . My daughter even commented that perhaps the Hotel was downsizing or trying to skimp.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"Excellent customer service and leisure amenities but room's hygiene needs to be checked,The top 3 things we liked about the hotel are the location, the staff and the leisure amenities (the gym and the pool in particular). We stayed at EDSA Shangri-la only for a night. The hotel is linked to Shangri-la Plaza mall. This allowed us to do our last-minute shopping before our flight the following day and it allowed myself and partner a movie date night too. The second thing we liked is the customer service. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Lastly, the leisure amenities, particularly the gym and the pool, are impressive. They well-staffed and clean. The gym equipment looks properly maintained and have wide variety of options.,We had several issues with the room that we raised with the manager when we checked out. One of the first things we noticed when we entered our room was that the toilet flush was broken. We had to call for someone to fix it. Second was the old hair dryer. The old thing's cord was pieced together by a black electric tape, which looked like it was done by a 5-yr old. Its strongest power is also as strong as those portable, battery operated, small fans. For a 5-star hotel, I'm pretty sure they could afford replacing this hair dryer to a new one. The major issues we encountered were about cleanliness. We didn't notice them at first since we were only in the room for few minutes after checking in. Coming back from the mall at late in the evening, we noticed the first 2 cleanliness issues - the funky smells in the bathroom and bed area. The bathroom smelled like dried urine and drain next to the toilet bowl was filled with dried hair. The bed area smelled like smelly feet. Then, I woke up at 5:30 am with rashes all over my arms. I took an anti-histamine pill and went back to sleep. They were gone when I woke again an hour later but my fiance and my brother-in-law who visited us could see the traces of the rashes at mid-day. Also, when my fiance woke up, he could not stop sneezing until we left the room for breakfast. The entire time we were not in the room, my fiance didn't sneeze at all. The moment we got back to the room, he sneezed non-stop again. The room clearly had hygiene issues. Other small things that I noticed were the absence of room service menu and the room service in the evening was also not that efficient. At around 10:30 pm, we ordered tea and whiskey for room service. They were delivered in our room after almost 45 minutes. That's pretty long for just drinks.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness

Either make it a juice or plain water.covered parking not offerred unless you ask. For first timers, you certainly wouldnt ask. And no bath salt.

The range of restaurants available in the hotel was good as it offers different cuisines which most hotels don't offer.,Although we found the hotel seeming to lack the luxury tag of a 5-star luxury hotel that is to be a Shangrila. The pool area was nice but nothing wonderful, the buffet breakfast restaurant was full each of the 3 mornings i was there forcing us to a make-shift buffet which wasn't as good, yet we still had to pay the same money. I understand in a hotel like Shangrila that prices of food and drinks will be significantly more expensive than outside, but in terms of value for money, 700 pesos for very plain vegetarian spring rolls around the pool just simply isn't worth it, this also extended to other food and beverage items throughout our stay.

Is that a right procedure to do for a 5 star hotel? Yes they've offered us to move to another room after complaining what happened but what's the sense of moving after getting all the dust from the execution of the job? management didn't do anything good with the complain and it's very disappointing.

They had to improvised and put a waste basket in the middle of the room just to keep the water off the floor. Edsa Shangri-la, you are not helping!!! We were behind schedule as it is so we had to be extra cautious to prevent any liquid staining the wedding gown. It probably didn‚Äôt helped that the weather was blazing hot but the AC in the rooms and facilities (ballrooms) were not working properly. But we were still hoping it would somehow improve. AC was not cool enough (we set it up at the coolest temperature) for all rooms due to ongoing repairs happening in the hotel and they said they would cranked up the AC around 3 am. By the time we came back from Church, we decided to get something from our room ‚Äì only to find out that our room was flooded from the damaged water line. Apparently, this has been going on for 30 minutes while we were at Church. May I just point out if you were a part of a wedding entourage this is such a waste of time and hassle. Boo Edsa Shangri-la! We couldn‚Äôt get inside but luckily our things were spared from the water. Staff had to get our things inside the safe and they had to transfer all of our things to another room. Sad thing was we didn‚Äôt get to take any family pictures because I was busy staring at our room filled with water. Management could have done a lot more improvement.

I was the one who personally chose this hotel because I'm very confident that being one of the well know hotels in the country surely my parents will be taken cared off. But to my disappointment, NO. Me and my sister was already coordinating the said booking right after it was booked in Agoda. Everything was running smoothly and even car service was arranged. We went to EDSA Shangri-La to settle the booking and to our surprise, they told us that there was no booking. Talks here and there until after two to three hours finally they were able to traced the booking. The question is, how on earth we were able to coordinate with this establishment so smoothly thru email and have encountered problems when we went there personally. At the time of checking-in, again problem arises. No confirmed car service well in fact from day number one it was there in the booking, fully paid. There was no hair dryer in the room.

"Way below 5 Stars! ,A single positive: upon check in I was upgraded to a suite, due to unavailability of my requested room. Sadly this was the only positive experience during my stay.,As a very frequent traveller I must say the experience during this hotel stay was probably my worst ever in a five star hotel in Asia: - When needed, I had to call Guest Services several times from my room. The phone usually rang 20-30 times before answered, if at all answered. - a call to Housekerping to make up my room was ignored. After a reminder call 40 minutes later, I was told they'd come to clean immediately ... A third call, some 20-25 minutes later was required to finally get the job done! - Room Service is slow and unreliable. Was told 30 mins delivery time and waited well over an hour! - I had to extend my hotel stay. Different rates were quoted by different staff. The final quote I received was in my view overpriced. After voicing my disagreement over the price, the quoted rate was immediately adjusted down. i guess less experienced travelers, who may not push back on 'outrageous' pricing, are simply overcharged. - mini bar wasn't re-restocked daily. - the hotel interior is old, the sofa in the suite seems more for decoration as comfortable seating is a challenge. - I had one dinner at Paparazzi, one of the hotel's restaurants, which was disappointing re food quality. The ordered starter wasn't fresh and had to be returned. Service quality in the restaurant is below par. - upon departure I ordered a hotel limo to get me to the airport. The car showed up 10 minutes late. - Lastly, the hotel security is clearly a farce! The focus seems to be on selected people only and is not done professionally at all. While I observed mainly local people being checked (if the performed action can be called a security check), I walked through 'security' twice with large paperbags (containing things I bought outside the hotel) without any checks being performed. I confronted the respective 'security' staff about such lack of diligence, but all I got back was embarrassed smiles. Would I recommend Edsa Shangri-La?

Amenities not complete - only one toothbrush for a booking of two person, no vanity kits like cotton, comb - unusual for a 5-star hotel, and for a Shangri hotel name. The complimentary cookies looks like it was just tossed on the table. No turn down service on our first night.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"Volver√≠a a Filipinas,Lo que m√°s me gusto fue el gimnasio y el restaurante. La comida excelente y muy variada. La atenci√≥n del personal estupenda, muy amables y dispuestos a ayudar en todo,La climatizaci√≥n se estropeo pero nos solucionaron el problema r√°pidamente. Quiz√° el ba√±o un poco peque√±o y la habitaci√≥n un poco antigua",Comfort & Facilities:Food
