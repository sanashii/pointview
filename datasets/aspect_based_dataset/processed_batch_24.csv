"Great hotel with awesome beach,Nice rooms with a view and awesome beach for swimming and snorkling,The hotel was grand. Accomodations was wonderful. Shuttle was not free, but convenient from the airport. Beach and swimming pool areas are awesome. Food was mediocre and very expensive. Everytime you buy something it includes service charge and 12% VAT. The hotel was supposed to be a double occupancy but I was charged double because on my hotel voucher from Agoda it only showed 1 person. Anyways, I didn't want to ruin my short and expensive stay in this hotel, so I went ahead and just pay for it and never complained. But as far as I was concerned, that was stupid for them to do that.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"Fabulous location and beautiful resort,Excellent experience,Magnificent resort, staff treat you like royalty, very comforting environment. It was an absolute delight staying here and would recommend it to anybody, you pay a bit more than avarege but well worth it. We sampled most of the restaurants and all of them were excellent. Can't wait until we return for another totally relaxing time. One thing to watch out for is the taxi's don't like going to the resort and want to charge you more than the meter rate, as they say they can't get a return fare, I didn't understand this as they are a short distance way from the airport...",Location:Value for money:Staff

"Shang but missing the ri-La,Beautiful location, some departments have quick and efficient service.,We were received warmly upon arriving. Check in was relatively quick since there were a lot of people checking in. Luggage arrived very promptly. The room was nice however, tv was old and picture was snowy. Bath tub had a lot of deep scratches making it look dirty. Other than the two, we did not have any complaints. Room air conditioning was nice and cool. Room service is very quick, but they miss anticipating the need for condiments. All positive for the pools and beach. Personnel at the pools were very friendly and quick to serve your needs. Food serving was rather slow in Tea of Spring. The breakfast buffet was jam packed so ordering omelletes at the egg station and coffee took a long time to be served. Checking out early in the morning was a bit of a hassle as there was only one receptionist at that time. We were rushing to the airport but had to wait in line. But in fairness, for guests like me who are no-nonsense type of guys, was able to be checked out in less than 5 minutes when my turn came. So my overall comment is that I have had better experiences at other Shangrila resorts and Shangrila Mactan was just as beautiful however misses in some points making it just a Shang... without the ri-La or it was incomplete. I have come to have a high expectation when it comes to their hotel/resort based on my previous experiences with their other resorts.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Family hotel wiht great service and location,Private white sand beach,We had a wonderful stay at Shangri-La's Mactan Resort & Spa. Location is really great, especially the private white sand beach. Rooms are Ok and can be sometimes a bit far away from the restaurant, as the complex is really big. Service is very good (as often in Asia). Food from the buffet was good too. I would not recommend it for a romantic escape, as it is really a big resort with many rooms. It's ideal for a family.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food

And I would like to recommend you to join the free class teaching snorkeling and etc. We should have experienced more classes!

"Paradise on the Beach,Colorful snorkeling and a great buffet,We booked in the Ocean Wing on Agoda, then purchased a reasonable upsell to a premiere suite when we arrived at check-in. The view from the balcony was gorgeous, the bathroom luxurious, and housekeeping left us fresh flowers and mangoes after tidying up. The beach is nice (especially on a sunny day). It's a bit rocky when you get in the water, but it makes the snorkeling excellent! We saw colorful parrot fish, clown fish, sargeant majors, eels, bright blue star fish and the list goes on.

"Great Hotel but small rooms and too many kids,Nice facilities and nice private beach,i wrote an earlier review but don't know if it was submitted so here's a re-write/summary. i've stayed at this hotel several times prior and so decided to stay again. the biggest change is that this shangrila has now become more of a children and family-friendly hotel and definitely not for those adults who want a peaceful, romantic getaway with quietness and serenity. there were kids everywhere and if this is what you want, then bring your family and children here and they will love it. however, if you're an ""adults-only"" style traveler who want to enjoy some peace and quiet from more 'mature' company then sadly this shangrila has gone away from that and definitely is more for those with 2 or more kids! it's full of them and if you're a solo or lone couple you will definitely be a minority. the front-end checkin staff sadly did not perform to our expectations. they were rude, indifferent to our concerns, and just plain fake. however, all the other staff from the waiters, to servers, to bell-boys, concierge, security, housekeeping, beach valets, etc - were terrific. absolutely star performers and keeping with the shangrila brand and high quality. it made up for the front-end/check-in staffs incompetence.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"(Complaint) ""Stressful arrival"",Good restaurants,Dear Sir or Madam, Once again I would like to stress how grateful I am with the amendments made with the below booking and the original mix up with the dates etc. However, I really feel you will benefit from the feedback I am about to give you. On arrival to the Shangri La hotel in Mactan Cebu last Monday afternoon the concierge were unaware of the below booking because ""Agoda had not forwarded these details to them (Shangri La)"". Therefore, apart from feeling a great deal of embarrassment that I had somehow made a mistake, my girlfriend and I were told we would need to spend the entire day on stand by waiting for a room to become available as the hotel was full. This caused a great deal of stress for the both of us as we weren't sure if we would have to book another hotel in Cebu. Furthermore, we were wasting a large portion of the day we could be enjoying in our hotel room that I had previously paid for. I really feel that the hotel should have apologised for this mix up and we both felt some token of compensation was due - unfortunately they did not offer any apology or gesture of good will. It was only through my own perseverance and insistence that a room could finally be provided. I would please ask that you consider the above feedback for your future customers and ensure the appropriate contact is made prior to guests arriving. There was an unnecessary amount of stress and embarrassment here, that I'm sure you will agree will not bode well for your company. I have lost confidence in Agoda and I sincerely hope that it will be restored in the future. Many thanks Kind regards",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

Everything you need to have fun and relax is at the resort. The food is great. The rooms are really comfortable. The facilities available are ridiculous. You get lost in time while in this resort. The staff were extra friendly, it was a no fuss holiday until I left my camera in one of their hotel taxi's. They were never able to retrieve it. I felt that no one was really there to help me.

The beach is not as nice as say Boracay's but it's got snorkelling right there so it's more fun. My major complaint is the slow service at the seafood restaurant. We ordered a grilled seafood platter for two and it took over one hour to come and the restaurant was half empty! The waitress explained it's because they only have one chef / one grill.

The pools are great, the snorkeling fantastic from the beach, although it is annoying that you are allowed to walk out over the coral at low tide, and there is plenty of fun sports and entertainment to keep you occupied during the day. We chose a club room this time, and really the benefits were not as good as other club rooms we have stayed before.

"Shangri La Mactan is a Unique Hotel on its own,The Marine Park just at your doorstep,I have always look forward to stay in Shangrila Mactan as it is one of the most beautiful hotel because of two reasons 1) The marine park is one of the best that i have visited and you need not go far to see coral fishes - parrot fish, pike fish, clown fish, mullet, angel fish, squid and schools of fish as though you are diving. 2) The Filipino service level again never fails - prompt efficient service request - no nonsense or reasons to be given...they just aim to please. Anything that they cannot provide is done with a sympathetic 'I wish I could do it' the only set back is you need to pay for the extras which makes it one of the very pricey hotels in Cebu. But the worse is not Shangrila Mactacn but AGODA THAT CANCELED MY ROOM AND WHEN I REQUESTED TO REINSTATE THE ROOM I HAD TO DO 3 REMINDERS AND THERE WAS JUST A CURT REPLY - WE HAVE DONE IT AFTER I LEFT THE HOTEL THE NEXT DAY.

Even the kids enjoyed the beach and the facilities. We just stayed ther for 3 whole day withoput even thinking of going to the mall or other places. I just encountered one problem, when wew were checking out, our baggage were grouped together with another guest and we almost lost them. I told the bellboy that we are not with the same group but he still joined our baggage witht he other guest who was going back to Singapore. We looked for our baggage for almost 309 mins.

The room and hotel itself was perfectly maintained, the beach was much better than expected (Cebu beaches aren't touted as the Philippines' best), and the breakfast buffet was huge, as it always is with Shangri-La hotels. The only downside was witnessing the staff ""feeding"" the fish with styrofoam pellets during during our snorkeling trip. The purpose was to attract the fish, who mistook it for food, though fortunately, none of them ate it. It is still something the staff should not do, as it pollutes the otherwise pristine sea.",Staff:Food

"Run down hotel- horrible bathrooms,Large resort, family friendly, various F&B outlets, friendly staff,the best thing about our stay was that the staff was very helpful in getting us an early check in at 8am, as we landed at around 4:30am and got to the hotel at a little before 6am. this and the generally friendly staff throughout the trip, the hotel itself is nothing above mediocre. my only issue is that this hotel is supposed to be a shangri-la, not a holiday inn. first off, not all the rooms are renovated, and the rooms located in the main area above the lobby are extremely old fashioned and not at all worthy of being called shangri-la but more fitting to be motel 6 rooms. the bathrooms were especially horrible, with the old bathtub/shower combination which would literally took more than 5 hours to completely drain and left the dirt and grime at the bottom of the tub. the toilets would re-flush up a nice surprise a few hours after it had been flushed. you can tell from the old tv boxes just how old the rooms are. one positive about the rooms however, were the comfortable beds, although the sheets were nowhere near fresh and new, the bed was extremely comfy. the second issue we encountered was at the italian restaurant, acqua. while the poolside menu was fine (pizza and smoothies), while dining at dinner, i ordered a salmon carpaccio which after one bite, i knew would not go down well. the taste was very off- not fresh at all, as the color was also that suspicious and rubbery pink. this wasn't the issue however, as these things happen and i was not too upset over this. as the waitress approached to clear our appetizers for the main, she noticed that less than i had taken less than one bite and asked if there was anything wrong with it. i am grateful she at least did this, but after i told her that it did not taste fresh and i didn't want to risk getting sick from it, she simply smiled and took the plate away. i later expected the dish to be taken off the bill, but it was not and no apology was offered. my main dish of seared tuna was also below standard",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Not outstanding but still very good,Great facilities,I have stayed at several Shangri-La Hotels & Resorts around the world, and I must say, I was a little disappointed by the room.

"Staff friendly but the service is spotty,Beautiful setting on beach,Shangri-la, overall, was not bad. I do not plan on returning to this hotel, however, as it was just not enough bang for the buck. The first night of my arrival, I needed to pick up a friend from the airport very late in the evening. I inquired as to the best way to get to the airport and the receptionist's response was that I should hire a hotel car for 1100 pesos roundtrip. I asked if I could take the hotel shuttle, which I knew was available. She said the last shuttle was at 10, and I needed the ride at midnight. I ask if they could call a taxi for me. She said the cab was ""by chance"" meaning that if there was a cab dropping off a passenger, I could wait in the lobby and hop in. Whaaaa???? Incredulous, I asked to speak to the manager. She said she would call me back. When she called back, she said she would be able to call me a cab. Not sure whether I could hold the cab at the airport while I fetched my friend for the trip back to the hotel, I ended up going with the hotel's hired car, thinking it's too late at night to risk being stranded at the airport without a guaranteed ride back. At the airport, I see Shangri-la's shuttle. I asked the driver and he says whenever there's a flight landing, the hotel will send a car. Why could I not just have taken the shuttle then???",Staff

There were renovations going on in the central area of the hotel, but we couldn't hear any noise at all from our rooms as we were far enough away. We tried most of the restaurants during our stay and I would recommend Cowrie Cove for dinner - they have tables outside overlooking the water and serve fresh seafood. The Chinese restaurant and Aqua were good for lunch. One night when we were there, they had a Filipino grill night with a live performance and this was a great opportunity to try all different kinds of Filipino food.

Lunch in the small cafe was delicious and I enjoyed a nice buffet the one night we all ate at the hotel. The hotel is pretty easy to get to downtown Cebu from and I would most definitely stay here again for my next business trip. Note: I stayed in the newly renovated rooms. They are tastefully done and very well maintained by the staff. Nice little bar area for coffee and the bathroom and closet space were fine. My view was of the ocean and the grounds (toward the street side not the beach side) but my associates view was of the pool and ocean side.

The stations were kept fulled right to the last minute and this was just the breakfast buffet. Water sports offered were scuba, snorkeling, parasailing and wave runners plus island excursions. The snorkeling from the beach was fantastic and they let keep the equipment for as long as we wanted to the hour rental. A bar/restaurant on the beach with plenty of umbrellas and lounge chairs made it all the better. There is also a ""spa village"" yes, village, on site.

I understand and accept that higher food prices are to be expected at a resort, but this was beyond what I expected (and expensive even by USA standards).

If you are one of those very busy people, always on the daily grind, a 3 day to a week stay at this resort will truly re-energize you. The Chi Spa is a great experience and provides relaxing massage and other therapies. The architecture of the Chi Spa is truly inspiring and mystical and you will feel as if you are in another realm, a more spiritual world. The beach and the food/bar cafe provides you a wonderful beach experience. You can hang around in beach while being served with nice grilled food and good drinks. The Happy Hour at the bar is also an experience you must not miss while watching the sunset at the exclusive beach cove of the resort. The design of the beach bar truly complements the nature elements and it provides a more relaxing feel to whole experience. The rolling gardens is also a treat especially while you are having your breakfast buffet. The rooms are comfortable and fully equipped. I especially love the sound system in bathroom while soaking in the tub with the complementary salt soak and scrub.

I found out that the hotel was at only 70% occupied. It would have been nice had I been upgraded for free especially since it was my first time and I was alone.

In short, everything you need is in the resort. No need to go out for anything.

We had a wonderful time and the service was really great - starting from check-in in our Garden View Room (this was a life saver after having traveled so far with two small children - one and four!), then from fixing our showerhead (twice) very quickly, finding my lost camera from the local taxi driver after having dropped it in the back seat (thanks Christine from Guest Services!), the shuttle service to two different shopping malls, invitations to a cocktail party (which we unfortunately missed), to offering us a wonderful reminder of the Shangri-La in the form of a gift (a beautiful frame / box from the Philippines). Tips: Definitely go snorkeling - tons of fish! Nemo, puffer fish, lion fish, stonefish, moray eels, etc... Try a drink at sunset at the Cowrie Cove! Play pool / table tennis out by the beach! Take your kids to the Adventure Zone!....and don't forget to take it easy on their hammocks with the wonderful sea breeze blowing!! The only negative things I could mention would be that although the daily activities for kids 3 and under were free; activities for kids 4 and up had a fee. It would have been nice if that had been included as part of the rate. And the other thing was that we were not aware that there was an airport shuttle (which we obviously missed early morning) and had to hire their private car to the airport which was some US$20 (as compared to US$2.50)! Lesson learned: ask if they have an airport shuttle. But all in all, we would go again!",Staff:Food

The beach, swimming areas, and food are unlike most of the other resorts.

There was construction going on, so I hope they are upgrading the current situation. However, I personally didn't think it was worth $300+/night that we spent- especially when a free buffet breakfast was included. Since our flight left at an ungodly hour, I asked the front desk if they would pack us a breakfast... They sent us off to the airport with only a croissant, yogurt, and and apple. I'm pretty sure that the buffet stipulation doesn't mean continental breakfast since I've eaten there before.

"Trip to Cebu,Best hotel in Cebu,Expensive,Shangri-la Cebu is the best resort hotel in Cebu as the room space, service quality, food, romantic restaurant, private beach, nice pools, high class spa...etc. The best of all, it's not as crowded as other resort hotels nearby! My families and I always want to stay at Shangri-la as our first choice when we visit Cebu.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

The staff is very helpful and friendly - I have gone back several times now. The spa is world class and has some of the best masseurs I have ever experienced! A definite must stay!",Food:Staff:Location
"best resort in Mactanas there is not much to do,- its the only resort that is good in Cebu - Private beach (however very small),- everything is overpriced, accommodation, food, facilities, EVERYTHING - room is old and not the best,if you are going to Mactan to relax and hang out with family then this is the place to go to. i dont recommend doing much around Mactan as there is nothing to do.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

Shuttle service to the malls were useful. Shuttle service to airport should be extended to later hours.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"excellent!,The staff is very friendly and the resort is very nice.,Everthing is very very expensive. You could step out the gates and go to a bar across the resort for half of the price. The buffet we had for dinner was not worth the money either.,I loved the private beach and the stay at the resort. The staff was very friendly and the room service was very good.",Staff:Value for money:Food

"S. Hall USA,Beautiful gardens, pools and beach area. Plenty of activities for the most active of people or just kick back and chill on the beach while sipping (or guzzling) a frozen Mai Tai or whatever your beverage of choice. The dining options are outstanding; Italian, Chinese, Korean, Filipino, American. All of the restaurants are first rate. Must hit the Buko bar after sunset. They have filipino buffet with live traditional filipino music and dance (bring your video camera).,Can't think of a single thing negative.,We loved snorkling right off the beach. Plenty of tropical marine life. Nice cocktail bar on the beach. Must try the Halo Halo (a filipino favorite dessert). The entire staff was extremely nice and friendly, from management to the grounds keepers! They always have a smile and a friendly greeting. The view from the Ocean Wing is spectacular. The ""Chi"" spa was a very unique and relaxing experience. I am not sure if my massage therapist was any good or not because she put me to sleep in about 5 minutes. My fiance' and myself recieved a couples ""Romantic Get-a-way"" massage at the same time and same Challet'. She later told me the only reason she didn't fall asleep was my snoring kept her awake. Shangri-La resort and spa Mactan Island, Cebu Philippines is on top of my list of places to visit again.",Food:Staff:Location

Look forward to staying there again.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"It's the Shangri-La after all,Shangri-la service, well-known and world renowned. Lots of staff around to ensure that you will get quick attention. Nice Pool, excellent children activity centre.,Things are expensive, but expectedly so. Rooms in the new ocean wing have thin walls and you can hear the alarm or phone ring in the opposite room.,The Shangri-la Mactan in Cebu makes you feel very isolated from everything else around you. Its very possible to just remain in the hotel without having to go to town unless you are a die-hard shopper. Food is of generally high quality at the Tides and the Cowrie Cove restaurant. Sea activities are very expensive. Scuba diving is expensive, typically about US$100 per dive but service is excellent. There is a great infinity pool overlooking the ocean, better in the afternoon and evenings so that the sun doesn't shine directly into your eyes.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Wonderful resort,Comfortable resort hotel for every aspects.,There is ground excavation from the view to the Hilton hotel side. That spoils the atmosphere of the resort.h,The ground floor area is open and very comfortable architect plan everywhere. Loccitane amenities are prepared.

Everything meets international standards.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
"October stay at Shangri - La in Cebu,Wonderful hotel! Beautiful grounds, and room. Entire staff always friendly, and eager to please.Great food at all the resturants, and plenty of activities for kids, and adults.,I will not hesitate to stay here again, when I come to visit Cebu. The stay was beyond my expectations.",Food:Location:Staff
"Enjoyable place,Great views and snorkeling,Prices are little crazy.,I had a great room overlooking the pool and ocean. Snorkeling on their private beach is fantastic. An amazing number of fish right on the door step. At night we found a secluded area on the beach and watched a school of fish circling under the spot light. Very romantic location. As with many resorts you're a captured audience and the prices reflect this. A beer from the hotel will cost you three times the price of buying it outside the resort. We went to the local supermarket and bought our own in. No one questioned us carrying grocery bags in either. There are a few nice places to eat just outside the resort that will cost a third of the price of the places inside and you can walk to them.",Value for money:Location
"totally fell in love with Shangrila Mactan Cebu,we love the hotel's ambiance, the location is perfect. it has a nice view and a lot of activities prepared for the guests. The staff is also very friendly and attentive. The food is good too. There are lifeguards everywhere so i would safe it's safe esp for kids,Hmm..we didnt totally liked the beach because there were small stones..hard to walk without an aqua socks. Good thing, Shangrila have aqua socks ready for rent.,We are a newly married couple. This is our first beach holiday since we got married (6months ago). We totally fell in love with Shangrila Mactan! The view from our ocean view room is spectacular. The bed/pillows/blanket is so comfortable. We loved the mangoes they sent in our room too, what a nice gesture. The staff are all friendly and accomodating. They are ready with a smile and ready to give us tips about Cebu. I would definitely recommend this hotel to all of my friends. 5 Stars for Shangrila Mactan!",Staff:Location:Comfort & Facilities

All the plants are beautiful, organized and people there are friendly and nice.,Not much.,I've been staying in Cebu for these 6 years and a half and sometimes visiting this hotel. I guess this is the best hotel to stay in Cebu for the people that really want to enjoy the tropical atmosphere and comfort. Price is a bit high but it will give you nice memory in Cebu.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"shangri la Hotel in Cebu,staff are friendly, beaches are pretty,rooms are old, daily operation poor. Washing basin drainage did not work properly. Facilities are old.,Shangrila is a very reputable hotel in Asia, their services have been positive. Whenever we travel in Asia, Shangrila has always been our first choice. After visited Cebu last week, we found that Shangrila Hotel there need upgrade their facilities. For Example our room had the drainage plugged for 4 days, and nobody really inspected the cleanness of all rooms each day. Until we phoned the house keeping during our last day stay, the service staff finally came and found that the drainage was plugged with very thick dirt that made us feel throw up. It is so easy that the house keeping department only need a few seconds for each room to check whether the water drain smoothly in both washing basin and bath tub. Guests pay so much money and did not get the value will be very annoy. We certainly continue using Shangrila for our future visits in different countries in Asia, provided that their rooms are well kept.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"My Week at the Shangri-la Mactan Island,This is a moderately priced first class resort. No expense has been spared in keeping the grounds,hotel, free standing restaurants and recreational facilities world class. It is located in a secured compound. The entrance has armed guards and they do have a look inside your trunk. They are alert, courteous and their attire and guard shack are impeccable. In these days of political unrest, they are a comforting presence. The Hotel Lobby was a unique work of architecture which is large, open and artful. It seems to flow into the outside grounds with walkways, terraces, adequate lighting perched above the sea.,I think the buffet could use a wider variety of dishes, but the food was generally good and plentiful. The seafood, Italian and Steakhouse restaurants were excellent in service and quality, but could have been opened a bit later in the evening, as well as the gift shops.,Overall I give this resort 5 out of 5 stars. There were always plenty of neatly dressed and polite staff about the facility who greeted you with a friendly smile, useful information and assistance. Staying there I felt I was in the mythical Shangri-la, above the often ramshackle and impoverished rest of the island. I highly recommend this little piece of heaven.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Simply the Best!,The Shangri-La offers spectacular clean and huge grounds. We have always experienced courteous and professional services in all areas. Guests really do not have to leave the hotel as everything is there. There is an array of cuisine to choose from. The activities are numerous and available for one to enjoy.,This is our third time this year to the Shangri-La Mactan Island. From the moment we arrived and were greeted, it was truly a memorable experience and we felt like we were returning home and to old friends. The services and facilities are great and needs no improvement. With a mention of our anniversary to our server (whom we adore and have seen on all 3 occasions), to our delight a cake and bottle of wine awaited us in our room. What a surprising and welcoming touch to our already fabulous stay. This time we enjoyed immensely as it was nice, peaceful and quiet the entire duration of our vacation. Thanks again Shangri-La and look forward to many more returns in the coming year.",Staff:Food
"Wonderful Experience,Very good service, excellent staff and beautiful property.,Not really for the budget conscious, also quite away from other activities in Cebu.,Shangri - La Cebu is a beautiful resort away from the Cebu City. Its beach is lovely and there are loads of activities to do within the resort. During our stay there was a Filipino cultural event as well and we got a sneak preview into the different dances and cultures from all across Philippines.
