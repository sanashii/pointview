"Good location, and staff were friendly. Outdated though.,We stayed there because we were attending an occasion there. It was probably a fantastic hotel 15 - 20 years ago, but it's a bit dated and a bit past its prime. Staff were friendly. Comfortable enough. But there are better hotels around that are also called ""5 star"". NOTE: If you stay in one of the suites which give you access to the Horizon Lounge? Don't expect what other 5 star hotels offer. Food was only average. ""High Tea"" was limited. Breakfast average. ""Cocktails"" actually HAD no cocktails at all! They said we would have to order from the bar downstairs, and pay for it! If t's ""beer and wine only"", then don't call it cocktails! Shop around!",Food:Staff:Value for money
"No swimming pool,Swimming played a big part in our vaca and kids were very disappointed to learn that the swimming pool was unavailable and under renovation. Taking a shuttle to the BGC Shangrila pool was an unreasonable option. We're supposed to be in a premier hotel and we have to commute through Manila traffic to enjoy the pool? Other than that, hotel services and staff were excellent.",Comfort & Facilities
"its over priced ,good looking staffs, atmosoher and the music in lobby,regarding the location is amazing, but i think its not a 5 stars hotel as the are many constructions and painting going on and the steam room is all shut down for the maintenance. the hotel price is overpriced i think the need to adjust their prices according due to the maintenance and other inconvenient issues.",Value for money
"Food and restaurant staff,Location, Location, Location,The room (Executive) was good, the room service was good. The food in the base restaurant was bad (afternoon tea), another try for a simple club sandwich was disappointing. This was the experience on our first day. So we prefered to have our diner and lunch outside the hotel for the next six days. The staff in this restaurant was not alert at all, we had to remind them to get served our food, which was ready to serve, a very disappointing experience for this class of hotel. Peter West",Food:Staff:Location
"Disappointed,Location,It was disappointing because me and my family had stayed at a different 5 star hotel the previous day and Shangrila couldn't even compare. The food sucked, it was bland and flavorless especially the club house sandwich i ordered from the pool bar that took 30 mins to make. The bathroom walls had black stains so disgusting! The bath tub looked really old and had brown stains. And the worst part is that the toilet didnt come with a bidet. Even my gym has a bidet!!! So disappointing especially when you expect so much from a well known hotel. Oh well. Never again!",Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Nothing special,Breakfast, Club lounge, location,The ovation of this hotel is perfect. We had asked the hotel to transfer us from the airport. We waited for an hour outside the airport in the heat whilst the hotel agent told us the ride will be only '5 minutes away'. The traffic in Manila is horrendous but surely the hotel is aware of that situation and should have managed it better. The room we were shown to smelled of damp so I asked to be moved. The new room smelt less of damp though a faint whiff was still there. The decor of the rooms is a little tired. The room was on an Executive Floor with the club lounge a few steps above us. The lounge had great views and the breakfast was very good. We had a drink in the Sage bar and my friend signed the bill off for our room. After I had gone to bed, I received a phone call from the bar to say that I needed to come down to sign the bill as the room was booked in my name. I thought this was unnecessary as I hadn't clearly disputed the bar bill.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"over the weekend birthday celeb,The staff are very accommodating; the room is spacious, clean & quiet. Nice location.,It was a very pleasant stay. The hotel staff are all accomodating.

"Shangri la honeymoon stay,glamorous, good location, and comfort,Overall the room was good except we took an afternoon nap and a hotel employee kept ringing the room doorbell when we were asleep then eventually tried to enter the room when we were stirring awake cos of all the noise, luckily we had the door bolt across so they couldnt enter we heard a muffled sorry but it still rattled us big time. The restaurant downstairs is dated and food is large on rice and noodles but very low on the meat and very expensive for below average food. The breakfast was below average with cold food ans some food looked like it had been brought out for its second day as it had that dried out look. Food was very disappointing but the hotel rooms and lobby were very nice.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Fading charm but excellent staff,Comfortable beds; helpful staff; location next to the Greenbelt,For nearly $300/night, I expected that the rooms would be better maintained. I was disappointed that they were in need of updating. My fridge leaked and the entire room reeked of mould, which the hotel ""fixed"" by sending an air filter to my room. However, despite being let down by the room itself, all my interactions with hotel staff met or exceeded my expectations; all the staff were top quality in terms of helpfulness and anticipating my needs. If the rooms were updated and not stinky I would stay here again,,otherwise is try a different hotel. I wish the rooms were as impressive as the staff/help.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"Had a few issues but manager resolved them,Location was great, polite staff, great manager,I had a few issues that I raised to the duty manager via email and they were able to straighten things out within a few minutes. The guest service manager even approached me personally during check out to apologize and even provided complimentary transportation for me which I really appreciate. Their reservations team responded to me just a few hours after I booked the room for an inquiry/request I made for an early check-in, something that I don't really get from other big hotels. The location was great. Shopping malls and restaurants were just walking distance. The Ayala Triangle, where I jogged in the morning, was also just a few meters away. As always, Makati is a safe place to stay because of tight security. Maybe I was just not appreciative that day but looking back at it, most members of the staff were really polite and approachable. Amenities were just the usual.",Staff:Location
"Disappointing . Overpriced , poor value for money ,Surroundings. Apart from that , it was disappointing . There is not even a bar there .!!,Poor . Thewre was not even a bar in the hotel .

"Usually lovely....this time a bit disappointing,great location,This is a wonderful hotel and I have stayed before. I think the problem was that I booked very late on the same day for a Deluxe King, non-smoking. I checked in very late and the room I got had two double-beds and smelled faintly of smoke.......honestly I could not be bother to contact staff. This is a highly rated hotel, but I guess caution is booking early, checking in during the day with plenty of time to change rooms. Still, management or staff should have alerted me that what I purchased through Agoda was not available and should give me some credit...this is not a low rent establishment.",Staff:Cleanliness
"Great hotel - check in was appalling,Typical shangrila,Having booked the room through Agoda i had mistakenly left the guest count as 1 but had added notes for the hotel this was our honeymoon. When we arrived to checkin, the reception staff referred to my wife as ""my friend"" (looking down her nose at ""my friend"" and also referred to the booking being invalid as it incurrs extra cost. I mentioned the number of guys that bring working girls into the hotel and she said that didnt happen (but two walked past at the time of check in). Eventually she allowed us to check in as she said the hotel would incurr the cost (assume the cost was for an extra towel) and in the room was a bottle of wine and wedding cake - which was wonderful. The front desk staff should have used initiative, common sense and diplomacy - great hotel let down through poor training.",Staff
"Hasn't changed, still the only choice in Manila,Location, old standby,If you have been staying here for 20 years like I have, expect exactly the same as always. They haven't built a new hotel in Manila for 20 years, so you pretty much have to stay here. Again. Same bar, same lobby, same menu, same rooms. Only difference is that it's about double the price it was 10 years ago. I wouldn't recommend anywhere else, so you might as well stay here. Again.",Location:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

If you like good food this is the hotel for you. The buffet is the second best in Manila. Plus their are good restaurants as well.

"Stay at the Shangri La Makati,The service was very good. The room was well laid out. The bathroom was good. Internet was free. Horizon lounge is excellent.,There is only one chair in the room. There should be another. The emergency sign on floor 21 was pointing the wrong way......! Expensive.,I stayed over Valentine weekend. The hotel was very busy (full) but the service was still good. The check-in took a little longer than I would have liked but I was taking 3 rooms, and with the hotel being full, it took some arranging. In the end the rooms were upgraded so worth the wait. I had lunch in the Circle's Event Cafe for two lunches. There is an excellent buffet which covers most types of cuisine. I love spicy food and was very happy with the Indian dishes presented. Ordering drinks took a little longer than it should but, again, the restaurant was very busy. I am pleased to say the bill came quickly when requested. On Valentine's night my wife any myself dinned in the Japanese restaurant, Inagiku. Again it was a buffet meal with a free glass of Moet Champaign. There was a large selection with a lot of the dishes being cooked while you wait. The whole atmosphere is very Japanese apart from sitting at normal height tables. Recommended. The things that should be improved. The room was good but only had one chair. There should be two. I noticed that an emergency escape sign on the 21st floor pointed the wrong way. To make it more confusing there was two signs. One at ceiling level which pointed the right way, and one at floor level that pointed the wrong way.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
