"Clean, friendly, but pool was dirty and too much fees and charge for facilities for guests,Staff were nice. Nice location and the place was clean. except that the pool was moldy and had algae on the boundaries in between sections of the pool.,I like the location the staffs were friendly but I didn't like the fact that they charge so much with amenities. Like, I had guests that I wanted to treat them at the pool. Just the use of pool would they make me pay 3,500 per person which was outrageous. I booked at the Hyatt in Hawaii and being able to use their pool with my guest would not charge me any fees. I have to pay extra for my 3 yr old son to use the kids facility. I mean, we are guests at the hotel. We paid for our stay. I'm expecting that they would offer amenities for my child to enjoy his stay not just me and my parents. it's like paying for a fee for so we can utilize their facility.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

Food was OK but seldom excited - some strange anomalies - e.g. bacon sandwiches with no bacon. Much of the food seemed dried out as if it had been prepared well in advance. 2.

"Great family vacation at Shangrila Mactan,We travelled with our 7 year old son and stayed for 2 nights. It was our 2nd time to visit the resort but our first time with our son. I was happy to see they had the kiddie splash zone, the adventure zone, timezone. We also observed that t here were new corals planted in the cove which explains why we saw a lot more species of fish this time. We stayed in the main wing and had a room facing the ocean. Our room and facilities were kept spotless. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet a lot and we got to try the Italian restaurant, Dimsum restaurant, as well as the burgers at the bar by the pool. We didn't have to leave the resort to find good food. We would gladly visit again in the future.",Food:Location

"Musty Old place,It's an old musty hotel that's in dire need of a revamp. The beach is filled with sharp rocks and requires a life vest during high tide even if you're just a few feet away from the shoreline! They have an exclusive pool for some patrons in a certain block which is discriminating at this day and age-- dinner was decent but it came with a high price.. P2,500 per person to be exact.

"Incredibly overpriced for what you get.,It‚Äôs a very nice hotel, staff are wonderful, and location is ok, with the exception of a tiny beach area. The issue I had was the cost of the food. Considering that excellent Filipino food can be had anywhere around, the price for a buffet was outrageous. Between that and taxes I ended up paying almost double my room rate for what I consider to be less of a resort and more of a very nice hotel.",Value for money:Food:Location

"Overrated,Never prefer Shangrila over other hotel chains. But it was the only 5 star hotel in the area, so we gave it a try. It was a disappointment as expected. We booked a room with sea view, and were given one far from it. Totally not worth it, and it costed USD 350.

"I‚Äôd love to go back soon!,Although Shangri-La‚Äôs Mactan Resort and Spa is huge, the staff made you feel like you were cared for as an individual. There was just a period when it was hard to get poolside service, but the service at all other times was stellar. I loved the blending of indoor and outdoor spaces, which contributed a lot to the tropical resort feels. There‚Äôs quite enough space on the property that it didn‚Äôt feel crowded even though the hotel was fully booked during our stay. We stayed for two nights and that wasn‚Äôt enough time to use all of the amenities. It probably did not help that the room was so restful that you really didn‚Äôt want to leave it.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"It‚Äôs my 4th visit,I‚Äôve been there 4x in the last 5years. The location is perfect since you avoid the city traffic going to the resort. It only takes around 15-20mins coming from airport. Service and food is as expected from a big name hotel chain. In terms of facilities, 90% are still the same from my first visit. I think they need to add new things to see/do... On my recent visit, I tried to request for an early check-in. Reasonably, they werent able to give it since the hotel was fully booked. However, what I didnt like is that my room wasn‚Äôt ready until 3PM (an hour after the posted check in time). Hopefully, it will be a better visit next time...",Staff:Location

We would definitely go back again!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Good,Beautiful hotel with nice ocean view, we booked the ocean wing room. Clean big room, extra comfy bed. The hotel is isolated so you need taxi and a good 15' drive to the closest restaurants in Lapu lapu city. Inside the hotel there are a lot of restaurants to fulfill every need, some of them a little over prized. One thing you should definitely try is snorkeling as the coral bay in front offers you a wonderful experience.,One thing you should be aware of this hotel is the hidden charges that they apply. For example my husband had a mild headache so we asked for 2 tabs of paracetamol. Upon check out we realized that they charged us for doctor consultation as well without any further notice... Further more we gave 3 t-shirts for laundry and they charged 20 USD...just to inform you, any other laundry in the area charges 2 USD for 1 kilo of clothes. We totally understand that we booked a 5 star hotel for our vacation but come on guys...we already payed more than enough to bear with ridiculous and hidden charges.",Value for money:Location:Food

"Choose another Shangri La as this location makes you feel trapped,It's a beautiful hotel. Room was comfortable. The beach is very nice. Water sports are good.,We felt trapped in the hotel. You could not walk along the beach and there was no pavement at the front of the hotel so you couldn't leave on foot to walk anywhere. There must be a huge security problem as there were literally loads of security guards and the hotel owned at least 3 'sniffer' dogs who patrolled the hotel checking cars. It all made us feel like we were in a dangerous place. The hotel was very crowded. The Tides restaurant was closed for most of our stay so food choices were limited. The fish restaurant was only OK - not very good and frankly we were totally fed up with buffets after a few days. Luckily we found on Trip Advisor a much nicer restaurant only 5 mins away by car. Cebu seemed a quite dangerous and boring place to us.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

There are some free activities like hotel garden tour, snorkelling camp, etc available. We went to an excursion for snorkelling, and enjoyed it at deeper sea than private beach.

There are massive pools surrounded by an enormous garden that‚Äôs been taken care of so well. Although old furniture and corridor carpet could be improved. Staff in the kitchen/restaurant and reception/check-in desk were so helpful, accomodating and polite. Varieties of excellent food but not too many choices for allergy children (dairy and nuts allergy). The beach is nice but not for small children. Other services which demand staff were slightly slow and there‚Äôs a bit of waiting time. It's most likely due to the size of the resort and the large number of clients.

Food was also easily available within the resort, but they can be pricey. The Chinese restaurant particularly was average and not worth the price you're paying.

"Excellent resort for a get-away,Excellent service of all staff members; friendly, polite and attentive delivering service with a smile. Quality of food is of a high-quality; both breakfast and dinner. The best breakfast spread we have encountered. Although being a large property, we did not feel that this was a disadvantage. The service was still personal and we did not encounter any problems with queue for breakfast or sunbeds not being available. Comfortable sunbeds and beautiful well-maintained beach (although not overly large). Nice touches: personal greeted and welcome drink upon arrival. Airport and city shuttle, although chargeable. Ability to use hotel's facilities prior to official check-in/after official check-out including shower facilities in gym. The distance to the airport is just 15 minutes.,Sometimes difficult to get local taxi at the hotel. Request for king-size bed was not honored. During rush-hours, queue at reception. Could have given a small treat during turn-down service. Called Housekeeping twice for replenishment of water; however, nobody came. Difficult to swim during low-tide. Many families with children; if you're looking for a romantic get-away, take this into consideration.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Disappointing,sea is amazing, location of the hotel is wonderful. Personnel is always ready to help and assist.,Overpriced and quite low quality food in restaurants. When you pay that much, you expect high standard. However is seems like they are really spoiling the good food with their style of cooking. The choice is huge, but in the last days of our stay we were feeling like there is nothing to eat. Choice and quality of wine is also very poor. Getting a seat in the dining areas was challenging, every single day we had to wait in a queue to get our breakfast. We had a strong feeling that the hotel's facilities cannot accommodate that number of guests. Hotel itself is very old, our room wasn't renovated for a long time (e.g. old paint stains on the ceiling), especially the bathroom. Worth noticing, the cold water supply was poorly functioning either, so taking a shower was a disaster. That's a big shame on Shangri-La which positions itself as premium hotel chain. The beach is clean and well maintained, but it was an everyday challenge to get the lounger as the staff is not controlling situation properly (e.g. a lot of guests simply put their stuff on the loungers and leave the beach for several hours). I booked Chi-spa for Shiatsu massage but upon my arrival (not prior) it was discovered that the pool was out of water, they didn't offer any complementary bonus for not receiving the service i booked. If you decide to go for Parasailing or any other water activities the hotel is offering and order the paid photo service be sure to check the settings in their camera. Our parasailing was disappointing as they made photos in lowest quality 640x480 resolution which are not suitable even for uploading to social networks. To sum it up i would say the value you get for the price is totally not worth it. It more corresponds to cheap 4* hotel somewhere in Turkey, but not to Shangri-La premium resort.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities

First I want to point out that this property is 100% oriented towards couples and families. There is almost nothing of interest at the hotel or the surrounding area for those that come alone. Great free guided snorkeling tour and fair priced jet skis and other water toys. Staff was very nice, efficient and helpful at all times. Especially those working the beach. Security was very tight. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Lunch and dinner were lousy. I believe they have six restaurants all together. Cayree's cove has a very relaxing atmosphere. How they could screw up seafood is beyond me.The one and only alternative to the hotel for dinner is to exit the hotel grounds and walk directly across the street. Hola Espanol was excellent and fair priced. We ate there three out of the four nights of our stay. The rooms are clean and as others have mentioned old and tired. Balcony/sunset views good. $$$$$$$",Food:Location:Staff

When I have kids already this is where I will be taking them. When you are in this resort, it is hard to go out because there are literally no side walks outside of the resort in the public street.

"Tiny beach, overpriced everything, invasive ""security"" to keep out locals, poor food, bad experience,I rarely spend the time to review hotels, but this was the worst ""resort"" hotel experience I have had, especially relative to it's ""5-star"" rating. To get into the resort you need to pass thru ""security"" who scans thru the taxis to make sure you're not smuggling in guns or contraband; ridiculous. I believe the real reason for security is to give the illusion that the place is sp coal and that guests shouldn't leave the resort. This in turn allows the resort to charge outlandish prices for basic items. For example, hotel massage for $120 usd/hour (versus a much better massages at $12/hour literally right across the street). $8 Evian water in room versus $1.25 at the 7-eleven down the street. We found the security offensive, the prices offensive, and the facilities mediocre.

The food there is good, and still reasonably priced. The room is large and clean. Many performances inside. Staff is really polite. We came by walk after stay in another hotel nearby and I can say: do not try to save 20-30 dollars, go to Shangri La,There are no many things outside of research. The swimming pool was closed in the evening",Location:Value for money

"Excellent place to stay,As we know Shangri La since many years we wanted to spend some holidays with our family there. We had two rooms at the Ocean Wing. This is a great pleasure there as it is away from the general crowd and peaceful and quiet. We all enjoyed our time there especially the children had fun in the pool and on the nice clean beach. Food is a bit expensive but we still feel it is value for money and in my opinion still the best buffet dinner in town. Also in Cowry Cove we enjoyed wonderful seafood platters. All in all some great days there and this should just be repeated. An excellent place to unwind in the otherwise noisy, dirty and busy city outside.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Wandurafful staying,The view from my room was wonderful. The rooms were very large; however, it was extremely dated. The food was average at best. I was hoping for some great seafood, but was disappointed. The prices in the loppy shope was like shopping at a 7-11. The staff was incredible. They were friendly and nice. They had many suggestions for activities off the resort. I fell asleep to the sound of the crashing waves;,The only thing I dont like is that ATM in resorts wouldn't accepting debit card as well the front disk in checking out. Since they have only one ATM machine for one bank not accepting ferigen cards",Food:Value for money

"Fell in love with the beach,The beach is very nice and well-maintained. The kids enjoyed the aquaplay but I think it already needs renovation.,I booked 2 rooms and was really upset that the other one was not yet ready upon our check-in. Dinner buffet for my kid (age 5) worth almost 1300 (50% of the adult meal) is way too pricey. The hotel should have a separate menu for kids.",Food:Value for money:Location
