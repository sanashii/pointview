"My fiance and I stayed here for our Prenuptial Photoshoot.
I was looking online for a good place to have our pictures taken and nothing seemed to be the right one. Till I remembered Shangri-la Mactan, I've stayed there 2 times before with my family and all I can say is that it is great!
The beach is great, though I heard it is man made. The rooms are great. The food is great and the staff are great.
Upon reaching the hotel, I asked if they could upgrade our room. Of course, I knew it was a long shot but I was happy to find out that they agreed!
They upgraded our room for free!
The room was great, nice bathroom too!
When we needed new towels, it was just a call away.
When we went to the beach, the staff immediately brought us water and beach towels. They set up the beach chairs as well without us asking for them.
The buffet of course was just perfect, but this is always expected at Shangri-la.
If you want to find cheaper food options, you can simply take a short walk outside the resort and a lot of Korean restaurants are there, we tried one and my fiance who is a Korean said it was good. There is also a shuttle to and from the SM Mall. There was a fee though but very minimal.
Even if our stay was a third time for me, I still had a lot of fun and still really loved my stay.
The price may be a bit higher than other resort hotels but I must say that it is well worth it!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"You will feel it in the fluffiness of their towels, in the care for detail. I stayed in an ocean wing room and for the extra US$50 a night, the view was well worth it. Each room has a veranda where one could just stay soaking at the view and smoking an expensive cigar. The room amenities are great, the bed is large and relaxing, the toiletries are first class but not branded (branded as Shangrila), and there are towels everywhere (blue for relaxing in the beach, brown for the swimming pools, white for the room. You get free mangoes every morning, and a free small pitcher of mango juice once when you check-in.

Try the snorkeling. While there is a limit to how far you can snorkel, the fish is amazing, albeit there might be an occasional jellyfish or two. You can get in the water in full battle gear, flippers, snorkel, and life vest and it will just be a breeze even if you cannot swim. The swimming pools are of average 4.8 feet depth and there is one that goes to 9 feet. There is a children's playground, some video games, PS3's, two pool tables, many restaurants, some shops. Truly you wont need to leave the resort for three days if you need the vacation.

Went there towards the end of June when there was flooding rain in manila. But it was hot and humid in Cebu, perfect for soaking in the swimming pool.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We only had a couple of days to escape from a business meeting in Hong Kong, so we picked the Shang Mectan and it was no mistake.

We used transportation arranged by the hotel so it was just a breeze after arrival. Checking in was efficient. The hotel was such a beautiful property, though the room was a bit tired.

We stayed in the Ocean Club room and the service was professional yet personable. They provided mangoes every day and we just loved the smell of the tropics. The Club lounge had everything we needed and bit more.

The intimate beach was really something. Fish swim up to your feet and I didn’t even need my snorkels. The one attendant who was there had the power to read your mind and offered services at the right time. My wife still raves about the mango smoothie that was out of the world... and the food at the buffet was above average.

My wife is talking about going there for a family reunion, soon.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We stayed at the Ocean Club room for 2 nights. Would have preferred a family room but it was full. Service was generally good. Breakfast was good. Adventure Zone was excellent - an indoor play area with massive slides and obstacles for the children. Best thing was the beach - with shallow, clear water going all the way out. My sons swam in the sea, saw fish and corals. Also did the mini-golf, swimming pool slide, jet ski and kayak. There is also para-sailing facility but we didn't have time for that. It's a haven for those who wish to learn to scuba dive with lessons for children too - this we did not do. All in all there is enough to keep you entertained for a few days.

Downside:
(1) When we were there over a weekend (Fri to Sun), it was packed! There were many tourists and some locals. Children require swimming rings before being allowed down the water slide (contradicts the sign board which read no swimming aid allowed!). The hotel provides this (but you can bring your own) and they ran out of rings. Some guests were hoarding the rings despite not using them for the water slide. There should be a system to fish the rings off those who have come off the water slide and pass them back to the next load of children queueing for the slide.
(2) We couldn't get any indoor restaurant booking for seating between 7 to 8 p.m. as they were full so had to settle for 6:30 p.m.
(3) The jet skis were quickly booked up.

Bear in mind many of the rooms are under renovation at the moment. If these rooms are renovated and filled, I don't know how the hotel is able to cope at full capacity. Resources will be very stretched. The beach is lovely but small for the sheer size of the hotel.

Avoid going on weekends and peak holiday period.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"If anyone would ask me where to stay in Cebu I would recommend this hotel. Amenities, fixtures are top notch. We stayed in the newer building that's facing the sea. Nice pools plus a small but beautiful white sand beach in front of the hotel. Their spa is one of the best I've seen in the Philippines. Food although a bit pricey was good. This is no doubt one of the best in Cebu.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I am a regular at his property and this place is as you would always expect. The property is very well maintained, as expected; the rooms are superb, as expected; and the food is great, as expected. The pool and beach are clean and nice, as expected; the service is top-notched, as expected and the business center is efficient, as expected. Truly, this Shangrila property in Cebu, Philippines is as always, as you would expect from a Shangrila.

"Just minutes away from from Cebu's Mactan International Airport is Shangri-la's Mactan Resort and Spa. You'll be mesmerized with the Island's natural sand, sea and sky and man-made attractions of various proportions: the captivating beach with fine-looking fishes that wade with you along the shore, the diverse exotic structures around the island that induce relaxation and festive mood, the charming room with a scenic view.
There's a wondrous venue for every recreation you may desire, a spa, a banquet, a sport recreation, a convention, a concert. All this within the hotel's expanse. You can indulge in a wide array of scrumptious dishes, served in buffet at The Tides. Complementary airport shuttles are also available for transfers to and from the airport and/or for downtown mall visits. Enjoy the sun here from March to May.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Perfect weekend getaway from Hong Kong. The resort caters to your every need and our need was to get away from the cold Hong Kong winter during Chinese New Year (yes, I've taken quite some time to write this review!!).
The prices are hiked very high during this time, but it was so worth it. The resort is only 10 minutes away from the airport. We got in at 5am and without being an elite member, they let us check into our room...they really went out of their way to make us feel comfortable during this extremely busy time!
I am really loving the Shang's in Asia...they know how to treat their customers right and of course the Free WiFi throughout the resort is a major bonus in my book!
The breakfast area was always riddled with screaming children and a complete disaster, a tip would be to eat outside without the aircon. Most parents with kids sit inside...so if you want some peace while you eat and drink your coffee, I would suggest this.
This place really caters to families, with so many activities for the kids and even a game room! My husband and I tried our game at airhockey and pool...had some good times!
The resort has it's own Under water Marine Park, which is just fabulous. A diving platform for you to swim to and rest on. A sunken ship lies deep below for those of you diving. We saw a sea snake as well as a giant jellyfish the size of a beachball, they were both so beautiful!
The resort is so huge you really don't ever have to leave!
We did have to go stake our claim every morning for beach chairs at 7am, that's the only hassle...but otherwise, everything is perfect. The food, the service, the staff, the grounds...everything is excellent. I highly recommend this hotel to everyone.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Shangrila's Mactan Resort and Spa is world reknowned for its excellent facilities and service. The restaurants serve excellent food and their in-house spa will not disappoint the most discriminating world traveller. The staff greet guests with a big smile making one feel at home and much relaxed. What is less known is that their beach front has been declared a marine preserve. No fishing is allowed within the 5 hectare oceanfront marked clearly with white spherical buoys and patrolled by the hotel life guards. Fish and corals grow well. During high tides, snorkeling is so much fun because of plentiful fish swimming and much new growth of soft corals visible in the clear waters. My wife enjoy watching the fish go about their business. We spend hours snorkeling and swimming with the hundreds of fish some longer than 10 inches.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Moved to Shangri-La Resort from a nearby resort for last day/night in Cebu. Had dinner at Cowrie Grill - a bit pricey but great food and service. New games and activities at the beach are great for kids. However, Breeze Beach Bar's F&B and wait staff were inattentive and spent more time chatting among themselves! Hotel management may also need to provide multi-cutural training to service and front desk staff.
Overall, an enjoyable experience.",Staff:Food
"My family and I went for a short holiday to Cebu and decided on the Shangri-La. We arrived and were directed to our room. We had a bad damp smell - not gagging terrible, but bad enough to smell constantly. We called reception and they sent someone up to spray the room. After a while the smell returned and they immediately switched our rooms for us 9in a peak season when they were at capacity).

We then went down to the pool and the hotel and pool area looks like it was built in the early 80's with a refresh about mid 90's so it was definitely clean, but dated. the slide was absolutely hopeless - it was so flat my kids had to scoot half the way down!

We went to the little beach and that was excellent. With three small kids you can get into the surf with a ""guide"" and the current drags you slowly around a couple hundred metres. there are some small corals with lots of fish which the kids loved!. the service down at the beach was excellent too. the only issue (as with all resorts) is that people come down before breakfast and put a scarf or similar down on the seats and expect that to be a mark for their seat. All hotels so do a better job of policing this so it doesn't happen.

with small kids we ate relatively early and the restaurants would actually ask the chef and get us in before opening time. if they were completely booked they would let us in on the basis we would leave before the first booking and i can't tell you how much easier this made it for us.

We didn't go into Cebu and really just hung out at the beach so I can't tell you about that. If you want to hang out in a place with a decent beach with no surf a some small coral (eg, you have young kids over 2) then I would highly recommend a few days here especially during the week when it is less crowded. We really enjoyed it. if they upgraded the facilities then I would definitely head back.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"My wife, my son and daughter, and I stayed for three nights. My son had a business to tranact in the city, and we had planned a family vacation in the resort. I thought the staffs, among others, deserve some compliments; all those I encountered were actively helpful and kind. They carried towels and prepared couches on the beach, and were eager to help. With this attitude on top of the superb nature, I think I will choose this place again in similar occasions in future.",Staff
"Booked at the Shangri-La last December through a promo by Banco de Oro for its platinum card holders. Upon booking we were told by Shangri-La's Manila office that the regular beach front rooms were no longer available even though it was currently available on line. We were offered a slightly more expensive room which we accepted and we received confirmation of the promo discount that would apply. Upon check in, we were told that the discount will not apply. Apparently, despite the confirmation, we were told that the officer who booked our rooms was new. We showed the Banco de Oro flyer where it states the promo details including the duration period (which included our December travel dates ) and we were told that the promo does not apply for the month of December because it was peak season. Why then did the promo dates include December? They had no answer apart from the promo will not be apply. We thought this was unacceptable as we were already in Cebu! Every morning was spent at the front desk debating. On the last day we were told that the discount will be applied 'only because you are requesting it'. How infuriating. They do not honor their word and they say this. And because they were applying the discount we could no longer avail of the Banco de Oro discount on food & beverages.

Separately, we bumped into friends who booked (direct) much later than we did and got the regular beach front rooms at lower rates. When we asked the front desk why we were told at booking there were no more regular beach front rooms we were told that our friend's room was a different type. Our friends had the same room, directly on top of ours. We were then told that our friends booked as local residents. Banco de Oro is a local bank and they assume that its card holders are non locals? Our friends were also able to use their Banco de Oro discount on food & beverage while we were told not to.

Upon check out when asked how our stay was we briefly mentioned the incident and another lady at the front desk said that the Manila office was right, the promo applies. They tell us this the day we are leaving. We were invited to join the membership club but will need another trip to a Shangri-La hotel for the rewards to begin ... ummm another stressful vacation? We were also asked to complete an on line survey. It asks if you wish for them to contact you regarding a particular incident. I clicked yes. I have never heard from them.

It is disappointing as this was not our first stay at the resort. Apart from the booking office and front desk, the rest at the resort are very accommodating but the trouble the front desk will put you through defeats the objective of a relaxing vacation.",Staff:Value for money:Food
"we wanted to experience the first class accommodation we've been reading in this survey so we booked this hotel after our plantation bay stay.. and they delivered.

we were given mango juices when we arrived, the check in was a breeze.. they even gave us 3 card keys without us even asking for them....they anticipate our needs and we felt pampered by the staff...

my son found their food just right to his taste, however, i don't share the same sentiment as i find the buffet food at the Tides a little boring and bland...We had lunch at the tea of spring, their food was A deliciouso although servings are small and the price is quite on the expensive side...we were not able to try the open air Cowrie Grill , since lots of winged ants were all over me, even if i used insect repellant...so we dined ala carte inside the Tides. and i didn't like what i ordered, adobo chicken, it was too sour for my taste.. the amiable waiter probably wondered why i didn't seem to touch my dinner, and so he offered to give us fruit platter for free as our dessert...

they have ample pool, lounging area...game room, gym, massage spots in different parts of the garden.. overall, if price is not a problem with you, shang more than delivers, it pampers,,,",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Travelled with hubby and two toddler kids. This is definitely a kid friendly place. They have decent sized kiddie pool where kids can splash around to their hearts content. Resort has an amazing Adventure zone, an indoor padded playground for kids. Kids would have to be in socks, long pants and long sleeved shirt to use this facility so I suggest you pack this along to avoid the unnecessary purchase. Service is amazing. My kids loved it so much that they requested that we come back again. When asked to choose between HK Disneyland or Shangrila Cebu for a family vacation, they chose Shangrila Cebu!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Shangri-la because of the rate, the amenities and service. The beach may not be the best in the country but the snorkeling (with lots of lovely fish) more than make up for it.

"Shangri-La Mactan was one of the best run big resort we have ever been to. When we had no children we used to love going to tours and excursions while on vacation. However, 2 kids later our vacation style changed. We wanted a vacation where we could stay and not move too much yet still entertaining for kids. This hotel delivered!

Service was truly warm and excellent. They have one of the best kids' play center / area we have ever seen with a huge slide. Pool is also nice but the water slide was for older kids (above 5? I think) so ours could not enjoy so we hang out at the beach every day. The water was calm and we saw lots of fish. But be sure to reserve your beach chairs early in the morning during the peak season as we had many silent chair reservation battles with other guests.

Food was also of high quality, but when we were there during the peak season all the restaurants were very crowded.

Rooms are rather on small side and a bit dated. We wanted to upgrade so we saw couple of suites but they were not worth the extra money at all. We opted to spend a lot of time outside of the room instead.

All in all very enjoyable vacation spot for families.",Comfort & Facilities
"What can I say? Fine hotel - a little frayed around the edges (e.g. the TV-screen in our room had a large blue manufacturing error). But who's to quibble: it's wonderful all around. Beautiful expansive grounds with a small golf course; very long beach. The gardens are extremely well-kept and beautifully colorful. Fantastic restaurants (among which Acqua and Cowrie Cove are absolutely tops with the finest foods and meticulous service). Tides, the breakfast place, has an incredible spread!
Our deluxe room with sea-view was spacious and comfortable; the turn-down and cleaning service was efficient and thorough. Good darkening curtains; roomy balcony. Comfortable beds.

"We were a family of 5 adults staying in 2 connecting rooms & we totally enjoyed our three night stay. This is the second year in a row that my wife & I have stayed here. The hotel is located in a quiet secluded part of Lapu-lapu, close enough to the airport (about twenty minutes), yet far enough to avoid all the noise. The breakfast buffet (included) was tremendous, lots of selection, from Asian cuisine (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino) to continental fare. The beach is small but very private & very well maintained. Seaweeds washed ashore were quickly picked up by the grounds crew who worked tirelessly under the blazing sun. Overall, the Mactan Shang deserves all the accolades that they receive. the only discomfort we experienced was that the pool temperature was a little too warm, but that's just nitpicking.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"The Shangri La Mactan is truly a resort for a perfect getaway for a long weekend. The resort offers something for everyone , right from toddlers to young children to adults. The swimming pools and other leisure facilities are excellent. They have a good beach , though it may appear smaller one for those who are expecting a Phuket/Boracay kind of beach stretch .

The location was great - only 15 minutes from the airport.

"Fantastic resort with the best snorkeling ive ever done in my life. the beach is so clean and wide and the water is transparent like in a fake photograph. The best thing about the resort is the beach, the food and the employees who are a true reflection of what filipinos are like.Kind and skilled people! The only thing is that the rooms need updating as not really up to Shangri La standards. The other thing is that there are toooo many children!!! 80 % of the population is young couples with babies. I have to say though, they were all well behaved Korean kids and uber cute, so not that bad!
Apart from that, book this place if you want the best views and snorkel whilst having the most gorgeous food at affordable prices.",Location
I booked our stay for our wedding anniversary. I used our mileage from asiamiles for our hotel room. I called in my reservation and it was reservation from Malaysia who booked us in. After I got a confirmation online and viewing the rooms I decided to upgrade our room so I called again the reservation officer from Malaysia and he was so very helpful. He told me he has to call Shangrila Cebu first if I can upgrade and will let me know. I got an email confirming my upgrade and I will just have to pay the difference from standard room to family room. During our check-in I was a bit late and my husband was ahead of me as I was still packing up for our trip to Leyte after we check out. The receptionists were so helpful and accomodating to my husband. They helped him even if I was not there yet. The room was registered under my name. They suggested to us if we want to upgrade to an access to executive lounge with just an additional amount and we were glad we did. For our 2 days stay with food and upgrade to executive lounge and family room we only paid around $300. The staff are so very nice and a cake with a greetings for our wedding anniversary was delivered to our room complimentary from the executive lounge staff. We had an awesome dinner buffet by the beach. My kids really enjoyed it and we are planning to go back again next year.

"My husband and I had our wedding celebration at the Shangri-la hotel, and were so glad we did. Having to plan a wedding is stressful enough, but we were planning one halfway around the world! Coleen, the events planner, was a gem, really taking care of our needs and putting us in touch with the right people to pull our plans together. We didn't hire a wedding coordinator since she took on a lot of the responsibility. Our guests who stayed at the hotel for the first time were very impressed by the level of service. They commented that every hotel employee they met greeted them and were quick to answer questions or help. Some of our guests booked return stays before they left.

Our wedding package included two nights in one of the Ocean Wing suites and a two-hour spa treatment. That spa treatment was the best I've experienced so far. A body scrub, milk bath and massage was definitely what we needed. Me and Mr. S had our own private villa and the most relaxing experience after months of worry and stress over how everything would come together.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"If you are looking for a great holiday with kids then this is the place. The facilities are absolutely outstanding from numerous pools, well stocked gym, kids club, beach, lawns etc. The staff are exceptionally helpful and friendly and even though the hotel is enormous you don't feel overcrowded.
Where this hotel lets itself down is on rooms in the main wing. Although nice, I would certainly not rate them 5 star so as long as you go on with this expectation you'll be fine. I believe the Ocean Wing has rooms that have had a more recent lick of paint.
Breakfast is good but the buffet dinner at Tides was average and Cowrie Cove had a great setting but again average food.

The staff are very kind and accommodating. The rooms are spacious and if you get the ocean wing, its nicer too. The restaurants are a bit expensive but worth the money.

"I live locally before and i worked in hospitality industry too in Shangrila's best competition. I expect too much of this Resort coz i thought this is the best of everything...So i am so eager to try there with my fiance before coming here to US.

I arrived from manila same day my fiance would arrive in Cebu to see me...I was so tired from waking up so early and all the line up from the embassy and all the busy day i had. I expect that i can have my room and took a rest before my fiance would arrived. But i was mistaken I arrived late at 4pm room isn't ready yet and told me to wait forawhile while they are still preparing it. Until it is almost or past 6pm i forgot the time but i waited too long in the lobby and still so many guests there...I really wanted to lie down and close my eyes since i need a little nap.

So they upgraded our room but i thought everything is ok until the day of our checkout were waiting for the bus in going to the airport on our way to boracay but we left the hotel more dissapointed coz the front desk promised us to let us know when the shuttle arrives but never call us to let us know we need to find it ourselves...

P..S. when i checked in they lost my luggage and they couldn't find it and so i cant took a bath and change my clothes but their able to trace it before i will go to the airport to pick him up.

Aside for the bad service we experienced everything is great, location kind of far from cebu city but mactan area is for beach...they have lots of choices for the restaurant and have a night shows too for filipino cultural dances...Their buffet restaurant is so great their is no time when u will stop eating its up to you when to stop its expensive but well worth it...

"Easily the nicest resort in Mactan. The beach is second to none, the pool is beautiful, and the staff is incredibly friendly, the rooms are incredibly nice, and they all have free wireless in every room.

That said, I started my trip at Shangri-la and during my month in the Philippines, found you can get similar Shangri-la service/amenities at numerous locations in Cebu for a fraction of the price. Shangri-la is a place that cators to westerners, and they charge you western prices for bed, drinks, and food that are 4 or 5 times what you pay elsewhere in Cebu. For example, a San Miguel beer at Shangri-la will cost you 200 pesos, or about $5. The Westerner in me thinks, ""wow that's a good deal for a fancy resort like this"". It isn't until you leave your bubble at Shangr-la and realize the normal price for a San Miguel is usually 20-30 pesos (50 to 75 cents), and even at up-scale eateries in Cebu City is only 50 pesos.

So all in all, Shangri-la is a fantastic place and comprable to any Western resort. It's a great place for a short stay, but if visiting the Philippines or Cebu City, is far removed from a true Filipino/Cebuano experience, and it will cost you a pretty penny.",Value for money:Location:Food
"We had read all the reviews and even had some friends recommend this hotel but it was very average for a 5 star resort, which was very disappointing given we had just stayed in the Shangri-La in Makarti.

Main gripes:
It' s really noisy, from 6am the steady parade of doors slamming and people yelling up the corridors begins, we could hear our neighbors banging around next to us at all hours of the day and night.

The breakfast buffet, firstly the selection was very uninspiring and if you got there after 8am there was only the dregs left. The staff could simply not refill it fast enough. Every morning we would have to ask 3 or 4 times before our coffee would arrive. We had the Sam experience at the dinner buffet.

It is a shame, great location and friendly staff but let down by poor management. For the 5 star price, I expect more, save your peso's and head somewhere else!",Staff:Food:Value for money
"We stayed in the Club Floor and were therefore entitled to the free shuttle bus service. The process took longer than we expected and we sat on the bus wishing we had taken a private car. Seats are extremely narrow and the bus is very very compact ! Next time we'll pay the extra and have the hotel Car pick us up.

Despite this we were greeted with a welcome drink on arrival and the checkin was quite straight forward. The rooms were spacious and clean and of the standard you would expect from the Shang. Our first night we had a partial sea view room and we requested to change rooms to a full sea view. This room was a significant improvement, having the full ocean view and increased space on the balcony made a huge difference. The food in the lounge was very good although be warned we witnessed that they shut on the dot.
Amenities are L'occitaine for those of you wondering. Service was excellent as you would expect and you are addressed by name. Strongly advise you to book early at the restaurants, they tend to get very busy especially during holiday periods. If you fancy a massage which doesn't cost the earth, try Marina Mall which is a local mall (30 mins from hotel) Ace Massage - don't expect the luxury of the shang though, far from it, but, it will cost you around 400 peso that's around 6 GBP or 70 HKD) very cheap, expect them to give you a tatty looking tip envelope at the end of your treatment. Regarding tip... usually 100 peso tip is satisfactory. If the DVD selection at the Hotel is somewhat dated and ""gone with the wind"" isn't your thing inside the Marina Mall you'll find a few ""dvd"" shops and you can try before you buy !!

Taxi back will be around 120 - 150 peso.

"we just came back from 9 nights in shangrila mactan and spend new year there with my 2 kids and my husband.it was our first time in cebu.
GOOD THING ABOUT THIS HOTEL-
kids are free for buffet breakfast,lunch and dinner
theres a golf coures inside of hotel
good service and good staff
feeding the fish at the beach (kids loved it)
paying 100 pesos one way going to the mall for shopping is good for mommy.and ask them time table for the shuttle bus(its worth it) buying handicraft in kulutura filipino are fantastic located at SM Mall
next time we go back,we better take cathay pacific via hongkong rather than Pal(not convienient travelling with kids Via manila)not organize for transit.as we live in shnaghai",Food:Location:Staff
"Everything you would expect from a Shangri La, great location right on the beach front, exceptionally friendly and polite staff, fabulous facilities and food all bonded together with lovely weather.

The beach here is lovely with tropical fish swimming in the sea even near the shore. The pool is great for kids with a slide and all the restaurants are geared up to accomodate children also. There is an adults only bar and spa (with pool) for those wishing to get away from the kids.

Even at Christmas when the hotel was at full occupancy, there was a lways a sun lounger free and you were able to get a table at the restaurant of your choosing for dinner.

Really hope to go back soon.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
We went to Cebu for a 4 day trip to relax. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. The Hotel has two pools and a lovely beach. The snorkeling was fantastic. To get tricked into buying a snorkeling package. You can easily swim to the snorkeling area yourself without paying money for it. The Hotel rooms are quite old and could do with an update and some renovation work. The size of the rooms is good though. The spa is great and the setting amazing. Alltogether a nice stay but be aware that the charges are very high. It was not a cheap stay for our four days. In my opinion the food/drinks etc is overpriced for what you get.,Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Have been a big fan of Shangri-La for many years but this was my first time staying at Mactan. It was everything I expected and more. The resort is fantastic for ""rest and relaxation"" as well as ""fun and advdenture"" for the entire family. I have often stated the buffet at this chain is the best I ever ate and this hotel was no exception. The Head Chef paid attention to every detail in setting up this marvel and even came to my table delivering the most mouth watering prime rib. The 4 night stay was fantastic and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",Food
"Stayed here recently with my young son. After hearing plenty of good reviews by word of mouth, we decided to give it a try for 5 nights. One of the big pluses is that if you are traveling from Hong Kong, you can get a flight in the morning and be having lunch by the pool. It's convenient and easy if you need a quick getaway.

Pluses:

The staff are incredibly friendly. Every single staff member we came across conveyed a smile and a friendly greeting, every single time. Without fail.
The pools are enormous and kids will have a ball on the waterslide.
The e-zone area is quite good to kill 30-40 minutes of time playing video games, pool and air-hockey.
The adventure zone is good for the kids to let off some steam when they've had enough of swimming.
The variety of food at the breakfast buffets is extensive, although it can get a little busy and crowded at peak times (but the pancakes are worth the wait).
The food at the Cowrie Cove restaurant was top quality, even if it was expensive by western standards (and outrageous by local Filipino standards).
The bed was extremely comfortable.

Minuses:

The hotel itself is looking a bit tired and for a 5 star resort could be ""slicker"" around the edges.
The golf course is not much more than a pitch and putt for 30 minutes and is expensive for what you get.
The TV was an old CRT job and you'd think in this day and age that a standard flat screen would be easy to organise.

We organised our trip through a travel agent and I would highly recommend booking a stay here this way, as opposed to booking it off their website. We ended up getting breakfast daily, a buffet dinner for one night, free use of the adventure zone for our kid and airport shuttle pick-up/drop-off for a much better rate than the hotel advertises for itself. Also there was some confusion at check-in as to what was included (even though it was in plain English on the voucher) and you have to sign for everything, even the breakfasts that were included in our package. This made me a bit nervous that the checkout process would be drawn out crossing off room charges for things we had already paid for, but to the staff's credit, the bill was absolutely spot-on first time.

The Shangri-la Cebu is not cheap, but for a quick and easy 4-5 night stay with your family and some friends, this can't be beat. We'll be back for sure.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Well first of all, I came for a respite from the concrete hell that is Manila and boy that's what I got. This hotel has it all, it is clean, the food is alright (I'm a picky eater so that tells you a lot), facilities are top notch especially the pools, gym, kids' playground, water sport center, game rooms (pool tables, video games, pinball machine, etc.). AND the Beach is an absolute gem, very clean and so many colorful fishes!! My 5 year old really enjoyed the beach!! No sea urchins or jellyfish to give you a nasty surprise in the water. My only complain are the pillows they use , they are too darn soft, your head literallly disappears into the pillow when you lie on them(!), i'm not kidding (attention management!!). The mattresses are a bit stiff also. But overall our stay is A-OK!!
P.S. A shout out to Lovely, the Ocean Wing desk officer who really assisted me in my questions and other trivial stuff. She is just what her name says!!",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"The hotel is very large, and has a compound feel. We never left the grounds except for dinner one night because there isn't very much around within walking distance. There were a lot of families with small children and the pool chairs and chaise lounges tended to fill up pretty early in the morning.

Our room was fine, we liked the huge buffet breakfast, but overall it was pretty average and the hotel seemed like it needed a bit of renovation.

The service at the buffet breakfast and restaurants were good, but I didn't like the leering of the male staff almost every time one passed me by, and the staff around the pool and the beaches didn't seem very bothered about helping us find a chair or get towels.

The charge for the wake boarding was pretty expensive, and they ended up charging us more than we thought we had agreed upon and the on the way back to shore, the instructor reminded us several times that the tip wasn't included in the price.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"Hotel can feel a bit isolated, but it the property is expansive and beautiful. With a great gym, some amazing swimming pools, and its own beach, the property offers amazing convenience. Staff were consistently professional and attentive.

My only gripe is that breakfast can be very crowded. The staff members do their best to keep up, but when most rooms are full, the breakfast rush is a real onslaught of people. That said, poolside restaurants offered excellent service and delicious food for other meals.

Hotel is near the airport, near Lapu-Lapu site, a short walk from ferries to other islands, and a reasonable taxi ride into town. Shuttles are available into shopping centres and to the airport.

Would I return? Absolutely! This is a nice hotel for a relaxing, splurge weekend away.",Food:Location
"Stayed here in March 2009. Choose Shangri La as it appears to be one of the nicest big scale resort in Cebu.

Lots of activites to offer - mini golf (i was thrilled since i'm not a golfer but still got to try golfing by the beach which was nice), snorkelling right at the beach (although we did plan a separate snorkelling trip) which was really convenient. Kayaking was superb as r got to see so much tropical fish thanks to superb water clarity. Food was nice too - husband and i ate our hearts out with the very extensive buffet spread despite eating only seafood (as we take only kosher meat) so that was really great.

Saw many familiies enjoying with their children since there are indoor kids activities as well. Ideal location for families. For couples - you may want to request for quiter rooms, as our rooms was just right across the swimming pool and found it noisy despite being many floors above ground.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I've stayed here five times in the past 11 years and have always been very satisfied each time. Over the years they have continued to improve the facilities while maintaining a high standard of service and quality of food.

"This is my 4th time to the Shangrila Mactan Cebu and it's as good as it's ever been. I came with my two children, 7 and 5 and as always the kids club was exceptional, they couldn't wait to get in there. A tip though, the kids need long sleeves and socks to use the fantastic indoor playroom with sack slides and a huge drop slide, and of course plenty of climbing/swinging playing areas. There is a specific zone for under 3's so it's a bit safer and quieter. They also have various activiites on each day and my kids made t'shirt's, photo frames, necklaces and enjoyed a dinner party they have at kids club every Sat night with games/movies/prizes/dinner etc. The staff are so wonderful with the kids and there was a gentleman called Mark, who even remembered the kids from last time - they were all amazing with them.

I would suggest the best deal is going directly through the hotel, I spent ages looking online and the hotel reservations were the best out of all of them. We stayed in room 8005 overlooking the pools/sea and the view is exceptional. Bedding was king size plus pull out sofa bed - more than enough room for a family of 4. The Ocean Club rooms are the best we've stayed in, for view, value for money and service. YOu get the use of the Ocean Club Lounge which you can use anytime of the day for snacks/drinks, great for breakfast when it's full of people, cocktails and hot snacks between 5-7 and you can go up anytime during the day to get a drink and small snacks. You also get priority checkin/out of the hotel in the lounge and as they couldn't accommodate a late checkout (our flight was not until 8pm)...we were extended until the last possible minute (3pm) and we're now sitting in the lounge, kids are watching disney channel while I""m sipping a cup of tea. We will get some room service here before we get taken to the airport.

Only had one hiccup with the bill and it was meant to be an American Express deal where you pay 2 nights, 1 night free. After much discussions and speaking with the reservation person that I had dealt with, they refunded a night after insisting I was going to have to pay for all 4 nights. They were very gracious in accepting responsibility for the mis-communication between myself and the reservations manager.

The beach is beautiful, you can feed the fish right off the beach out of your hands with bread supplied at the beach. The snorkelling is fantastic right off the beach as well and the great thing about staying in the Ocean Club Room is that all non-motorised eqiupment is free, ie. snorkel sets, kayaks, windsurfers. There are plenty of gorgeous beach lounges under umbrellas for shade and the staff are always on hand to give you advice on what the fish are that you've seen, dry towels, any food/drink etc. ON our last day here the hotel was 100% full and I did notice a difference in the amount of people of the beach vying for a spot under shade. A little tip is to go down before breakfast and place towels and a few magazines etc on the lounge chairs that you want, yes I know that really annoys people but you have to if you want a good spot. You can also ring down to the beach and they will reserve a spot with towels for you if you know exactly where you want to sit.

The main kids pool has a new waterslide with round floater rings to go down - the kids loved it, but it does get congested with kids and floaties.

The best places to eat for the kids is at Aqua by the second pool (closest to the beach)...I've only just realised that after having lunch there today. You can choose off the kids menu, but they give you a huge serving of pasta (this is the only thing we ordered) and they both couldn't finish it, whereas eating from the kids menu anywhere else they got a tiny portion and nowhere near as nice. I only had dinner twice out here as I was quite full up on the hot snacks in the ocean club lounge and I just ordered the kids meals from the kids menu. Try the banana smoothies - amazing!!

It really is a fantastic place for a 3-5 nights, anymore than that and I think you'd like to get out and about somewhere.

The service was fantastic, everyone around the hotel always had a smile and a friendly greeting to me and the kids and you really get the feeling that they are there for anything you need.

I will definitely be coming back for another visit and will be counting down the days!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"This is a great hotel,expensive but good value. Buffet breakfast comes with the room.
Service was superb... They also have free shuttle from and To Cebu city proper.

Chi SPA is super nice, its one of the best SPA i tired besides Mandala Spa(Boracay).

"For me, Shangri la Mactan is the best place to stay when visiting Cebu. The hotel is just gorgeous, grand lobby, three big pools,a man- \made beach and plenty of activities in and out of the hotel. Only stayed at a standard room but it was decent and all the things I needed were provided. Things I like about the hotel is they have complimentary shuttle service to the malls (like SM), which is convenient for souvenir shopping and to explore some other local restos. Also, nightlife is just a cab ride away from the hotel. The shuttle service to the airport is also very convenient. The breakfast buffet that was included in our tour package was well worth it! We also decided to book a speed boat (via hotel concierge), and went to a restaurant (not fancy but serves fresh made to order seafood) on a stilt above water. The boat ride was P4000, which was a little expensive, but worth it! The abalone and crabs are too die for!!!! Hotel staff service is not exceptional, only average. I think jetskis can also be rented.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I have been to this resort 2 years ago but back then it was only the two of us enjoying the resort like honeymooners. This time around we brought along our 1 year old kid and have a family bonding of sorts.

I'm glad we chose Shangri-La as it has a lot of things to offer, i love the fact that they have a toddler zone where my kid can play while my wife and I can have our relaxing massage at Chi or swim at beach. We were also able to eat at all of the food outlets, love the food offered at Acqua specially the parmaham with arugula pizza, also had a great lunch at Tea of Spring and a delectable buffet dinner at the Tides.

We had a deluxe sea view room which overlooks the Mactan channel and the swimming pool, my son loves the view so much that he always peek out the window to see the view of the pool. I can't say anything negative about the room since it catered to all our needs, a comfortable bed big enough for the 3 of us, complimentary water replenished everyday and a clean bathroom. The complimentary broadband is a plus as it keeps me connected online.

The staff in the resort were all helpful, they even went out of their way just to provide what we need. In one instance the server at the buffet went in the kitchen to get some congee for my kid. In another occasion, the lady at the beach assisted us by providing a shade tent like structure since there were no more shaded cabanas available. The guest relations officers were also very helpful specially with all the queries i had during our stay and i had a lot of them and all were answered with a smile.

Overall, we were very satisfied with our stay with Shangri-La's Mactan Resort and will do it again next year for another family bonding. As what is stated in their business card upon check-in ""My Residence in Cebu""",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I am two thirds done with an 11 night stay at the Shangri La Mactan. This is certainly a great resort to stay at with kids and it's not so bad for the adults either.

The Good:
* We missed our connection in Manila so arrived a day late. Shangri La didn't charge us for the missed night.
* We booked a corporate rate through our company travel agent but the rate we booked was inadvertently for one person - not a family of four. Shangri La honored our rate anyway.
* Staff are incredibly nice and friendly without fail. I never once felt like I was imposing on them when I asked for something - they always seemed more than happy to help with any request.
* Tons to do with kids in the resort - Shangri La have given this some thought for example : beach toys and water toys available at no charge and nice big cabanas providing shade on the beach for the little ones to play in. Adventure Zone, Toddler Zone, E-Zone, two swimming pools - one with slide, games, swings etc. Our twin 2 year olds are having a fantastic time.
* Shuttle service to the airport and into the city for a reasonable fee.
* Hotel restaurants, while not cheap, are priced fairly for a hotel of this class with the possible exception of the dinner buffet but since my wife and I are not buffet people (we are vegetarians for one thing) this didn't bother us. Also reasonably priced tasty kids meals available (or they eat free at the buffet if you are eating).
* Plenty of vegetarian options at the restaurants.
* Warm generally clean sea water (occasional pieces of garbage were in the water) with tons of tropical fish that you can feed and see even in waste deep water.
* Nice pizzeria right outside the resort gates for a change and some cheaper food and beer.
* The CHI spa looks amazing but we didn't partake of the services on offer there.

The Not So Good
* Location - the hotel is a long way from much of interest. I recommend an evening stroll down to the Magellan Shrine. Also Mactan Acquarium is 4kms and it's convenient to the airport but Cebu proper is close to a one hour drive away. So if you like to get out of the resort a lot this isn't a good choice.
* The hotel is just beginning to look slightly tired. Maybe the furnishings are 2/3rds of the way through their useful life and will need updateing relatively soon. Also we looked at upgrading our room but the room shown to us for the upgrade didn't smell too hot. This might just be because the door hadn't been opened in a while and it needed some fresh air. Also, our room in the Ocean Wing only had a standard bath type shower. At this price point I would have expected a dedicated walk in shower.
* I get the feeling that the amenities will be very crowded if the hotel is full so I would avoid this place at peak times. The morning breakfast buffet was extrememly busy the first few days we were there and all seats on the beach were taken by 10am. In contrast now it is not so busy and you can get beach chairs anytime.
* There are a LOT of kids here so if you don't have kids you may not find this place particularly relaxing or romantic.

Finally just a personal observation - we like to experience places and people when we travel. We have been able to do that a little here because we have some friends in Cebu who showed us around a little. On the other hand, if you come to Shangri La and stay in the resort most of the time, you are really not going to experience the Phillipines or Cebu in any meaningful way. This is the first time we have ever done a resort type hotel - it makes more sense for us now that we have little ones but with that said I'm not sure we would book into a large resort like this again. In February we booked into a boutique hotel in Vietnam and had a much better overall experience.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I'm so inlove with this place... we stayed in Shangri-La Suite and the view is just magnificent!!! Love the food and service... but i do have a complaint since most of their personnel are new (it's because the old personnel was moved to Shangri-La Boracay) it's just to be more kind, polite and SMILE!!! coz it's a must... people are their to have fun and enjoy the moment and not seeing 2 to 6 personnel not smiling or not greeting their customers. And yes i had a bad experience in one of their boutique since i love to shop... these lady seen me as i'm about to go inside the boutique (souvenir shop of the hotel)... guess what.... she NEVER say good morning ma'am or smile at me at all. I was dissapointed with her and i also found out that they were two in the counter and the other one seen me too ... but unfortunately they've got the same feather at all. And Suprisingly my husband just came in the boutique and they stood up right away to greet my husband ""good morning sir!"" and of course with a ""smile""... and again their surprised! coz the foreign customer that just came in is my husband!. After that they looked ashamed to themselves... and i didn't buy anything from that boutique. There's a lesson here ....people shouldn't under-estimate on your color of your skin nor the way you look if you are rich or not coz you'll never know what you get.

A lot of people were in the hotel though, since it was the Summer season here in the Philippines. There were a lot of tourists from nearby Asian countries like Japanese, Koreans as well as Philippine locals.

The atmosphere was beachy. The lobby is well ventilated coz it is open-air. The staff is top quality and the rooms are spacious and clean. The facilities are top notch and they have lots of swimming areas aside from the beach. The beach is clean and the sand is fine and warm. The hotel offers some outdoor and/or water activities but it comes with an additional fee. It's a bit overpriced, but since we were on vacation, we just paid for it.

I think the resort is way too big, however, all the amenities are very useful (i.e., the business center, atm machine, child care).

"*** Must Read if looking for a Wedding Venue in Cebu***
We visited Cebu in June 2009 looking for a wedding venue for our big day in June 2010. There was no doubt that Shangri La Mactan was the best choice and no resort even came close! The resort is breathtakingly beautiful, a tropical paradise. Manicured gardens welcome you to the main building. It shows the Shang are proud of their establishment.
We set up an appointment with Coleen Rosario, the Events Manager. From the very beginning, she was very accommodating, pleasant to deal with and genuinely helpful. Our luggage got lost from Melbourne to Manila and with Coleen's help, they found our luggage and got it delivered to the Shangri La later that night even though we weren't staying there.
Coleen gave us a tour of the Ocean Pavilion and straight away we fell in love! We didn't even bother with seeing the other resorts, we were already sold on the the Shangri La.
We kept in touch over email and Coleen made the whole planning process a stressfree and pleasant experience. She was always so efficient with her replies and I really loved her can do attitude!
1 year later, we found ourselves checking in to the resort 1 week before the big day to finalise all the details for the wedding. For the 3nights of the weekend before the wedding, we were ecstatic to learn Coleen had upgraded us to an Executive Suite in the Main building. It was such a nice start to our holiday!
The room was huge with a king bed and separate lounge room. The bathroom had a bathtub and separate bathroom with L'Occitane products.
Next day we ventured around the resort. We were greeted by everyone from housekeeping, to grounds staff, to the gardeners. We felt to welcome and were treated like VIPs.
The facilities are amazing and so well maintained. We had breakfast at Aqua which is in the Ocean Wing and less busy than Tides in the Main building. The buffet breakfast was the best we've had! A good selection of western and filipino breakfast, plus some japanese/asian selections and lots of fruits and pastries/muffins.
The smaller pool near the Ocean Wing overlooks the beachfront and is great for those wanting a bit of privacy away from the families in the main pool. The beach was beautiful with plenty of sun lounges, fine powedery sand, clear blue water and plenty of fish swimming close to the shore. Snorkeling was inexpensive, about P300 for gear hire as long as you want which was worth it because there was an awesome array of fish in the water.
My husband is a kid at heart so the games room was his retreat with plenty of games (pinball machines, table hockey & billiards) and separate Timezone area with arcade games. I didn't mind because there were plenty of computers for me to use with free internet access, perfect for keeping in touch with family and friends coming to the wedding.
Our Chi Spa was unforgettable! From the outside, the Chi Spa looks small but it's actually heaven on earth over 10 hectares! There are 7 couples villas and 8 singles villas where you can get pampered and escape the daily grind! We had a 2hr package with foot bath, full body scrub, soak in outdoor bath & full body massage. A truly luxurious and relaxing experience.
The next weekend we stayed 2nights in a Panorama Suite in the Ocean Wing which is part of the wedding package. It was massive! Almost double the size of the Executive Suite with entrance foyer, separate living/dining area, huge bathroom and roomy balcony with picture perfect sea views! It was the perfect place to get ready for the big day with enough room for the make up artist, hair stylist, wedding coordinator, photographers, videographers, plus all their assistants and 3 bridesmaids and 2 mothers!
The Ocean Pavilion was like a dream and the Mactan Ballroom was enchanting. My guests are still talking about the wedding and how perfect everything was, down to the atmosphere, the beauty of the Shang and the delicious buffet dinner. Some say it's the best buffet dinner they've had! And there was plenty of left over food!
We provided accommodation at The Shangri La for all our guests from Australia, USA, Dumaguete, Bacolod and Manila. Everyone enjoyed the whole experience from the wedding, to the resort facilities, the accommodation and the breakfasts and airport transfers.
It was the perfect wedding, it exceeded all our expectations! It is one of the more expensive options in Cebu, but if you want the best, you can rest assure that the Shang will deliver because they only do things with 110% effort which definitely makes it all worth it! One you and your guests will never forget!
Thanks to Coleen Rosario she made our dreams come true and we can't wait to come back on our anniversary next year.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"Visiting this hotel outside of the school holidays the resort had low occupancy and was a fantastic place to relax. With a beautiful beach with white coral sand and crystal clear water where colourful tropical fish swim up to the water's edge this hotel is a little piece of paradise. That said it didn't get off to a perfect start. We booked one of their family suites which are to be found in the Ocean Wing on the ground floor. Travelling with a teenager and a child aged 10 this seemed to be the best arrangement avoiding having to book two rooms, however when we entered the room it smelt damp, however we made allowances due to being in the tropics. When during the night I could feel that the sheets were actually damp the next morning I went to reception and asked to change rooms. A member of staff escorted me to a new family suite room and having opened the door and recognising immediately that this smelt damp upgraded us to an Executive room adding two single beds to the room. This room was absolutely delightful with wonderful views over the sea, a large, very comfortable double bed and an excellent modern bathroom. The holiday took off from there.

All of the staff were very friendly and thoughtful throughout our whole stay. This experience started with the professional way we were greeted at the airport (only a short distance away) all the way through when we dropped at the airport on our return. The staff could not do enough for you.

The resort is very child friendly with not only dedicated swimming pools with slides and water canons but also faciilities for the children to play in to escape the heat of the day. Again the staff in the children's play facility were extremely friendly and professional.

With a good choice of restaurants and bars there is really no reason to leave the resort. The food quality was good - particularly in the Italian restaurant where the chef is absolutely superb. I can honestly say that I have never had such an excellent risotto outside of Italy. Both my wife and I liked it so much that we had it two night's running.

I would highly recommend this hotel for families who want to have a relaxing time in a corner of paradise.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Hubby and I went there from May 10-16 and had a wonderful time. Staff and service were excellent. Grounds very well-maintained and felt airy. Our ocean-view room was nice and more spacious, compared to other rooms of the same type in hotels we've stayed at in the Carribean or the Mediterranean. Soft bed, high-thread count linens, spacious and very well-ventilated bathrooms made for a really comfortable stay.
Buffet breakfast at Tides was outstanding. Expect US prices in restaurants like Tea of Spring, Tides and Acqua. It is still inexpensive considering we spent $20/person (for a group of 5) for a fresh whole fish, and three other dishes, including drinks, tax and service charge! That's a good deal. Chef did a great job with the meals, never overseasoning and letting the fresh ingredient speak for itself.
If you want to save $$, you have the option to go out to Cebu island via the hotel's city shuttle (one way trip /person is about $2.50). The shuttle has drop off and pick up points at 2 major malls in Cebu where you can pick up food from restaurants or eat-in or do groceries. The malls are about 30 minutes from the resort. Tip-check if your room rate includes shuttle services.
Snorkelling was excellent. Fish come close to the shore and it's like swimming in an aquarium ten feet or so from the shore. Swim towards the pontoon for even more diverse aquatic life and corals. A word of caution: you may want to bring surf shoes as there are rocky areas to navigate. We did okay though we didn't bring any, so no major worries if u forget. Life vests are complimentary. Not sure about snorkel gear.
There's swimming pools, a game area (table tennis, billiards, badminton) near the main pool area, hammocks, a gym with free sauna, jacuzzi, steam room. Do check to see if your room rate includes free gym admission so there are no surprises on your bill.
We got 100% relaxation at the Mactan Shangri La and have only good things to say about the staff and the resort!",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I have very fond memories of this place - it was a great little family vacation. Our baby couldn't really take advantage of all the great-looking kiddie facilities, but must be great for families with slightly older children. The spa was amazing - each treatment room was its own villa. The food at the restaurants was alright and the grounds were nicely landscaped. One of the nicest surprises was the beach, which was just beautiful, with some coral and little fish to see. It was great for snorkling.

The only thing I'd criticize about the hotel is the architecture - a lot of Shangri-la hotels have the same, big block architecture which I find kind of generic and boring. There are lot sof big empty walkways, both indoors and outdoors. That said, they made up for it with some nice landscaping. The pasta at the Italian restaurant was also pretty bad - I'd recommend going for the pizza. But the view, setting and friendly service more than made up for it.

All in all a very relaxing and pleasant stay at a beautiful resort!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I stayed in the Shangri-la Mactan back in April 2009 (i've procrastinated over writing this review for long enough, haha)

Me and my wife stayed here on our honeymoon after we got married in Iloilo a few days previous. I had done the booking through email and was dealling with a girl named Maricar in the reservations who I could not fault. She always replied promtply and answered all my questions. Because it was our honeymoon we ended up going for the room upgrade to an Ocean Club room in the Ocean Wing and added on transfers between airport and hotel return also. We also added on a couples spa treatment for ourselves (again it was our honeymoon so we wanted to treat ourselves).

When we arrived at Cebu airport and got to the baggage claim there was a hotel rep there alreday waiting for us so no problem finding him or our transfer. When we had our bags he took us outside and a hotel car pulled up beside side, no waiting. Both the rep and driver had good english and very friendly.

The drive from the airport to the hotel was short, 15-20mins, perhaps it might have been cheaper to just get a taxi at the airport (although comparing the cost of the hotel pick-up to taxis back in Ireland I still felt like I was saving money anyway).

Check-in went smoothly, we arrived at reception around 10am, hotel staff took our bags and we were taken imediately up to our room and did the check-in privately in our room, this is cause we were in the Ocean Club, and our bags arrived a few mins later.

The room was really nice, big king bed, very comfortable, nice and spacious and clean with a little sofa, table with fruit and another desk with stationary in the drawers (for the business traveller), TV wasn't a flat screen so a bit old maybe, to stay more modern they might consider upgrading those, but not a deal breaker. Bathroom was smaller than expected, not tiny small, there was still lots of space, just having been in two previous shangri-la's in Muscat & Abu Dhabi which both had large bothrooms with walk-in showers and seperate bath I was expecting the same here, but there was no walk-in shower. Wasn't a big deal to us and certainly didn't effect our stay but thought it best to mention as I know some people reading this might like to know what's there. All amienties you'd expect from a 5 star were there also so no worries if you forgot your own toothbrush or toiletries.

I should also mention that the view we had from the balconey of our room was fantasitic, full seaview.

Hotel staff were all friendly, room cleaning staff even greeted us by name on our first meeting without introduction when we passed them on the way to the elevator from our room. Either they quickly learn whose in which room or maybe they had extra heads up cause we were on Honeymoon?

Hotel grounds were huge, get a good walk in going round the place. two swimming pools both really nice. One of which was an infinity pool in front of the beach. Hotel has it's own private beach, not the biggest of beach, but it was nice and lots of fish just swimming around. I got a snorkle set and just floated in the water looking at all the different fish swimming past. The gym had a nice selection of equipment if you're looking to work out. There is a games room with a small arcade and pool tables aswell as free internet stations. Aswell as may other activities. The spa treatment we had was well worth it, very relaxing and the spa area has it's own private pool too. After treatment your also given a fruit platter and juices to help further cleanse the body.

We ate our first dinner at the Tea of Spring chinese restaurant which was nice... only thing though was there was no duck on the menu which I found odd for a chinese restaurant (and it's my favourite), but I had chicken instead which was still very good. 2nd night we had a buffet dinner at the Buko Bar which also had a cultural show on that night. You have to reserve a table to get a good view of the stage, we didn't as we were out in the city that day and weren't sure if we'd be back in time but we were. Even though I didn't reserve a table once I gave our room number we were given a table right in front of the stage... not sure if it was cause of the Ocean Club room...or maybe the honeymoon but it was really good either way. 3rd night we just took advantage of our Ocean Club status and ate in the Club Lounge free snacks and cakes for our dinner haha.

Being in the Ocean Club also gives you free drinks in the Ocean club lounge. This was good though I do think they should at least extend this to include at least one free drink with your dinner at any of the restaurants as you'll likely end up paying more for drinks than the food. Overall that is really the biggest bad thing I could say about the hotel...and the reason I marked ""Value"" down. You also get free use of non-motorised water equipment at the beach which is certainly handy.

For breakfast there's a few choices of restuarants I recommend the Acqua we had the best breakfasts there, even if you're in the Ocean Club with the private breakfast buffet in the Club Lounge, selection there is small compared to Acqua, lots of choice and great cooking.

While the hotel is a good 40mins from the centre of the city it still makes a good base if you're planning on going into the city for a tour. While there are other hotels nearby once you're in the grounds of the Shangri-la you wouldn't know it.

We really enjoyed our stay at Shangri-La Cebu and would certainly return if we go back to Cebu. Please check out attached pictures and you can also see some video of the hotel on my youtube account at MokongX3M under the ""Holiday 2009"" playlist.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Perfect for family vacation.. We booked two adjoining rooms because I had my 3 kids with me, ages 10, 6 and 10 months.. we even brought with us our nanny. The place had everything we needed.. beach, water sports activities, pool, indoor games for the kids, and a variety of restaurants. The hotel staff were pleasant and accommodating. They even helped us in traveling to and from the hotel and around Cebu island. Highly recommended to all who plans to go to Cebu with their family.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We stayed on the club level which is well worth the extra expense, even for just experiencing the private dinning level. Although here on business we enjoyed the beach and the beach restaurant, although we found food extremely pricey. To be honest i could not recommend this hotel for a vacation as Mactan Island is tatty and overated. However, considering the choices the hotel is comfortable. The Panoramic room we had was superb with L'Occitane amenities etc. We had a dinner at the nearby Abaca boutique hotel. The food was superb, however I am glad we did not stay here as it has no beach and although beautifully designed the entire property is wedged up against an eight or so story building which overwhelms the site.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I had high expectations. Its Shangri-la, a 5-star hotel.

We stayed there with my 7 and 5 year old children. I was quite irritated by the security staff, when we arrived, she asked me if I was a hotel guest, and again asked if all of us were hotel guests. There was not even a greeting. I find that quite rude. It ruined my vacation.

Another was the waiters bickering at each other. I would have understood these if the rate of the hotel is not expensive. This is an expensive hotel, you pay for everything. I felt I was not staying at a 5 star hotel. Maybe because we are local tourist that we are treated differently from the foreign tourists. I was disappointed.",Staff:Value for money
"The hotel is as expected from a Shangri-la , organised , well run , good facilities and v . large. We were disappointed with the panoramic view room allocated as part of the view was of a large hole where another building had once stood , but we were moved quickly and without fuss.
The hotel was full - BUT mainly with conference guests which meant easy access during day for pool and other amenities (not sure how good that would be in a peak holiday time) .
Spa as usual excellent , club floor very good and well run by Mr Terence , water sports centre very efficient and well run. Beaches clean and lots of towels at the pool sides.
We had prebooked various things direct by email with hotel and the response was always prompt and with all necessary detail we could wish for.
Food outlets - would recommend the Italian restaurant , Acqua, as the food and service there was some of the best we have ever had in any hotel , Gianluca the executive chef is a star ! Not too happy with the Cowrie Cove - food a bit of a disappointment and piped loud music from a beach party spoiled an otherwise romantic setting , Tea of Spring Asian restaurant was o.k.
Trips to golf courses nearby organised efficiently and with car / drivers ( recommend Alta Vista )
Hotel staff ALL say hello as you pass by and genuine in their willingness to help if you are lost or need assistance .
Why have I rated only very good ? Probably overall the price is on the high side and some of the immediate hotel surrounds are not so pretty ( such as the large hole which is visible from many windows ) and the disappontment of Cowrie Cove .
But saying that we would most likely go again - chosing a quiet time of year , would perhaps like to see the hotel do more to get visitors to see outside of the hotel to give back to the poorer neighbourhoods( we went off on our own to buy things in local shops ) as it is definitely a rarified atmosphere along with the other large hotels in the area .",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
Beautiful and amazing! We loved this resort. They went above and beyond to accomodate us. There were lots of fun things for the kids to do so mom & dad could have some time for themselves. They even had beach parties for the kids. The pools and the beach was beautiful. The staff was incredibly kind.,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"My family of 5 took a break from frigid Beijing at the Shangri-La Mactan in February. We were not disappointed.

I suppose there is no point going over what everyone expects from a Shangri-La: it's all there. The quality of the overall resort, rooms, food... And the staff is amazingly friendly, as is often the case in the Philippines. So I'll focus on what stood out and what did not...

First of all, activities for kids. This is a very strong point. There are endless things to do for the kids. There is of course the pool and beach, but also all the activities surrounding them (diving, kayaking, etc.). There are also two great playrooms and day activities for kids of all ages - our 3 and 6 year olds were busy all the time.

The spa also stands out. Though expensive (it is the Shangri-La...), everything about it is top-notch: the premises, the staff and the actual treatments. It is a special treat to go there.

On the down side, I would say that the pool and beach tend to be very crowded. If you don't get up at 7AM to plop your towel down on a recliner, you can forget about getting a spot for the rest of the day. This is not something I enjoy doing: I think it is quite rude to reserve your recliner two hours before you intend to use it, but unfortunately you are forced into doing just that or you are left out.

Also, the pools - including the kiddy one - has no spot in the shade. So, you have to smear your children with sun cream and repeat very often, because they will always be swimming in the sun...

Finally, a comment on the beach. Though it looks wonderful, the sand quality is very rough. So rough that I got friction burns on my knees from just kneeling down four or five times to take pictures of my kids! My children also got allergic reactions from it. Now, I suppose it all depends on your skin quality, but we were not very happy with that and ended up not going to the beach much. One should however say that the sand seems different close to the water (within 5 meters): much smoother. So, if your kids stay close to the sea to make sand castles, they should be OK.

All in all, a very enjoyable stay, despite the few items I mentioned. Would we go again? Maybe, maybe not. There are other great resorts in the Philippines and elsewhere in the region, and the fact that this Shangri-La was crowded and that the beach was not suitable for us would make us think twice.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Having stayed at this resort over a decade ago and indulging at Chi Spa in 2007 made me want to come back and share the Shangri-La Mactan experience with my partner. From the Shangri-La lounge at the airport to the shuttle to the resort and everything else afterwards, we experienced expert hospitality and professional service. It was quite difficult to leave the resort since the weather and the convenience of all the trappings of a perfect vacation is all within reach. Our de luxe sea view room on the 6th level gave us a great view of the sea, main pool and gardens. With a PhP1,000 daily credit on F&B, it was easy to order away in any of the outlets in the property. After check out, we took the free shuttle to Ayala Center Cebu. During our ride, we realized that we had lost an earring. So after contacting the front desk, they were able to find the earring and return it back once we returned. For a guaranteed resort style vacation, Shangri-La's Mactan Resort & Spa has matured beautifully to its advantage of knowing how to take care of its guests and visitors.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"A friend and I decided to do a short girls trip to Cebu, Philippines and we ended up staying at the Shangri-la based on the advice or friends who had previously travelled to Cebu. Overall, it was a very nice experience and I would recommend it to travelers who are willing to spend a little more for a more luxurious vacation experience.

Pros:
-Spa is fab. My friend and I booked a package the morning of our first full day. With a spa treatment you receive access to the adult only pool area which was nice. No kids running around and you can order wine/food to eat right on your lounge while sunning by the pool. Once we got ourselves to the treatment room they started off by giving us a foot scrub and letting us soak in an outdoor Jacuzzi tub with flower petals, fruit & cold drinks. We also ordered a bottle of Champy just to get our vacay started off on the right foot. The massages were great but I wouldn’t recommend getting a facial or any other technical treatments. Also I HIGHLY recommend setting up your appointment for the morning vs. the evening. The later in the day the more backed up they tend to get and the more frazzled/tired the staff becomes. We scheduled another treatment for around the evening and that experience was a mess!
-Ocean Club is a must. We booked ourselves in an Ocean Wing room with access to the Ocean Club. Having breakfast in a quieter less crazy area, having access to free cold drinks/beer/snacks all day & a place to hang out while we were waiting for our late night flight back home was definitely worth the extra cost. With the Ocean Club you also get access to the adult only pool area in the spa. My friend says the two favorite things of this vacation as the Spa & the Ocean Club!
-Staff is extremely friendly. They went out of their way to be helpful (taping up my poor quart size ziplock for liquids that burst & giving me takeout containers so I could make sandwiches for later during breakfast). I saw many other visitors acting poorly to the staff and taking out random frustrations on them but the staff took their tantrums like pros and never acted unprofessional.
-Beach is swimming friendly. I would get up every morning and take a lazy swim around the protected beach area. The water is clear and beautiful and warm enough to swim in without any issues in October. They offer day old bread to parents with kids so the kids can feed the fish. I was not a fan of this as they tended to swarm around whomever was feeding them, but I could see why the kids would love it.

Cons:
-General pool & eating areas are really crowded and noisy. I highly recommend splurging on the Ocean Club so you can have somewhere quiet and relaxing to hang out other than your room.
-Restaurants were disappointing. We were disappointed with all the restaurants in the resort. The dishes were not that tasty and seemed over-priced for the quality of what we received. And I’m not particularly price sensitive about vacation dining out.
-Spa in the afternoon or evening is a bad idea. We went a second time but this time scheduled it for the evening before our flight. The whole experience was a disaster. They were 40 mins late getting us for our massage, they put us in separate rooms when we had asked to be given our massages in the same room when we made our reservations, and the masseuses were tired by that point so the massages were sub-par.
-Nightlife seemed non-existent. We aren't big night life folks so that was fine with us, but if you like going out at night then it might be a bit boring for you.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I must admit that I was dreading our first visit to this hotel during the
""festive season"" fearing an overcrowded resort teeming with screaming children.

Instead we found a very service-oriented situation with an abundance of cheerful
staff that almost always anticipated our needs before we had the chance to ask.

The ocean wing club floor (headed by mgr terence perez and his amazingly
attentive staff) is absolutely worth the extra cost, which was easily offset by
choosing the value vacation rate which included so many extras including
complimentary buffet breakfast and dinner each day AND worth it for the
unlimited laundry service alone which minimizes your packing needs especially if
your visit is part of a longer trip as it was in our case.

Even though we were visiting during xmas season the whole resort is designed in
such a clever way that we never for a moment felt the resort to be over-crowded
or even remotely full for that matter!

It was quite pleasant to see well behaved happy children, enjoying the well
thought out activities and play areas, chaperoned by dedicated hotel staff.

Our primary reason to visit was to scuba dive each day with
Scotty's Dive Center. Mgr johann along with his extraordinary and plentiful
staff, runs one of the most relaxed, organized, and knowledgeable dive
operations to be found anywhere in the world (from my experience).

Yann, our dive master / instructor was fantastic above and below the sea and
helped raise our confidence during many hour-long dives over several days.

The dive sites were spectacular, close by, and felt like we were swimming in an
aquarium!

And for non divers, snorkeling just off the resort beach in the marine sanctuary
is great too!

Once again, despite the 100% occupancy we barely ran in to other guests at the
dive center or at the Chi Spa which is a must visit - check out the seemingly
private pool. The Chi Spa is easily accessible by golf cart if you're too lazy
to walk 5 mins)

Despite our initial trepidation, the para-sailing (a first for us!) was so much
fun and easy that it should be on the ""must do"" list for everyone visiting this
resort.
The only fault i found and my only suggestion is that the hotel upgrade the wired internet access to WIRELESS internet throughout in each guest room- or at the very least in ALL ocean club guest rooms not just the lounge

We have already planned a return visit! Many thanks to all...",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed just one night at the Shangri-la to get a break from some heavy work, and it was what one would expect of a Shangri-la - high-end hotel experience. One gets a bit tired always saying hello or good morning to the army of staff around the resort but one doesn't come to the resort to get away from people and rather overcared for than ignored.

We mostly wanted to get some snorkeling in without having to do any island-hopping since we did not have much time. The hotel has a protected reef which one can snorkel over straight from the beach - the coral is not that great compared to Moalboal or even compared to Olangapo Island across the strait - and while the reef is protected there is not much education of the guests on how to look after coral). However, there is a good variety of fish, some of them large size (often hard to see in the Philippines with the overfishing) and friendly (a fair amount of fish-feeding goes on from the guests). Enough to keep us happy for a day or two.",Staff:Food:Location
"We woke up the Friday of Thanksgiving and decided we HAD to leave town for the weekend -- so quick as a bunny, I called Cathay and found they had seats on an afternoon flight to Cebu. I called the Shangri-La, a hotel we have stayed in about 6 times since it opened in the early '90's to see if they had rooms and we were in luck. By 6:30, we were in our bathing suits and floating in a tranquil stretch of beautiful seawater with the stars overhead. A lovely dinner outside on the patio of the Italian restaurant followed and we all happily went back upstairs to our rooms, knowing it is the quick and the decisive that have the most fun!!

This is a hotel that is ideal for a family with small children and was one we took full advantage of when our 4 boys were little. There is a lovely baby pool situated right next to the exit of the waterslide and next to a grassy area with swings. Ideal when we had the competing demands of an 8 and 6 year old (sliders), a 4 year old and and 18 month old (baby poolers)-- by sitting back to back, we could keep an eye on them all and actually have a conversation. The beach is a lovely small spit of white white sand with tame fish who come for bread in the early morning. There has always been a nice kids' club, staffed by lovely kid friendly ladies. My boys never protested when we put them in their pajamas, ordered their meal to be delivered to the kids' club while we went off to a quiet. meal. The downside to the hotel was always the food and the fact it catered to large groups, but the upside was that it was less than a 3 hour flight from Hong Kong and a mere 15 minutes from the airport to the hotel. The restaurants have improved, we know the ropes and staked out shaded lounges on the beach by 8 am and the reef off the shore has been at least partially rejuvenated (wonderful snorkling) so those downsides have happily been rectified.

In recent years we had ""graduated"" to other locales with 4 teenaged boys. But I thought of this hotel again ""in extremis"" because it was close, easy and do-able for a weekend. So far it was a choice I will happily make again now that our tastes have gone from the merely convenient and clean to the finer points to vacationing in style. However, this is not a long stay vacation option with older kids -- we would go crazy if staying much longer as there is little if anything to do outside of the hotel.

The Shangri-La has a ""club"" arrangement to the hotel that has a seperate entrance and a lovely lounge. This made checking in a breeze -- we arrived and were whisked right up to our rooms to complete the formalities. We have, I think, one of the best rooms in the hotel -- a ""panorama"" club suite -- Room 7001 and the boys had the room next door 7003. The rooms are fine, but not top notch. The living room of the suite is oddly shaped and the furniture cheap and not all that comfortable. That goes for the mattress in the bedroom, which is way too hard. The bathroom has a nice big shower, a lovely sea view and L'Occitaine toiletries, but lacks a decent sized bath. The room smells badly of mildew. The boys room, however, did not. The suite has a double terrace that looks out to sea, which is lovely and the boys' connecting room also has a big terrace with comfortable chairs and a full seaview.

The service has been very very good in all areas of the hotel. It has been a lovely stay so far and well worth the price and the effort of getting here.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Had the Panaroma suite for 6 nights and lved every moment of it. I would say the standard of service there was amazing, if not made by a few special people who would run to and fro across the beach to attend to yor everyneeds, thegreat but overpriced (for the philippines) CHI spa. I recommend taking a boat out to island hop, other then that, the suite had a great ocean view and huge balcony. Great location to the airport too and the resort has excellent security. I broght my gf there but had at least 30 friends around the place for an event as well. Great place for friends to chill but an even better mplace for couples to re-discover love. =)",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"Typical Shangri La. Go the extra mile and stay in the new wing with the sea view, its worth it.

Tips on eating, use the specialist restaurants, choose your dishes and you will be surprised how reasonable the prices are as opposed to the full buffet every night, along with a couple of glasses of the house red, which is more than acceptable. Vist the Spa and get a massage, they may only be little but boy do those girls have strong hands!
The diving school is also first class, with some of the dives only a 10 min boat ride away and quite good. Yes it was a long way, but we had a great time, and once again, all the staff are just so.

In addition to a really nice beach, the hotel offers the ""adventure zoon"" and the ""E-zone"" where there are plenty of fun evening activities. If you do not want to stay at the hotel all days, you can rent a boat from the local sea sport center and go for island hopping. You can even bring a chef with you from the hotel and have your lunch at a remote island. And do not forget to try out the Chi spa. It is a real luxury experience. Go for a ""value stay"" at the hotel, so that breakfast and dinner is included. The dinner buffet is the best I have ever seen (luckily there is a fitness center at the hotel).

"Beach was rocky especially at low tide but lots of fish; food was so so at buffet; people give you various different information depending on who you happen to ask. They have a free yoga class in the spa which was in the schedule for Tuesdays but no one will tell you that you have to make reservations. I showed up one time and they didnt have it bec they said I didnt make a booking. Well, why is an every Tues 10am advertised free yoga then? We wanted to buy this tray which they quoted us for the last 2 days but come time to purchase, they said they are not selling the trays and havent been for a while. Huh? The old wing is smelly my allergies just was out of control. Was sneezing as soon as I got in the room. Very musty. They have a new wing (ocean view) which was much better but you have to pay more. Just don't check out in that wing. We bought one of the 3-day packages but didn't have time to print the reservation. The person checking us in went thru our package when we got there but depending on who you talk to during your stay, some of what's included in our package kept on disappearing in the system. Finally the last day, since it kept on happening, I confirmed with Faith our included aiport transportation. She said it's not included. After discussing for more than the time I want to spend on my last day arguing, she checked w/ another lobby attendant and finally realized that indeed it was included in our package. Low and behold, once we were ready to check in, the charge is again in our bill! We then spent 1/2 hour arguing this with the person at checkout and while Faith was on the other line. They just can't decide. Granted is not a huge amount but to add to a USD#2k bill on a 3-day stay was just not right when we already paid for it! I guess the system is screwed up there! Instead of giving us credit, they charged us even more since they said there was an error in the bill that our spa bill was less than what it should have been.

"I was first hesitant to book our long awaited holiday due to the price but I said why bother with the price if its worth it, and indeed I made the right decision. My 2 nights holiday in this awesome resort was so wonderful that I am planning to go back next month.
I booked thru their website for an Ocean Panorama room but upon check-in I was enticed by Mae, the amiable Front Desk lady, to upgrade to an Ocean Club room, and again it was the right decision. We were assisted to our room by a very nice Chinese lady named Maggie. I remember thru her my friends from Beijing.
Our room has a spectacular view of the Mactan Sea and the Ocean Wing pool, which is the most important thing for us, as my partner and I love a good view of the sea. We also had a veranda with chairs and table where we can enjoy more the view,
Getting an Ocean Club room has so many perks and privileges that my partner and I truly enjoyed - among which are the cocktail buffet from 5pm to 7pm, the complimentary use of water garden spa facilities at the Chi and the private checkout which makes you feel very important.
We also had complimentary fresh ripe big mangoes and housekeeping is done twice a day, with some cute little details like bookmarks, weather advisory that I appreciate most. Also the toiletries are of excellent kind, that of L'Occitane. Really nice...love also their fluffy bedroom slippers and mind you even rubber slippers are provided by the hotel.
About the people, from the housekeeping to the service staff in the restaurants - they are all very accommodating and always ready to assist, special mention to our chauffeur, Arnel. We rented a car to buy our pasalubongs and to visit the Cebu tourist spots. He is so courteous, he is always ready with his umbrella to make sure we are protected from the sun and very helpful and quick to carry our shopping bags. He is not only a chauffeur but a bodyguard assistant as well.
The food also in the restaurants ( we tried Buco Grill, Tides, Lobby Lounge and Acqua - too bad we did not get to Cowrie Cove coz I got tipsy already and raining in our last night) are good though not so spectacular. Surprisingly, the prices are reasonable considering its a 5-star hotel.
To top it all, the place itself is real amazing. We were like kids swimming with the school of fish that abounds in the beach, also acted again as kids when we tried the complimentary kayak. Just sitting down in those beach chairs looking at the Mactan sea is so relaxing, it will make you come back for more.

Their seafood was really really great and they had fresh catch of the day on display everyday...

We had a very impressive, luxurious and relaxing couple Spa treatment at Chi - very expensive but worth every penny!

We were charged the local residents' rate (me and my kids are local residents, my husband, though a local live and work out of the country) with the corresponding freebies like the free use of snorkels and non motorized water activities. I think it's all worth the money we spent. We decided to stay at Shangrila after a thorough search for reviews on the Internet for the best hotel because it is the only hotel where we found a Kid's Adventure Zone to keep our children busy. What is not included in the reviews that I have read in the past is that, this hotel does not only have the kids' playroom but has a place for adults who still have 'the kid in us'. It has its own Time Zone where our family played video games together. My husband and I compete against each other in the Shoot that Ball game while our kids, play another game together. Token is only P10 each, very affordable. They have billiards and X-box and table tennis and more. What I found really exciting is that every day, they have special games in the morning and in the afternoon that they offer for free! On Wednesday afternoon, I even had the entire Karaoke room all by myself, also for free on that particular day! They have a small coffee & pastry restaurant near the Time Zone area so if you get hungry after a play, like my kids, we don't have to walk far to the restaurants.

Most of the staff are very professional, warm and polite except for a few, who like most local residents who work in luxurious places like this, would tend to look down on us & make us feel like they were saying "" are you sure you can afford this place?"" Anyway, there are some who are really very warm and exceptional, like Harold and Honey at the Chinese restaurant beside the Tides. I went there for lunch alone because my family had lunch earlier at the Tides and they were so accommodating and warm and sincere. I ordered only a cheap meal, with no drinks but they were so different that they did not make me feel like they were looking down on me. I only had my card with me and asked if I could charge my tiop against my credit card and they said, "" pls. do not bother, ma'm, but could you kindly just fill in our survey form if you have time?"" I did.

The only thing I do not like in Shangrila is this, I am a local resident and I know very well when my countrymen wants to ask money from us, not directly but in an implied manner. The staff who brought our bags from the lobby to the room received P200 from my husband as tip before he left us in the room. The next thing, when I called the housekeeping to request for a bath gel, there were three or four men who rang our bell and who were very very very kind to me handing me the bath gel. I have already received the gel in my hand and thanked them already but they stayed a bit more, all smiles, and evrything, you know, the kind that they are expecting for something. I wish all hotels would adapt the ""No tip policy"" like the PLantation Bay. This way, you will know, who really are sincee among the staff and so that there would be no favoritism and local residents like us would not be looked down upon, too. That way we would all receive the same kind of service.

Tides and Ocean view restaurant - staff were all kind and accommodating, except for some at Tides, whose attitude is like what I have mentioned, but generally, good enough. Whenever we eat at both restaurants, we order something for the kids which they do not have on their regular menu and they prepare it for us. The only thing I do not like with these restaurants, is that all their food is either, korean, korean-inspired or simply just like korean. Even their omellette. I wonder why can't they make their omellete taste like that in Shangrila Ortigas.

Room - the room is good, though not exceptional. It is also old. Ours was over Garden View but still nice because we can see the sea. The music in the bathroom is not working. There is only one key card that is functional. The non functional card instead of reporting that downstairs, we use for the lights alone. I love it that their wi-fi connection is free. From Shangrila, we wentto the city and checked in at Marco Polo Plaza, and OMG! they charge very high for the internet connection! P150/30 miutes if I am not mistaken. Good thing, I brought my Smart Bro.

Beach- clean, nice enough but nothing special. It is good though that they put lots of fish in front. My kid and I enjoyed feeding them with the free bread.

Pool - good enough but not very exciting especially the kid's pool, a bit boring even for the kids.

Overall, I would still recomend Shangrila Mactan to my friends and relatives and yes, I am coming back. Looking back, it's money well spent, considering the free karaoke and games, and Internet connection.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Stayed here with the family one weekend. Very relaxing, the pools and beach are great. The pools though are closed at around 9 pm. Plenty of tropical fish which swim with you and you can feed them with leftover bread are provided by the beach staff. Dry and wet sauna are free at the gym. Very satisfying breakfast at the Tides which comes free with the package. They even gave us free one night accommodation as bonus.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Came to this place a few times back around 1995/6? Recently just wanted to hit the beach and enjoy a little chill out time in the sun. So decided to come back

Pros
~Quick flight from Hong Kong so good for a quick weekend break
~Wifi everwhere (but my room!)
~Lots of facilities pools watersports etc
~Nice sweet staff
~Perfect weather still (april)
~Great snokeling close to shore !!
~ Cowrie cove-eating fresh seafood (excellent garlic pepper crab) this close to the water in a mellow environment still magical after all these years ( and unlike the other restaurants at the hotel that felt like zoos)

Cons
~ Small Beach can get quite crowded
~ I had to share my umbrella shade with a whole village from HK. This place definitely caters to the packaged tour folks, so bring your ipod if you want to block out the conversations.
~ As soon as I checked into my room I could hear kids and the TV blasting in the room next door, also my room (2026) was immediately below the connection bridge to teh main wing so I could hear the heavier footsteps
~ Cigarette butts on the beach
~ in addition to tons of guests on the small beach, beach also felt busy with a staff of at least 5 that spent the entire day scooping out seaweed from the water and sand
~ Mistakes in room bill

in sum: good for a weekend at most once a year, next trip to Cebu I'll try the smaller Abaca resort instead",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"My garden view room - my first thought when I entered it was, ""this is it?"" The room was only average. There is absolutely no view (we were unlucky to get a roof-blocking-garden room).

Staff - pretty friendly. We needed extra beds and they were very helpful to line them up for us.

Spa - there is no point to stay here without visiting the spa. It is the best thing about this hotel! The area was large and service was really good. If you can, book the couples hut - you get to bath under the stars.

Overall - the hotel location compared to the ""outside world"" is really crap. Don't expect to go off as you like because the hotel is off on its own. There are many things you can do within the hotel though, I especially enjoyed that it has its own beach and 2 pools. I would say this hotel is really for relaxation.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"My wife and I stayed here while visiting friends in Cebu. The resort is definitely more geared towards families. It was a large size resort with plenty of activities to keep kids busy but not much for couples. Because of the size of the resort, there were often long lines for breakfast and lunch. We ate at the Italian restaurant for lunch one day and it was pretty good. Our room happened to be on the ground floor in one of the wings where the ballrooms are located. As a result, it was incredibly noisy even late into the evening because there was a wedding going on and people were coming and going at all hours of the night passing by our room. Would definitely recommend getting a room on one of the upper floors instead. Overall, a nice short trip to Cebu. The city itself doesn't have too much to offer and there are certainly a ton of other places in Asia for a more private romantic getaway.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed here for 4 nights with our family of 5 (4 yo and 2 yo twins). Arrived with a direct flight from Hong Kong. Hotel shuttle bus was waiting for us and within 15 minutes we were at the hotel. We chose the cheapest room (garden superior in the main wing) and we had 2 connecting, closest to the new Ocean Wing. Please note that most ""garden views"" are actually ""parking lot views plus greenery. Because we were at the end there was no more parking lot and from the balcony we could actually see the ocean (and the Hilton). The rooms are fairly large with all the amenities and facilities you expect from a 5 star resort. Rooms weren't very very new, a little outdated but not in bad shape at all and very clean. Staff is everywhere and extremely friendly and helpful. One of the ladies carried our 15kg twin all the way to the room! Rooms have turn down service, plenty of towels, flip flops for the beach, etc. etc.

Pool area is also not brand new but in very good condition and well kept with good beds, cushions, large umbrellas and plenty of towels. Very nice large pool with kiddie area, water slide and also a small kiddie pool with sun protection (partly covered). there is also the Ocean Wing pool overlooking the ocean but it's deeper than the main pool so we didn't use it with the kids. Nice, cosy beach with again plenty of beds, towel service, water sport facilities, bar with drinks, etc.

Loved the breakfast buffet with large variety of food (Korean, Japanese, eggs, pancakes, pastries, fruits, breads, etc. etc.). Can sit indoor and outdoor. High chairs were never a problem. In the evening the kids also had their dinner here (free for them) at 6 pm while we sipped a cocktail, then we would put them to bed, the hotel baby sitter showed up at 7.30 pm (PHP300 per hour), and we would go out for dinner and come back 2 hours later. We had several babysitters, all in hotel uniform with badges and very sweet nice ladies (our kids were sleeping so very easy as well).

We had lunch at the pool bar twice (kids' menu available) and at the Italian restaurant Acqua where we would just share a pasta and a pizza (large!) with the kids. Prices are reasonable for a 5-star resort (e.g. Pizza Margeritha is PHP370, pasta around PHP400), kids' meal items around PHP400. In the evening we ate once at the Cove restaurant near the sea and enjoyed their seafood buffet with crabs, lobsters, squid, all from the grill. Really really nice, fresh and tasty (PHP1500 for an adult). We had dinner at Acqua one evening (a la carte) and also at the Buffet restaurant Tides (around PHP1700 per person) with a large selection of Korean BBQ, Thai food, ready made fried rice / noodles, but also sushi, sashimi, great desert, chocolate fondue, ice cream, salads, etc. Very very good quality, excellent presentation.

Overall, occupancy rates were about 50-70% when we were there so fairly quiet but still plenty of people and kids around. The kids also spent time at the Adventure Zone (socks and long sleeve t-shirts necessary) for PHP300 for 2 hours. There is also a toddler zone which is free (under 3 or 4 yo), but it's small so really for the little ones. The Adventure Zone is drop off for children over 4 yo, younger ones need to be accompanied. They also have half day programs (PH650) and full day programs. Free internet is available at the E-Zone (also computer games, etc.).

When traveling with small children bring your own diapers and swim diapers (2 for PHP550!! in the lobby store). We also brought crackers, raisins and some cookies for snack. Free bottled water is provided in the rooms daily (water from the tap is not drinkable).

One day we took the hotel shuttle to a shopping mall (SM City) for PHP100 per person (kids free). Nothing special but quite a nice, new mall with plenty of lunch options and stores like Timberland, Bodyshop, etc. (midrange, not the high end). Around the hotel is quite a bit of poverty with tight security at the gate (sniffing dogs, mirrors to check under cars, etc.), but the first night we had dinner outside the hotel just across the street at a Spanish hotel (lower priced than the hotel but still more expensive than the rest of the Philippines, but you can't blame them with the location, quality was pretty much OK, we shared a paella). There are also 2 more stores that sell beach / swim items and some snacks. Upstairs is an Italian restaurants. Also quite a few Korean restaurants closeby but they didn't look very inviting.

Overall, I would highly recommend it for a family vacation (and even for those without kids, but then possibly not during vacation periods and national holidays). Many of my friends here in HGK had already been. It's only 2 1/2 hours away, direct on CX. Staff, again, is extremely friendly, helpful and plentiful!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We got two adjoining rooms with a pass door so we could put the kids to sleep and stay up. The rooms were clean and quiet and each had a balcony. For Cebu this is DEFINATLY the best hotel for traveling with children as well as it has the best beach with snorkeling of all the hotels on Mactan island (Cebu). You can easily get a baby sitter / helper from the hotel to get away from the kids once in a while. We took a snorkeling trip to one of the small islands off Mactan and the wildlife is incredible!! Highly recommend this as the best destination in Cebu. We did not buy the inclusive trip but it may be a value, food and drinks ad up and you wouldn’t easily leave the premises to go for dinner etc.

"Whenever I go to beach holidays I stay@ Hiltons, but as this hotel got good reviews I chose this one and the other tripadvisors are not wrong. The hotel is lovely, staff are very helpful & polite, they greet you everytime they see you.
The rooms & beds are big & air cons are cold! There is everything in the room, kettle, chopsticks, dressing gowns, flip flops, cotton pads, hair dryers etc.
The breakfast is ok, I've has better but it's well catered for Japanese/Koreans/Chinese. The pool & beach is clean and have towels & ppl selling ice cream- what was disappointing was that there was no one giving out free fruit & lavender face towels on the beach like in Hilton Jumeriah in Dubai!
What was stressful was The Chi spa, we made the appointment at the reception area and getting there & everything was fine but at the spa, no one greeting us, we didn't know where the reception area was, they were trying to book us in even though we were booked in, but in the end was fine and the Thai massage was wonderful but no as good as Thailand! Another stressful experience was foot massage by the infinity pool- they double booked us and then we had to make 3/4 phone calls to get it sorted & they wouldn't let us cancel even though they messed up! Despite that the stay was lovely & they forgot to charge us for late check out! :P",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Just came back from Cebu shangrila. The hotel resort is exceptional, but it is very pricy for the philipines. The staff attitudes were great, service always with a smile.
I only have 3 gripes with the hotel.
1- when I checked into the hotel I asked for a Ocean wing premier garden room. However when I checked in they put me in a room with a view of a construction site and the parking lot on the 2nd floor. I complained and asked them to change my room. The first response I got from the front desk is that they would need to charge me an extra 2100 pesos to move to a panorama room. This was unacceptable as the room they gave me was not even close to what was described. So they told me to wait and go have lunch while they found me another room. After 2 hours they moved me into the main wing seaview room which they quoted was an upgrade. They did not charge me extra for it so I was fine with that. (note to other travellers do not book the Ocean wing premier garden room as all of the rooms are looking at the construction site.)
2- I extended another day so when I checked the bill they charged me an extra 4000 pesos for the last night which was not acceptable because when I extended they told me it would be the same rate. after a small wait and a check with their manager they reverted my bill.
3- Everything in the hotel is very expensive by Philippines standard.
With that said I did have a very nice and relaxing trip, the food is good, the buffet breakfast has a very nice large spread. The 2 swimming pools are large and clean. and the coral reef beach is upkept well. The chi spa is very nice and if you are bringing your girlfriend or wife it is a must try.
This hotel would have gotten a full rating if it wasn't so expensive.",Value for money:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"the hotel was nice; better than the other hotels i've seen in Cebu. Its a little bit farther away from the middle of the city, but it has a nicer private span of beach and near the airport.

the ocean wing was a bit smelly due to renovations - lots of new paint. highly recommended.",Location
"After spending a few nights in Davao, I had 3 nights waiting for me at the Shang Cebu. My first time though, with some trepidation, I booked in advance and had chosen to stay in their Premier Seaview Room (newly renovated tower). If I go back I would not hesitate to book the same room again. The other suites look spectacular but in reality I would only spend time by the pool, by the beach or out and about. I doubt really if the beach front view suites are really good value, as I would imagine you could feel a bit removed from the experience.

The room was spacious and the balcony views overlooking the sea and the garden pool were very tranquil and relaxing. Eating breakfast on the balcony was one of the experiences to savour! As was the food in general. I opted to do this on the 2nd day, reason being, I didn't like their buffet brekkie. It was overly crowded with tourists and the food was so run of the mill, I must say. Not even close to some of the Shang properties I've stayed.

I find it really hard to criticise the hotel at all. And whilst it may have been my first time on the island, hvaing walked around, I really did not see anything that came close in comparison.
The sprawling lowrise layout caters to the need of every holiday maker. Young, old, families, singles - yet the hotel is very peaceful and seemingly very private and unspoilt. Sensory overload!

Aside from the peaceful luxury of the facilities and the beach, the staff were overly courteous and accomodating... it was another fab Shangri-la experience.

If you are thinking of visiting Cebui, do not look any further than this hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"We were a bit disappointed when we first got to the hotel, since the architecture, garden and the pools are fairly plain, less of a bit flavor that you normally expect from the resorts in Asia. But overall, we did have a good stay in this hotel because of the great services as mentioned by other reviews too.

This hotel has a private white sand beach, the low tide timing change from day to day, but when it is low tide, you can go as far as about 50 meters away from the shore and still only about 1 meter deep. Quite a lot of fish and if the low tide hour is in the morning, the water is very clear, almost no need to spend extra money to do any island hopping. The marine life is quite good too. The hotel offer beach diving, but the price is a bit high comparing with average.

Another good thing about this hotel is the facilities in the adventure zone, different from the Shangri-La in Malaysia, this hotel charge their kids' club, but they have a big room with slides and playroom that my daughter loved a lot. She rated this kids' club the best among several resorts that we've been to.

The Chi Spa was quite nice. Although the treatment menu is very limited, but the facility is the best, the treatment is performed in individual villas with its own garden, changing room, and shower room. The Spa architecture and decoration are very interesting and tasteful.

Food wise, we liked the Italian restaurant next to the pool. The breakfast buffet is a bit boring and not much difference from day to day and the Chinese restaurant is a bit off... Some of the dishes appeared to be different from what we expected.

The 6-hole golf course within the resort can a good practice and we almost feel it is slightly better than Cebu Country Club in Cebu city. (That Club has some real problem, the water around the course was stink and caddie doesn't do much but ask for tips.) If you plan to practice only, no need to bring your own clubs, since the green fee also cover the rental of club and balls.

Lastly, we noticed that this resort has a lot of big group visitors for conferencing, presentation, company travel, etc.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"My husband and I stayed at this hotel in early August. This was our first stay at the Shargri-la. We have stayed at Plantation Bay on 2 previous visits. We loved Shangri-la. We will be staying at this hotel on all future visits.

We stayed in the Panoramic Suite. It was a beautiful suite. The only problem was that the toliet broke on our last night. The hotel offered to move us to a new suite. Since it was almost 10pm (and we had to leave for the airport at 4am) we decided to stay in the suite. The hotel arranged for us to use the suite next to ours for any bathroom needs that night.

There is a variey of restaurants and all have very good food. The spa was excellent. We have stayed at many luxury resorts throughout the world and this resorts rates near the top of our favorites list.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

Excellent food and service was A+ and all employees were highly responsive to anything needed.

I have stayed at Allegre Beach Resort and Plantation Bay, and it's kind of a combination of the two. Would definitely stay again and recommend to others.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"The buffet breakfast was excellent the diversion of foods made my mind blow, the fruits were very fresh & everything was topped up almost immediately even before it begun to run out, the freshly baked breads & rolls made my morning but the downside was the mass of people pushing & shoving like it was some highschool cafeteria, there was really nowhere to sit so waiting was highly likely...other than that it was a great stay.",Food
"We have stayed at the Shangrila many times over the years, and it remains an excellent well-maintained resort with good service and average quality food.

We specifically love the fact that they have a play center for kids which is far from boring, it is spacious :)

"I have never stayed at a Shangri-La, and judging from the reputation of the hotel group, I had expected a wonderful stay.. But I was wrong.....

First the reception took a long time to find my reservations, and when they did, they got my first and last names mixed up and did a jigsaw puzzle on them. When I tried to correct the reception staff, I was told that it was the system's fault.

I was then given a room right at the end of the block. When I entered, I realised that it was a twin singles, instead of the king size bedroom that I've reserved.

Next was the carpet. It felt really sticky to the feet.. Totally uncomfortable.. Its as if it is still drying from a major spill..

Then the TV, a 21-25 inch low definition, bulky colour tube TV I often see when staying in motels...

Then the Do Not Disturb sign look tattered and worn, and kept flying off the handle..

Worse still the room beside me was undergoing construction work.

But the worst thing of all is that I've got a toilet with broken flush (I realised that after I've finished my business), insufficient toiletries, e.g. on Day 1, no hand towels, no face towels, insufficient soaps..

The experience of the room was so bad that I almost wanted to check out instantly!

"We recently stayed at this property for 2 nights under a Philippine Airlines Package Tour for 2. I must say that the service was outstanding from the moment we arrived at Cebu International Airport. At the airport upon disembarking from the Plane someone from the hotel was there to greet you. We were then quickly transported by air-condition motor coach to the resort which was very close to the airport, about 10 minutes. At the hotel we were quickly checked in and was even upgraded to an executive room. The room was large, the beds comfortable, the bathroom shower quite large. The only complaint I have with the bathroom was the tub faucet did not work, but the shower handle in the tub did, a minor inconvenience. The room had a large balcony overlooking the ocean. The grounds were well kept and maintained and the hotel pool large. While the hotel did charge for internet in the room, quite expensive actually at php300 per hour and php 800 for twenty four hours, they did have free wi-fi at the lobby area. The best thing about the hotel was the service. Everywhere people were smiling and greeting you and ready to help in anyway. We had the buffet breakfast at tides restaurant for several days and the selection was wonderful. We also tried the tea of spring chinese restaurant. The service was fantastic but the food I felt was just average. All in all this hotel is great, with everything you need and want in the hotel grounds. The only negative as I can see it is that it is quite a ways off from the main city areas.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"This was the best hotel/resort I have ever been to till this point of my life. I swear I will be def. coming back to Shangri-La CEBU again!!!

The best service:
shuttle bus- only 15 min-ride from the cebu airport to the resort, staff have a list to pick us up even you didn't request for the service anyways. only in a minimum charge of $150php per head

Staff- they are SUPERB friendly and helpful and everything. Everyone is with the brightest smile to serve you. You can feel what the best service is. My bf and I are so amazed at these smiles. One night we took a cab from the City back to resort, it was quite a torture to get a cab successfully in the city as you have to bargain price with the taxi driver(they often charge you at least 40%++) and the traffic organization at SM MALL in the Cebu city was a mess. After 45-min ride we finally got back to the resort and the main gate staff's warmest greeting and smile gave us the best support. Just you can see they are really cheerful and professional! I tip them very happily too! haha!

Accommendation- We actually arrived earlier than the check-in time(2oop,m,) since our flight arrived at 3sth am. We planned to have a early breakfast at the hotel restaurant as we have no place to rest. But Shangri-La offered a room for us without paying extra fee as they are fully booked with the same type of rooms. So we can rest in this room and change into the original room we booked. GREAT!!!!! UNEXPECTED!!!

EXTRAS- I e-mailed the hotel to ask whether I would have welcome fruits or drinks as we were staying to celebrate our 1-year dating anniversary. As we check our own room, a bracket of fresh fruits was already there. the sweetest mangoes and bananas and apples and oranges!

We actually check out before we left cebu as we were staying in bohol for 2 days. The hotel did the best as they have this luggage storage service so that we can leave them there and just bring our hand-carry to bohol instead of taking all our bulky luggages to this island. FYI bohol is a pretty place worth going to. They have the smallest monkey in the world and you have to go and see those spectacular chocolate mountain. We had stayed in the beach resort called ""lost horizon"". Nice stay also.

The hotel offers us a catering/beverage coupon for us to use in any restaurant too! so we can save up like $500sth php.

All areas of the property (from food and beverage to the spa) are outstanding. A special note that the Chi spa is one of the most unique spa experiences that I have ever had. Each massage client gets his/her own bungalow for the treatment. It is a truly remarkable setting.

We stayed 5 nights that the property and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

The property has a regularly scheduled shuttle bus to SM Center as well as Ayala Mall. It is easier to take the shuttle bus (100 Pesos one way and less hassle with taxis that tend to want to rip people off) to Ayala Mall and then take a taxi to other points in the city.",Location:Value for money
"We stayed in this hotel over the New Year. It is a nice hotel with lots of activities for children. Great for families, however, it is quite pricey. To launder our clothes cost $400 - kind of took us by surprise, especially, when we found out we could launder our own clothes at the in house laundromat.
The gym was well kept, the grounds are well kept. Hotel is very clean and kept up. We even attended the ""Barrio Fiesta"" on Tuesday night. They served typical Filipino food, which was delicious, not sure about the authenticity of the dances/dancers, however, I was glad we chose to attend the show.
Overall though, the $ were well spent. Our children had a great time. We loved the breakfast buffet, everything imaginable on the menu. We also loved the beach access and kayaking for the kids. The pool was adequate and I was grateful for the covered kiddie pool for our little one. (great protection from the intense sun, that even sunscreen could penetrate)

"Most definitely one of the best resorts I have ever been to! Wife and I made a last minute decision to book at the Shang and we have not regretted it one bit. Yes, this is an expensive hotel. Let me tell you, you definitely get what you pay for. The breakfast buffet (included in our rate) was awesome. Freshly made omelettes, make your own soups (I stayed away from this as I couldn't figure it out!! haha), every kind of breakfast you could ever imagine (Japanese, Western, other Asian-themed...tons of fruits!). If you eat it for breakfast, it'll almost definitely be there.

Otherwise, plenty of chairs and umbrellas all around the resort. Then again, it seemed like the resort had a surprising low occupancy rate for a December weekend. PLENTY to do, to include at least 3 pools, beach, water activities..table tennis, badminton, 6-hole pitch n putt course...it had it all. For us, we were just looking for relaxation and we got it! Yes, all the food these is relatively expensive. You can go out on the town with a free hotel shuttle. We didn't have nearly enough time.

First of all, the service is amazing, people are always trying to please you more. That was really a surprise for us.

The fish restaurant is good but expensive but the surroundings are worth it.
The hotel gardens are simply beautiful and perfectly maintained.
The beach is very nice too and the water was clear. We took a small boat to go snorkeling around a nearby island (nature reserve) and it was amazingly beautiful (lots of corals and colourful fishes). Everything was perfectly organized by the hotel staff and the atmosphere very relaxed.
Our children loved the E-Zone and had much fun in the pool too.
The room was spacious, modern and very clean.

"Shangri-la resort cebu is one of a few resorts in Cebu I do loved, I don't even mind spending so much money to stay in any resorts as long as they treat there guest with respect, cater to there needs and most importantly back up there reputation by giving the guest the best possible attention.

I have stayed in this resort twice 2006 and 2007, the first time I had stayed there I was mesmerised by there service and specially the resort. It was similar to our Shangrila in Cairns and Sydney Australia, but with better service. So I decided to take my 2 kids and partner as well as our 3 Australian friends to Cebu for my 30th b-day. But from the moment we checked in till we checked out we had nothing nice to say about this place. They had managed to ruin there reputation from our point of view. Everything we ask or tried to get any hiccups done was not taken care of in the outmost proffesional way!

These were the problems;
Check in was crap, our visa debit card was rejected due to them not accepting it as apparently they only take actual credit card with no debit link onto it..

Our 20,000 peso deposit was not enough to hold 1 standard room, and 3 ocean clubrooms. So I gave them 100,000 peso cash.

Family and friends was insulted by staff member saying that I had to pay for whatever they had consumed in ocean clubroom as they were not staying customers. At this stage children were allowed.

Due to staff messed up, we didn't celebrate my 30th like we had planned!

The rest of my family and friends checked out, and was very appalled by the service and the mis handling of everything.

Day manager of ocean club rudely told me to quickly check out so room cleaner can proceed from cleaning the room for next paying customer. Mind you we were staying for another night.

So we moved from room 8002 to 8019, it was good view but not as great as the other room.

My 2 children was not allowed with my partner to join him in the ocean lounge for the cocktail hour, while they never told us about it the day we check in, apparently management changed ruling that day. We did not avail half of our complimentary stuff, we lost interest.

That's when I made my formal complain through the general manager, nothing came out of the complains. But the Shangri-la room director did spoke to me on the phone and said "" I am very sorry for all the inconvenience that occured during your stay and the matter should have been handled properly, the next time you stay with us I will make sure you will be looked after"" Fat chance lady, the least she could have done is see me in person instead of talking to me via phone! Where is the proffesionalism in that?!

For me the matter was not resolved properly and it was a very disatisfying outcome specially from a 5 star resort!

The part I found it funny was the family I had there was 2 lawyers, 1 engineer, 1achitect, 1 counsellor and 1 travel agent. I was not sorounded by un educated people and they had be little us in so many ways. We did file a formal complain but like I said nothing was done about it...

I did warn them, that without your international customers they wouldn't be standing and also a word by mouth goes along way rather than a advertisement itself.

Further more, the 1 month we stayed in cebu these hotels and resort are worth the money and the star rating they hold.!

Plantation bay penthouse is 1 of there best room. This is the best 1 of them all for us.
Marriott executive rooms are the best. good service at pool bar
Waterfront deluxe is good too very nice.
White sands is also good (not so nice food)
Bantayan Island marlins resort good views (standard room)
Bohol divers resort beautiful (but crap showers!)

As for shangri-la we payed 75,000 peso, and everything about it was not worth it! If you want proper service and money's worth head for plantation bay! look for Marchie Cuizon....",Staff:Value for money
"My family of four stayed at the hotel from oct. 31 to nov. 3,2007. It was easy to book through the hotel website and the kids adventure package was reasonable, considering that the price includes the room, buffet breakfast for 2 adults and 2 kids (aged 4 and 5), unlimited full day access to the adventure zone and even free lunch for the two kids at the adventure zone! Check-in was a breeze and we were given a room that was spacious with a view that was exceptional. the beach was clean and my kids had so much fun at the swimming pools! there ware slides,water games, nets for volleyball and a basketball hoop. the service was wonderful and whenever we meet a hotel employee, they were all smiles and very polite. The breakfast buffet was sumptious and plenty. though there was always a long line at the entrance during breakfast, the turn-over was fast! My kids loved the adventure zone and was never bored. i love our room, the hotel, the food and would have tried the chi spa but didnt have enough time. would surely recommend this hotel resort to friends and family. my kids are already asking when we're going back! =)",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"Excellent resort! My wife and I stayed at the Shangri-la for 3 nights and we rented 4 rooms for her family to stay with us two nights. It was expensive but worth the cost. The free buffet breakfast is the best. It is a great place for kids as we had a bunch with us. The staff is very friendly. Everyone seemed to know it was my birthday. There are definitely cheaper places to stay but you get what you paid for. We had a fantastic time even with the main pool being down for maintenance.

I'm looking forward to seeing what the Shangri-la looks like at Boracay when it opens in a couple years. I would definitely go back to this resort again.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri-La Mactan is a nice resort if you want to splurge and treat yourself and your family. The Chi Spa is probably a bit overrated; althought no doubt they have been trained, many of the therapists appear to be new and inexperienced. There is also way too much ""ceremony"" (i.e., foot washing and use of scents), which results in less emphases on the actual massage session.

There are worthwhile outdoor activities available; restaurants to try; entertainment at the lounge to enjoy; a modern gym with sauna; a well-manicured landscape and maintained facilities; several gift shops; an outdoor game room; and a reliable and solid staff.

One benefit of Shangri-La is that it is not too far from Cebu City, so if you're raring to spend a day or two out of the city, Shangri-La is conveniently located only a relatively short distance away.

Overall, a worthwhile get-away close to Cebu City.

"An absolutely amazing resort with so much activity and things to do.

The grounds are remarkebly well manicured and the beach pristine. The resort was busy but there was always a chair and umbrella to shelter from the sun.

The staff are sensational too and the recognition second to none. Variety of restaurants is special too - be sure to take time out for a 5pm cleansing ale at the beach bar.

Do remember to book time for Chi the spa. One word - indulge",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"For the money we paid to stay in this resort, we expected world class amenities and service and we got them. We upgraded our two suites to the resort's presidential suite for a few hundred dollars more and don't regret it. The suite was over 2000 sq. ft., we availed of the free unlimited laundry (we had 5 days worth of dirty laundry), and we also received complimentary breakfast and dinner. The suite had sweeping views of the resort grounds and the beach.

The facilities and the grounds have all been covered by previous reviewers so there's no point in describing them.

What really pleased us most was the hotel staff's honesty and willingness to go the extra mile to help their guests. My husband forgot his wallet in the suite and realized that it was missing when we were forty minutes to boarding our flight out of Mactan Island to Manila. I called up the front desk in the Ocean Wing of the resort and, without hesitation, asked the front desk personnel to drop what she was doing and help us with our predicament. My husband had about $7000 in his wallet. That's about two years' salary for a housekeeper in the Philippines. After a few anxious minutes, the hotel let us know that they have retrieved the wallet and that they were sending the shuttle to the airport to give us the wallet. Every single dollar and credit card was accounted for! Because of airport security, we didn't get to thank the driver properly and we didn't get the chance to get the employees' names because the gate was about to close. We intend to do something about it, though, and writing this review is just one of them.

Our sincerest thanks to these honest and caring resort employees!",Staff:Value for money
"My family had recently stayed at the Shangri-La Mactan and booked 4 rooms under the Ocean Club package. It gave us an all-day access at the lounge which was great and the staff there was top-notch. My only complaint here was that the website listed ""check-out as late as 6pm"" as an Ocean Club benefit. When I checked in, I was told this was subject to availability. Note to hotel: You might want to put a note on that benefit so as not to mislead people.

The grounds were sprawling. The staff were generally nice. The rooms were like any other Shangri-La - clean and quite nice really. I loved the Adventure Zone for kids and the staff there couldn't have been nicer. As for our room, I had problems with the flusher and the heater took a long time to kick in. My biggest problem was that being in the Ocean Wing, we had the ""privilege"" of being under the Ocean Club lounge which meant we would hear foosteps as early as 6am from upstairs. My sister stayed in the next room and apparently they heard footsteps until late at night.

The beach was something else. It's a marine sanctuary so you could see fish all over the place and even feed them. However, the sand was quite rocky and the water was not that clean. The sand bothered me a lot and turned me off from going to the beach. It's like someone just crushed pebbles, spread them around and pretended they're sand. They were quite painful.

When I checked out, the staff inquired about my stay and I told him of my complaints. The reception manager called me only to say (in so many words) that it was my problem because I never complained the whole time during my stay. (I take care of 2 kids and have no time to complain. In fact, I wouldn't have if I had not been asked during check-out). She eventually toned down her attitude when I made sure she knew that I did not appreciate her attitude. Prior to my stay, I was also given some bad attitude by a reservation officer when I had phoned in to inquire about my reservations. Note to Shangri-La: your hotel staff couldn't have been more wonderful but some of your reservation and reception officers need lessons in dealing with guests. This is after all a service industry and I would have expected more courtesy.

One final note on Cowrie Cove. It's highway robbery! We went to Phuket earlier in the year and for half the price, you can get real mega-sized lobsters rather than crayfish! Acqua was quite reasonable but don't bother with the pizza.",Staff:Food
"Overall, our vacation to Cebu, Philippines was a wonderful one. Shangri-la was great, it appears like their customer-centric organizational culture is consistent across the board (we stayed at 3 Shangri-la hotels in the Philippines). We had our 2.5 year old son in tow so the choice of hotel was extremely important to us -- must be kid-friendly, clean, and safe. Food was great (at the hotel and even those local ""eating establishments""), grounds were well-maintained, comfortable & clean rooms, and equally as important, Shangri-la has a very friendly staff (Cebu, Makati and Ortigas locations).

When we were in Cebu, we practically lounged by the beach and pool for 2-3 days. We've noticed that the staff did not discriminate with their services -- regardless of what nationality the guests were, they gave them the exact same high quality of service. There were a couple of older gentlemen who work there (whose names escape me at this point) and they were extremely nice. They played with my son, checked up on us every half hour or so to check if we needed anything, etc. One worked by the rental shack and the other, taught us how to sail.

I have very fond memories of Cebu mainly because I spent it with my boys (husband and son) -- but fortunately, our stay at Shangri-la was problem-free that our vacation was stress-free.

Surely, we will be back.",Staff:Food
"Stayed here April 14-16, 2007. Check-in was a breeze, they got us in our rooms quite fast and fixed the extra bed (which is actually just the sofa bed) right away. We paid approximately $40 for the extra person per night which turned out to be a steal considering it includes the buffet breakfast which is about $25 per person if you were to pay for it separately. We got a king-sized bed which was so comfy, the bathroom was roomy, and the balcony was a perfect place to hang out if you wanted a quick escape to your very cold hotel room after simmering in the scorching hot summer weather. We got a bayview room which also includes a view of the parking lot and lots of trees and barely, just barely, a vew of... the bay! (It doesn't deserve to be called a bayview room) Ask for the garden view room instead, it's in the newer wing and it's closer to the pool and the beach. Checked out Chi Spa and quickly decided that it really is too expensive for us locals especially when we get spectacular massages in the city for just a tiny fraction of Chi's unbelievable prices. We lounged around at the beach with my 2 year old daughter keeping herself busy playing with the white sand. The sand just isn't as fine as I though it would be, there are a lot of sharp objects like shells and small corals so wearing flip flops at the beach will protect your feet better. We decided to have dinner at Cowrie Cove which turned out to be a big mistake. Selection was limited, servngs too small yet too pricey, and it took forever to come out. You would think that everything would taste great after we were almost starving by the time the food was served but it was just okay. Well maybe more than ok but really not worth what we paid for it.

Breakfast is served in 2 venues and we chose Acqua since we heard there were less people having breakfast there. There were a lot of choices but one can really just eat so much. Although finding out about the price of the buffet, it really isn't worth $25. We took some bread with us to feed the fish which is probably one of the most exciting parts of our stay. You can go to the beach and feed the fishes! Hold on to the bread and you can feel them getting bites from it. It's awesome! There are a lot of activities to choose from, very pricey ofcourse so be prepared to spend, spend, spend. We were content to lounge around the numerous lounge chairs scattered around the beach and just stare out into the clear blue water. After a quick lunch at Tides which was once again just ok we decided to head back to the beach and try some snorkeling. It was low tide by the time we got back but head out to deeper water and you will be rewarded with the sight of corals and fishes. After our disappointing experiences with the food outlets we decided to head into the city to have dinner instead. It's quite a drive heading into the city but there are better choices of restaurants there.

Overall we enjoyed our stay and wish that we could stay longer. Life really IS a beach!",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"First of all we love sating at the Shang compare to other hotels, we have stayed at island shang HK, Taipei, Singapore , Edsa, Makati and Cebu. So far all places were well maintain clean and has a courteous staff, With Island Shang, being the best of them all.

My review starts with the plus points of Mactan Shang,

We were here three years ago and the place has improved a lot, the restaurants were all newly renovated. ok Fine
The ground are clean and well maintained as ever, so taking a stroll in the early mornings and evenings will be delightful.
The pool is not really over crowded even at 100% occupancy this holy week
The beach was even better with far less people, We never really had a problem since me and my kids are early risers.
The room was clean when we arrived,
The service was not bad since we are golden circle member, no need for long lines during check in.\

The minus points,
The food in all outlet are really poor especially after seeing the bill. The buffet was more expensive the Edsa or Makati Shang,
The quality was even worse,
Paying 1500 ++ is ok as long as you get quality food that you usually get from other Shang hotel, Ex will be Paparazzi at edsa where you get Sea Bass, lamp , prime rib etc, At Mactan You get roast chicken, and roast pig for the same price.
The Chinese restaurants was the same ,serving was too small that a 5 yr child can consume an order of chicken that was supposed to be for two.
The cowrie grill was the worst, The seafood buffet was the worst, The crab were small and hollow with little meat, the beef was hard as a rock, the fish were not fresh and overcooked, the sashimi was sliced so thing that it looked like it was a cross bet sashimi and carpaccio, cost cutting maybe?, The coconut crab was overdone and also not fresh, At what pissed a lot of people was, it took the a along time to refill the trays,
The only good food service outlet was acqua, food was good and quality was ok.

Whenever we see the chinese and head chef walking around, We tell ourselves these are the reason we are not really enjoying ourselves, When we go on a vacation we view food as an integral
part of our experience, sad to say they disappointed us on the aspect. Which the place had a more convenient location. That's also a problem place was so secluded you need to use the hotel to get anywhere.

Any My kids love the place , just hope they will improve the food service outlets,",Food:Location:Value for money
"Lets get this straight, if you are on a budget don't bother checking out Shangri-la Mactan. For a 2 nights stay (for a local resident) I spent almost 600 dollars. Of course I got moved to the Ocean Wing, which is like the premier wing of the hotel, no its not anything like the Valley Wing. Staying at the Shangri-la requires you that you come in style...never take coach, chances are when you come in you would see those orange/white/blue tags on bags that says ""PRIORITY""...so your bags would be terribly out of place if you don't have it.

Next is the rooms, I heard the main wing still looks the same, my last trip to the hotel was about a year ago, so I'm not sure how extensive their renovation efforts were for the ASEAN summit last January, but the Ocean Wing rooms look good. Unfortunately I was not able to get any Ocean view since I was given a garden view but I'm not complaining. The beds were soft and comfy, I stayed at the Marriot in Cebu last month and their linens were already rough due to age and constant washing.

Aqua, is the hotel outlet at the ground floor of the Ocean Wing, which also serves breakfast, on the main wing you have their main outlet Tides. anyway since you have a view of the ocean with an infinity pool, having breakfast at Aqua is always a nice experience.

I had a very nice lunch at the hotel's Chinese outlet, Tea of Spring and was impressed by variety of teas they offer, I was able to try about 5 out of the 50 different varieties of tea they had during my stay.

Over all its an amazing stay and its something I'd do about once or twice a year...thats if I don't go broke. hahahaha.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"A quick summary if you don’t want to read the rest of this review:

On a 1-5 scale, with 5 being the best, I would rate this resort as follows:
Food – 5
Staff Friendliness – 5
Kid Friendly – 5
Adult Oriented – 2 (do have table 54 dining and Chi Spa for couples)
Pool Service – 1
Restaurant Service – 3 to 5 depending on meal time and restaurant
Room – 3
Overall value for money – 4
End rating – 4 Star, not 5 as is advertised

This resort is very, very kid-friendly! If you’re looking for a couples place with very few toddlers/children, this is probably not going to be the place for you. This resort has a long list of kid-friendly age appropriate activities. They even have a separate play area for 0-2 year olds (must be accompanied by adult). On this trip, we left our 22 month old daughter at home. If we had known how much this place caters to families, we would have brought her along. There were children everywhere. In fact, families are the norm here. In the restaurants, you’ll hear babies crying, kids being kids. Again, if you’re looking for a mostly adult guest resort, this is not the place to come – unless you pick an off peak or non-holiday time. If you have kids 12 and under, this is the place to be!

The clientele here is mixed, Japanese, Korean, Europeans and Australians. Guests are pretty well behaved other than the occasional noisy kids running up and down the hallway slamming doors.

Arrival
We arrived before check in and only waited an hour as the resort put a rush on cleaning our room. This gave us just enough time to book our Chi Spa massages, our reservation for Cowrie Cove’s Table 54 and to have a refreshing drink in the lobby bar.

Service
The service was quite impressive other than poolside. For example, while waiting for our room, when I returned to the line to see if the keys were ready, I was waiting behind a couple who were engaged in a slow moving transaction. After waiting about 5 minutes, a receptionist who was not working at the large check in counter came up behind me and asked if she could help me at a smaller concierge type desk area off to the side. She prepared our keys and away we went. At most resorts, we would have remained in line at the front desk until it was our turn for service.

Another example of their attention to service, I had arrived at the lobby bar with my laptop under my arm. Wireless service is available in the lobby. I was looking around for a place to plug in. One lobby waitress approached me and asked if I was looking for an outlet and directed me to a place where I could plug in. She had noticed me looking around, and was quick to meet my needs without me having to ask. Other little things like this occurred throughout our 5 day stay.

The workers do not pass without a friendly greeting and a warm smile. The food was excellent, whether it was a hamburger in the lobby bar (not on the menu but you can still order), a wonderful Italian dinner at Aqua (husband had the sea bass; I had the ‘make your own” penne pasta with white clam sauce. Mmmm, DELISH!!!! Or a pizza poolside. Then of course there’s the Table 54 experience at Cowrie Cove. This is a do not miss meal! 5 courses, starting out with cold seafood, a split lobster and large crab, mussels, shrimp, scallop and spicy calamari on a noodle bed. Next seared tuna, then chowder soup, surf and turf filet with jumbo prawn (by then I was so full) topped off with dessert platter of delicious treats. And a bottle of sparkling wine tops off this set menu. This one peaceful, romantic table set far apart from the restaurant is a meal we will never forget. And again, the wait service couldn’t have been better.

Needs Improvement
With that said, there are some things that were not in line with “5 Star Standard”. For example, the ladies restroom by the game room was out of soap. Two of the three dispensers were broken and the third was empty. One of the toilet paper dispensers was broken as well. I brought it to a worker’s attention, later that day it was still not refilled. The next day though, the one operational dispenser had been filled. As an “FYI”, the restrooms at the Ocean Club pool are much nicer.

Our room was not very impressive. It seemed a bit tired, the teak furniture on the balcony chipped and peeling, the bathing suit rack on the balcony wall rusty, the furniture in the room marginal. But how much time do you really spend in your room? Shower, change, sleep. The rest of the time you’re outside enjoying the wonderful weather.

Another thing in my mind that makes a resort 5 star is if you can satisfy your customers even during peak season when the resort is fully booked. We visited this resort on Lunar Holiday – of course a busy time of year. The first night we could not get a reservation at a restaurant, that’s why we had a burger in the lobby bar which was not that big of a deal. The lobby bar has comfortable seating and a great view and was not over crowded. The next day we called around noon to book dinner reservations at Acqua, the Italian Restaurant, but it was already full. We contacted the manager and in the end, they were able to accommodate our extra table for 2. The buffet breakfasts were jammed packed, only one 4-slice toaster for so many people. Three people waiting just for the toaster. Doesn’t take much to add a second toaster. And the egg station, if you wanted eggs, you had to wait in line to place a custom order. Usually buffets will also have a scrambled egg selection that is already in the buffet line. Little things like that which can keep people from waiting. Understanding the need to accommodate a large holiday crowd, the resort had opened a 2nd restaurant, Acqua, to handle the breakfast crowd. But some things could have been set up a bit better to keep people moving through the food service.

Pool Service was way below average. In many resorts, you’ll see wait staff constantly walking the pools taking food/beverage orders. Sometimes they’ll even offer free chilled water or cold wash cloth towels. Here you had to go get a waiter to place a drink or food order. This was the case every day we were there, and the same for both pools. The 3rd day we were there, the resort ran out of diet pop. For a Shangri-la, this is totally unacceptable. Pool service definitely needs improvement! Also “FYI”, no swim up bar in either pool.

And of course this resort is no different than any of the others we’ve visited. Better get up early to reserve your poolside chairs. I went down to the pool at 7:00 am to select a good location with much required umbrella covering.

Chi Spa
Wow, what can we say about a 4.5 hour massage? Wonderful, relaxing, top notch and very professional. The private villas were comfortable, and the couples shower and outside bath area very discreet and private. If you can afford the luxury, it’s worth doing at least once in your lifetime!

Would we go back?
If we had children, definitely! If no kids, it would depend. First, if this was the only trip available, then yes, would still come anyway. But if I was traveling without kids and I had other places to choose from, I would not make this my first choice. Unless it was non holiday or non peak season where families would be less inclined to visit.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I am Louie Salva of Manila, Philippines. We are on our Cebu-Boracay tour composed of the students of Bachelor of science in aircraft maintenance technology and bachelor of science in tourism. And we are more than 60 staying at that hotel. We stayed there from the afternoon of January 20, 2007 until noon of the next day. Between that we have some activities that takes our freedom from enjoying the hotel. I think that this is an awesome hotel. I love its scenery. I love its fresh air. I love its fresh look. I love the hotel staff. It's a big hotel that makes it peaceful especially in off-peak seasons because there's a big possibility that other guests will be away from you. In fact, the rooms of our class are isolated from each other, and I like that. I love the lay-out of the hotel. Inside there a lot of trees and plants that is surrounded by the beautiful hotel building. That shape of the hotel is not the usual shape of a hotel like that of a square hotel or a simple shaped hotel. Its shape is distinct from the others.
The room is great.
The rooms are clean and complete with facilities that are convenent. I love the volume control and the speaker inside the lavatory that lets you hear the operating television while inside the lavatory.
There are great facilities like the big childrens indoor playground, daycare center, pool tables, two swimming pools, and many more which unfortunately, we havent tried because of our lack of time. We should have stayed there a lot longer.
The food is so great. It's so fresh. There are a lot of choices of food from different countries. I didnt even bother to get rice because if you combine those foods, a plate is not enough. Being a Filipino, still, I didnt eat rice.
Unfortunately, We only stayed there for one day because we need to go to Boracay according to our etinerary, and we really didnt have enough time to take advantage of the facilities and the amenities of the hotel like the beautiful swimming pool and the beach.

Thanks to Andrew and the rest of cleaning staff for doing a excellent job. The Chi Spa is their pride and joy and I would recommend every guest to try it.They have cultural shows during the week that presents native Filipino dances whilst enjoying a buffett of Filipino delicacies.At the lobby they have entertainment every night.And if the guests were feeling ill, they have their own 24 hour clinic and will deliver the prescription to the guest room. If you fancy going out of the resort for some serious shoping the shuttle bus(free) will take you to SM then Ayala Mall by the hour. They also have their in-house car service through Avis for safety and convenience. However if you fancy a transport thats cheap & meter you can always use Spider Taxis (2591579)which will collect you at the gate.We had a fantastic time at this resort and will definitely recommend it to our friends and families.The tight security at the resort entrance made us feel more secure as guests in this resort.The next time we come back to this resort we will have to stay for 3 weeks at least.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I am in the hotel industry and work for Radisson SAS. When I travel abroad I am vert fussy about the quality of hotels I stay in and I can assure you that I was not dissapointed on choosing the Shangri La Mactan Resort!

Rooms: Very modern and up to date. Lovely unit at bathroom sink. Everything in proper working order. Cheap mini bar compared to European 5 star hotel prices! Fresh feel to room.

Breakfast: Out of this world. Absolutely huge selection and all fresh. Never appearts to be lying there for too long like in amny hotels. Food for all nationalities from Chinese. Korean, Japanese to European and American. There was about 200 items to chooses from and restaurant was lovely and chic.

Pools: Had 2 pools but we stayed at ocean wing pool for all of our stay as it was closest to our room. It was gorgeous infinity pool looking right over to the ocean. Hotel had 500 rooms but there were days we seemed to be the only ones by the pool. It was excellent. Tony the pool guy was brilliant to us.

Beach: When I go om my holidays I prefer to stay somewhere where there is a great beach. I did read reviews about beach being rocky. There was lovely sand at beack and water nice and warm but it was rocky. However pool was so nice that we never really need to touch the beach. Went jet skiing one day and it was really good fun.

Facilities: Amazing Rang of facilities: chi spa, deadly tennis court, indoor and outdoor pool tables, 6 hole pitch and putt course, internet cafe, games room, 5 restaurants, lovely lobby bar, water sports, kids club, shops, laundry room s well as beautiful walks around the grounds. The resort was in no way tacky. It was extremely well laid out.

Acqua Restaurant: Italian restaurant in which we ate 4 out of 5 nights stay. Staff very friendly especially Novie and Maricell. Delicious pizza, tomato soup, seabass and tiramasu.

Outside of hotel was very poor area but you never noticed this until you step out front gate of hotel where they have piles of security like every hotel in the philippines.

I would go back to this hotel again and again if I had the money! Look out for Gerry at Ocean Wing Reception. He was an absolute sweetheart and also Sylvie who makes the waffles and pancakes at breakfast!

Thanks Shangri La for a wonderful holiday!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I stayed in the Ocean Wing of the Shangri-La which had it's own entrance, lobby and check-in counter, separate from the main building -- very convenient. The room was spacious with a garden view, 2 twin beds and the all standard amenities. The only thing I didn't like was the TV -- reception was inconsistent with some channels very fuzzy in black and white with no sound. I didn't spend much time in my room so I didn't bother to call the hotel to have it fixed or check if it was the same in all the rooms. For people who need to watch CNN/BBC or keep abreast with news from home, this could be a problem.
One of the things I loved about the resort were its sprawling grounds and lush gardens. There's lots of space for kids to run around and many winding pathways perfect for an after-meal stroll or morning jog. For those who like the indoors, there's a day care and activity center for kids (with a huge jungle gym). The Entertainment Zone has foosball, pool tables, air hockey, computer games, karaoke and movies on DVD, etc. -- all of which can come in handy when you tire of the beach or during bad weather.
For sun worshippers, there are 2 swimming pools and a private beach, which isn't very big, but has its own restaurant, volleyball court, and the requisite umbrellas and lounge chairs. The sand is white, but not fine powder like that of Boracay. It has it's own coral reef which is great for people learning how to snorkel. While walking back to the shore after snorkeling, I cut my toe on a sharp rock, so I advise wearing booties just to be safe.
I sampled many of the resort's outlets -- Tides, Acqua, Cowrie Cove & Tea of Spring and sad to say, I was quite underwhelmed. No, the food wasn't bad, it just wasn't exceptional. For the prices that they charge and the way they market themselves, it is natural to expect a lot from the Shangri-La. On the other hand, I found the service quite exceptional. People were always friendly and approachable, going out of their way to see to my needs -- when I injured myself at the beach, the attendant was there with a first aid kit right away; the driver who took me to the airport made an unscheduled stop so that I could buy some delicacies to take home because he didn't want me to pay the high prices at the airport shop.
The pride of Shangri-La Mactan is their Chi Spa which is almost like its own little village within the resort grounds. I had the ""Indulgence of Time"" treatment which involved a footbath/footscrub, Himalayan bath, steam, shower, massage and facial (phew!). These treatments are done in the comfort of a private villa at a relaxed pace (almost 3 hours) which really lends itself to an overall feeling of wellness and pampering. For people who don't have regular massages, a treatment at Chi Spa would be absolutely heavenly (albeit expensive). But to be totally honest, the massage (per se) was just as good as the best massage I've had (the setting kind of makes you expect more), however the whole process of treatments, combined with the beautiful surroundings made for a truly memorable experience.
In a nutshell -- in terms of service, facilities and overall ambiance, this is one of the best resorts I've stayed in. I would've given it perfect marks if not for the issues I mentioned above.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"We had our wedding reception here in January following a ceremony at a private beach. Overall it was a great experience. The wedding food was amazing. The hotel had an onsite event planner, Tiffany, who has since transferred. She was great - very responsive to our needs, professional, and a pleasure to work with. Our guests (many travelled from the US) were quite happy with their stay. Plus, we had a really good group rate.

For the brides to be: We had actually hired our own local wedding planner who we found independently of Shangri-la, which in the end proved to be a mistake (won't get into details, but involved a crucial element of our wedding - the license!). Probably would be OK using Shangri-la's staff alone, as I know they perform numerous weddings there year round for guests from all over the world (we are from Los Angeles). We had the reception in the garden next to the pool. What looks like just an empty patch of grass down the hill from the pool actually turned out quite beautiful. They did a great job with the physical structures needed for the reception setup (lights, tables, sound)

The hotel grounds are beautiful. Cowry Cove is great for dinner and drinks, the Tides breakfast buffet delightful, the staff very friendly - from the front desk, to the room staff, gym, salon. ""No problem"" was the response to many of our requests. The gym is great, with equipment as good as or better than at my local gym in LA. Chi spa is beautiful, though the quality of the services not out of this world, pretty much average.

The only major drawbacks were
1) a bathroom leak in our room during the last 2 or 3 nights of our stay. We weren't offered any sort of discount or compensation for agreeing to keep the room (don't remember if switching rooms was an option, but no one went out of the way to help us out besides calling the plumber. He fixed it the same day, but our carpet was left damp and smelling like mildew).
2) transportation. we have relatives in the area - don't know what we would have done without. Evening is tricky: If you are trying to get back to the hotel from the city, taxis are reluctant to take you back to the hotel since it is difficult for them to pick up passengers at night there, so essentially it is a wasted trip for the taxi. but some will do it for a surcharge, etc. However, the hotel has much to offer you probably won't need to go out at night anyway if you are just there to relax.

Overall, we had a great experience and look forward to going back!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"Got back last week for a short three-day vacation at the Shang. It is still worth it. They've just completed renovations early this year and I've noticed a lot of improvements. If you have kids, the play area is huge! For teens, there’s E-zone, which has Internet. Xbox, billiards, and karaoke facilities and a small coffee shop. I was disappointed that the business center was open from 8am-8pm only, but was glad that they have Internet access in this area up to 12mn.

This is our third or fourth time since 2001, and this time we stayed at a superior garden view, Unless you are really picky on your view, this room isn’t that bad. Our view was of the immediate outside gardens and of the Hilton. I tried to recall if there was any difference from the time we stayed at an ocean club room - well, its just that then we can view if the pool was crowded (which never happens during our stay) and just to peek at the sea. But other than the view, you can do well with rooms of lower category. We paid less than $400++ for three nights stay on triple sharing with breakfast. We requested for a room with two beds, plus and extra bed. Surprisingly, it wasn’t too crowded.

We were surprised that occupancy was high last week. According to the staff, about 80% of the guests these days are Koreans, and a few Japanese. Not to worry, after breakfast, which becomes too crowded at times, these tourists go on island hopping and city tours. So we basically had the pool and beach to ourselves on both days.

The sight of a lobby full of Japanese and Korean tourists upon our arrival didn’t translate to poor service as we were escorted to the room in less than 20 minutes, and surprisingly at around 10am which was 4 hours than the regular check in time. On our second day we requested for a late check out for our third day as our flight was late in the afternoon and we were given up to 2pm. I don't know if this was courtesy extended to Golden Circle members, but if it is, well go ahead and sign up on line like I did (go to --- for the link to golden circle club).

Since we’ve done the Shang-Cebu thing before, we’ve actually managed how the taxis work. We’ve already contacted our old driver from our trip before and arranged for our trips to the city as we wanted to go to the city on our own time. Also arranged for a Southern Heritage tour, contacting the tour agency from Manila, lessening the hassles during our trip.

My only regret was not being able to check out the Chi spa, as, honestly, the prices were a turn off. But Chi aside, I'd always go back to the Shang. Unlike some reviews I’ve read about the resort, well we were treated very well and the staff were very welcoming, specially the water sports/recreation staff by the beach and the restaurant staff at Buko Bar which is the lovely restaurant right at the beach area. Its been always one of my favorite places in the resort.

I’m glad that we did not experience anything bad this time. I remember one vacation in 2004 was ruined by the island hopping/parasailing desk personnel who was so rude, lacked courtesy, and drove me to write a loooong complaint to the hotel then.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"All I can say from my stay at the Shangri-La in Mactan is over rated and a ""cookie-cutter"" average high rise hotel. I just got back froma 2 week stay in Cebu. I booked the Shangri-La for 7 days because of all the ""hype"", and thought it was the best... I was highly mistaken. First of all, when you enter the property, you are surrounded by roughly 8 people with automatic weapons, shotguns and sidearms, a metal road block, people with mirrors looking under the cars, and dogs. I felt like I was entering a military compound, not a hotel. Then, I check-in and go to my room. It is a small room with no ""out of the ordinary"" features. A simple room at a penthouse price. They advertised 2 pools. One was closed, and the main pool was a average size pool with a lifeguard constantly blowing a whistle to stop people in the pool from doing whatever. If the people in the poolside bar / restaurant aren't too busy chatting with one another, you'll eventually get a menu. Don't rush to Paradise Island.. It is not an island. Just a rock on a sand beach. Last I heard, a island was surrounded by water. If you need to use the internet, be sure and bring money. If the pain of the hotel rate wasn't enough, they charge 300 pesos an hour to use the computer. The grounds remind me of a below-average hotel in Hawaii. The hotel workers smiles and greeting are about as phoney as a 3 dollar bill. As soon as they say their greeting, you can watch as they pass and go back to the blank face they had before they approached you. Let's chat about the restaurants.... There is the $24 USD breakfast buffet one can enjoy.. Be sure to show up early. The buffet offically ends at 10:30AM. We showed up at 9:45AM, and all of a sudden the stocking of the buffet started to end. At 10:10AM, we were told the buffet was going to close. So much for the 10:30AM closing time. Last I heard, the buffet should close at 10:30AM, and people finish when they are done after. Be sure and keep your eye on the buffet line, as the other guests (from other Asian countries) are very loud, have little manners, and will gladly cut in front of you, and in one case... I ordered a special ordered omlette, and just when the chef was to put it on my plate, one of the ""other guests"" pushed his plate only to take my omlette. Yes, that happened. So, I waited for another. The Chinese reataurant across from the buffet is so unorganized. We went in to eat, and was told the reataurant was full. 30% of the restaurant was full. I showed up 5 minutes later, and was seated by someone else, still with empty tables. The food was average. There is a seafood restaurant by the beach that was fairly good, but overpriced and the fish in the tanks were on their last breath. Even before they were plucked from the tanks. They also have a buffet, but be prepared to fight for your food (like the breakfast buffet). One nice thing I liked was the Chill Out bar. Very hip bar overlooking the ocean with nice drinks and fair prices. Want some live music at the Lobby Bar? Be prepared for a guy with computer generated music and a woman singing Karoke without the TV screen and lyrics. Sad and a bit laughable. We spent 3 minutes there. It felt like we were trapped there with the same pool, the same guests to fight for food with, and the restaurant selection was poor. They do have a shuttle that goes to Cebu for shopping, but with the military guarding the main enterance, it makes one wonder what they are infact protecting us from...!??? We choose to take a taxi. But not to worry if the shuttle is a little late. I had the honor of watching the Shangri-La shuttle in front of us coming back from shopping passing on a 2 lane road, causing people and tricycles to have to run or drive into ditches to avoid being hit head-on by the screaming shuttle trying to make its schedule. Glad I was in a taxi. Now, for the good... The Air Conditioners in the room work very well.. The coffee in the $24 USD breakfast buffet is good. The Chill Our bar was nice. Anyway, I changed my 7 day trip to the minimum 3 day package trip (told them I had to fly home early), just to get out of there. I didn't even have another reservation, but that was fine. If you are older, maybe a bit boring, or enjoy below average cookie cutter hotels at peak rates, this may be ideal for you. If you are even slightly adventurous and want to stretch your money far further, try the Plantation Bay. Far superior. I wish I stayed there first. I will now in the future, and will never recommend the Shanbgri-La in Cebu. After the terrible experience at the Shangri-La, I hired a taxi to look at every resort on Mactan. After 2 hours, I ran across the Plantation Bay. The Plantation Bay is far superior in every way possible, and finished my vacation there. I was sad to leave. I spent over $1100 USD for 3 miserable days at the Shangri-La... Lastly, once again.. If you like overpriced below-average hotels with poor food selection, loud pools, islands that are in fact not islands, small average rooms, live music featuring compuper music and a Karoke singer, buying an extremely simply female bathing suit for $90 (that would cost $10 or less in Sears or Walmart), and the most phoney greetings you have ever had the pleasure to laugh at in any hotel (see for yourself, you will agree), this may be for you. If not, take a look at my Plantation Bay review. Everyonce and a while you will see tall skinny Europeans with clipboards who look like managment of some type like they are monitoring all of the employees. I assume the greetings are being evaluated. Yes, thet are that fake. I have been to over 30 countries, and this is my first negative review of any resort. Do your sue diligance before booking here, There are so many other nice resorts to explore in Mactab and in Cebu. I recommend passing on the Shangri-La....",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
Stayed at the Shangrila Cebu last march 22- 26..S0 SO Shangrila-- didnt really lived up to its Shangrila Standard..the ocean view was ok nothing spectacular..theres always a long line at check in.. buffet breakfast is not recommended at all..most of the restaurants of the hotel are fully booked since the locals dine there too..and they dont have priorities for hotel guests at all..i would suggest the Plantation Bay than this mediocre Shangrila ..,Food
"I live about ten minutes away from Shangri la Cebu. I have been to many top resorts around the world from Europe, Asia and North America and I would have to say that it is par with what most 5* resorts around the world has to offer. After all, it is a Shangri la resort. The newly opened Tides restaurant serving International dishes is pretty good. Shang Palace serve one of the best Chinese food anywhere in Cebu. The newly refurbished Cowrie Cove has amazing views over the beach. A lot of their facilities are either brand new or newly refurbished inlcluding the rooms and spa.
If you are looking for a 5* resort with everything that comes with it (ie., 400+ rooms, lots of guests/tourists, restaurants) then you cannot go wrong wth Shangri-la Mactan, however if you are more into seclusion and privacy then Plantaion Bay Resort, Alegre or Pulchra will be more your idea of paradise.
Finally, the service in Shangri-la Mactan is exceptional!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"I’ve stayed at this hotel now a number of times. The hotel is beautiful, centrally located in BGC with very clean rooms and great restaurants (Samba is a must!). There is free access to Kerry Sports, which I love.

Each time I stay though, I feel as though it’s run like a 3 star hotel where the front desk staff are so painful about providing room upgrades (none for Jade members) or honoring seniors discounts. Check-out is always painfully slow. This type of mentality is what keeps luxury tourism in Manila from progressing - clueless staff who have no idea of proper customer service. I want to be clear though that other staff in the hotel including the team at the Horizon Club, housekeeping, bell boys and waiters were all wonderful and helpful.",Staff:Value for money
"We stayed here for my daughter's 9th birthday and I was very impressed with how they prepared for our stay. The weekend also coincided with our wedding anniversary. Their attention to detail to ensure we had a comfortable and enjoyable stay was very much appreciated. There were welcome packs for all my kids, including outfits for Adventure Zone and other giveaways. Cakes for my hubby and I and for my daughter. Daily supply of bottle water (500ml for each of us). Sure, the price is most likely included in the room rate but I like that you don't feel short changed. Staff was very accommodating. My kids loved the tent set up and my youngest even insisted on sleeping inside the tent :) overall a memorable stay for us, would definitely come back. Bonus is we were able to do laundry every night with their built in washer and dryer :)",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I have been a very loyal Jade guest of the Shangri-la and this recent experience has been extremely poor, especially from the hotel management. The Chinese President Xi Jinping and his delegation stayed in this hotel, but as a guest we received no notice at all and when I checked out I was not informed that all the roads were blocked into the hotel. At a minimum, hotel guests should have been notified of the upcoming disruptions and on the day given advice on how to minimise impact...during a prior stay, we are notified if the pool is being clean I appreciate that the Shang is well known for hosting dignitaries, but the lack of information and the attitude that the management team displayed towards the non-Chinese guests were appalling. An experience not to be repeated. I WILL NOT STAY HERE AGAIN",Staff:Cleanliness
"Certainly one of the more appealing hotels in Metro Manila, yet a golden cage. Security at the Fort-Knox is abusive, invading, and obnoxious. Nothing is ever done to help assert the rights of (presumably) respectable GUESTS over the ways of the local wannabe security business. It is bearable for short stays. For longer stays, there are friendlier options by far in Manila - if less glamorous on the surface.",Staff:Location
"Stayed in 2–room apartment in their Residences with my family. The apartment was HUGE and very beautifully appointed. We were provided complimentary around 8 litre bottles or mineral water which were more than adequately accommodated by the full sized ref in the kitchen. The very spacious bathrooms were stocked with L’Occitane products and fluffy towels. Huge plus was the complimentary access to Kerry Sports and the Adventure Zone.

Other Pros: location is walking distance to BGC High street and malls. There’ a an M Bakery (Magnolia bakery of NY) across the building exit and Din Tai Fung just 7 minutes walk away. St.Lukes Hospital and S&R membership shopping are just a 5-minute drive away.

Cons: it is a high end place so expect prices from accommodation to in-house food options to also be high end. The breakfast buffet is an experience in itself though so I do encourage you to go for it. Otherwise, a lot of restaurants are within walking distance so all’s good.",Location:Food:Value for money

"There's a variety of restaurants just outside the hotel, a few walking distance also there's a marketplace nearby. Re: room rates, yes it maybe a bit pricey but it compensates with the variousand excellent amenities they offer. Adventure Zone for families staying with kids is so huge even adults can play too! P500 for 5 hours (1 adult/1 child) or P800 rate for unlimited entry for a day (1Adult/1child) too. Kerry sports center for the athletics and gym buffs.Open 24 hours I think, and there's a spa also but I haven't tried yet cause I have a kid in tow always. yay! Pools, they have jacuzzi and kiddie pool at the 8th floor. big kid-friendly, not too deep big pool also on the same floor.

A lot of reviews I read were complains re: exorbitant rate of their services and rooms. Rooms are spacious and beds are comfortable. Smart HDTV and fast internet are plus points. They forget to see and mention how warm and accomodating the people who work here. From the maintenance to the security, to their bell boys and cafe crews, it just feels like home every time. They will extend help without you even mentioning it. What stood out among them during our stay were the bubbly and jolly staff we encountered during our breakfast at High Street Cafe. Ms Jinnah and Ms Joy(who was very full of energy!) graciously gave my daughter a birthday cake and sang a song for her. I deeply appreciated your gesture.

If you love burgers try out raging bull burgers and for a great steak raging bull is the place to be!
For the gym freaks like me Kerry Sport is a super gym with all you need to stay, get into or improve you shape. While my wife enjoyed the yoga classes, I was having fun at the boxing master and the combat fit classes. Next to that the gym offers all the equipment you can wish for from cardio to heavy lifting they have it.
The room in the hotel was great with a lot of additional space to store our stuff.
For my wife’s birthday we had dinner with our family at Canton Road. Although the food was delicious the service needs to improve. The timing of the dishes was rather poor and didn’t improve only until I had a 2nd word with supervisor.

High Street Cafe - breakfast - host appears slow. Restaurant is noisy so I asked for a quiet table. Host asked how many rooms I had - I was confused by her question. Substandard service.

disappointment was when I forgot my bluetooth headset I was charging in my room when I checked out early in the morning. Unfortunately, I only remembered when I was already home in Iligan in the evening. I frantically called the hotel & I was referred only to the one in charge of lost & found who told me that there was nothing endorsed to them. They promised to follow up but it seemed they didn;t care maybe just because to them it wasn't such a big deal.

"If you’re ever going to indulge on a holiday hotel this is the place do it. It doesn’t skip on finer details and the hotel lives up to its reputation.

From the amazing decor to the patient and friendly staff this place is one not to miss. A great feature is the 3 story gym and the children play area (fees apply to children playroom unfortunately - this was free on our last stay). Breakfast is an experience in itself serving the freshest and tastiest cuisines and breakfast/brunch foods.

Thanks for the lovely stay. Hoping to come back!",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"cleanliness is excellent
booking and check in processes are efficient
hotel staff are very polite and warm
breakfast is very diverse
provided additional water and toiletries upon request.

downside:
One of our rooms was only available at past 4pm (almost 5pm) despite stating in our booking details that we will arrive at 1pm. We actually arrived at 2pm. My sister’s family had to wait 2 hours for their room to get ready. On top of that, we need to ask 4 times for them to unlock the connecting door to our room. I need to be mad on the 4th time before someone finally unlocked it. Lastly, we requested for an extension for one room since it was made available late, they only gave us 1hr versus their untimeliness of more than 2 hours. Why do your client be burdened by your inefficiency? Business is business but you need to be fair to your clients.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Rooms: excellent. Modern, spacious and very comfortable.
Common areas: outstanding. The gym is two floors!
Restaurants: excellent again. Samba is my favourite.
Location: very convenient if you are doing business in BGC. I am able to walk to my clients offices.
Staff: excellent, but to be fair, people in the Philippines have an innate warmth and hospitality, so I’m yet to visit a hotel in Manila where the service was not great.

Overall, I would say this hotel sets the standard for business hotels in a metro city. I cannot praise it enough.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"We had a wonderful 2 nights stay at this property. Staff were very warm, attentive and helpful. All our requests were attended to in a timely manner. I loved the personal touches like local delicacies as welcome gifts in the rooms, as well as our birthday cakes all ready in the room when we checked in. Thank you for noting the special occasions that I had mentioned when I reserved the rooms. The room is just lovely and huge and the bathroom has a separate tub and shower which I loved and enjoyed very much with the loccitane bath set. The hotel was very luxurious and location is superb! It has the best location in BGC for both business and pleasure. We also loved the amenities such as the huge and extensive gym, the pools, and the Adventure Zone for a fee. It was truly a very memorable stay thanks to Shangri-La at the Fort.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Simply amazingly good, that's all i can say. Rooms are luxuriously furnished and had everything you need. The staff, were always smiling and ever ready to help. This applies from front desk to housekeeping, cleaners, restaurant, every dept! Something shang is doing with their staff selection and training is right and very consistent across countries.

Now i just need to highlight about the gym. It's called Kerry Sports Academy and really humongous and well equipped. Spread over 2 floors and outdoor area. Machines and equipment I've never seen before, 2 squash courts, 2 tennis courts, 25m pool, and get this....a proper basketball court! It's open 24hrs and really makes you feel like working out. There is another 25m pool on 8th floor which is more appropriate for families and kids. This is simply the best.

There are 3 or 4 shangs in manila and this is the newest. If location is ok for you I'll highly recommend this one at Taguig!

So",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Location
"Stayed here for 5 nights as part of a work trip sponsored by my company. Security is good at the hotel where your car and bags are scanned before entering the premises. The check-in agent was super friendly and the process was smooth and efficient. Was assigned a room on the 32nd floor with an amazing view of the city. The room itself was huge, modern and clean although it does show its age a little. I got sick during the trip and they had an onsite doctor who visited me in my room to diagnose my problem and prescribe medication. Definitely a worth while service to provide to its guests.",Staff:Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities

"It was a very satisfying staycation with the family. We got the corner room (3303) and we were amazed by how it looked. It was spacious and complete with amenities. Our 4-yr old child immediately looked out the window and jumped on the bed to test the softness of the pillow and blanket. We knew we were in the right place when she said ""I love this room!""

The room is sleek, well-lit and clean! Most of the amenities are inside the drawers/cabinets which we loved btw as it looked so organized. During turndown, we were surprised to see our daughter's teddy at the center of the bed. This small detail made us feel ""at home"". Thank you!

We weren't able to try the gym and pool as we spent more time at the restaurants like Samba, Canton Road, High street cafe and Maisen (shops). Also, our experience at Adventure Zone was awesome! Our child was ecstatic! I also grabbed the chance to try all the obstacles and slides! We felt like a kid again.

Kudos to the staff especially the one waitress who was warm and served us well during our breakfast yesterday. Her name is Joy. Thank you! We noticed you smile and greeted all the guests in the cafe. What a lovely gesture, we felt very welcomed. Thank you Shangri La! We will definitely be back!

Ps. Hope you include bath bombs (like the ones in Lush) soon, esp for families who have kids. Bath times can be bondings too.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

"Transferring from a small business hotel to here made my visit more impressionable . I have been to other hotels and this one will be a favorite !
The entrance was clean .. spacious .. guards attentive .. front desk efficient but I had to wait til 2 for check in .. so I headed over to the cafe .. strolled around a bit .. .. then walked over to the entrance and asked if I could do ala carte instead of the buffet ... the staff was prompt ..
I got the berry margarita and a burger .. I enjoyed the margarita !
My room was quite spacious .. on the 19th floor..had a view of the rain and dark clouds .. the bed was king sized and was super comfortable .
I would visit again .
During the conference at Bonifacio A .. the food was tasty!
I would recommend this hotel and of course visit again .",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"Spent the weekend(july 13-15) in Shang ri La at the fort. The room is amazing, the staffs in high street lounge is very approachable and patient. Unfortunately, the room service food is quite cold even tho they use food warmer going up to our room. We did the in room dining 2-3 times, consistency on the temp is dissappointing.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The lobby, front desk service, and rooms are grand as usual. However, there is always something to be desired from their F&B service.

We arrived at the ballroom for a 5PM event and we were quite early. So, we decided to have some coffee at the High Street Lounge. Upon arriving at the host table at the entrance, the host was on the phone and hand signalled us to just take the nearest available table. The place was busy, but in a normal way. This table was behind their cashiering station. We waited for a few minutes and nobody gave us a menu. Beside us were two servers doing cashiering work and just chatting. We signalled the host to give us a menu. She did so. We chose our drink. Again, nobody was looking at us to take our order. So we tried hard to get a server's attention to order our drink. This is not bad service, per se, but you just expect more when you are at a Shangri-la and at one of Manila's grandest hotels at that.

Overall, the F&B service is not a huge issue and I would stay here again.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I stayed last week at Shangri-La at the Fort and all I can say is that it has been an extraordinary experience. The hotel is clean and beautiful and the rooms are spacious. The staff is excellent and service level is unmatched compared to the big names. I see the people of Philippines put their heart and soul in their job and this has resulted in the level of service you won't see anywhere else.

The staff at the reception had slightly mismanaged my checkout and upon realizing the staff's mistake, my room was upgraded complementary to a beautiful corner room with two-sided windows for amazing views.

I requested once that my breakfast be delivered in room at 4:30 am and guess what, I got a knock at the door at 4:29am by staff with breakfast. Food quality is superb. Thumbs up for the staff and management and special thanks to people of Philippines who made my first visit unforgettable. I will be back next week and I highly recommend Shangri-La at the Fort.",Staff:Food:Location
Beautiful Hotel like always Shangri-La never fails to be the best in any town! However I gave them one star less because there is one of the front desk staff named Spencer has absolutely no idea how to treat customers the Shangri-La way! So much attitude upon checking out and not helpful! So rude he shouldn’t be working in the reception! No respect at all! Shame!,Staff
"On our way to El Nido my Family and I decided to add a 4 nights stay at Manila BGC at the Shangri at the Fort. We took advantage of a nice 2 bed room suit that offered incredible value for money. It provided a luxuries and spacious environment both for my wife and I as well as for my two teenager kids. The service has been excellent both very fast and very friendly.

As reported by many people before the High Street Cafe breakfast buffet is amazing and the choices you have are literally endless. You can have your healthy perfect breakfast in line with your diet on one day and on the next morning easily indulge in some of the greatest sweets you can get in Manila - and later enjoy burning these calories at the Hotel Gym (Kerry Sports) or decide as I did to pick up the tennis record a bit inspired by Wimbledon and enjoy an hour of tennis.

My personal highlight however has been the High Street Lounge and the Friday evening Live entertainment. Between 21:00 and 23:45 my wife enjoyed three stints of 45 minutes of very talented and high quality singing and music entertainment. 21:00 - 21:45, 22:00 - 22:45 and 23:00 - 23:45. The ambient of the Lounge and the quality of the service is by itself almost ensuring a great evening experience - put the live music and singing on top and you have a very very memorable evening.
The mix of prepared program and openness to take almost any music request of the Lounge guests ensures great entertainment for everyone. And to be clear - the singer has been able to perform some of the more difficult songs ever written in excellence (such as Whitney Houston’s ""I will always love you"")",Value for money:Food:Location

"I've always been a loyal guest of Shangrila Fort since they opened 2 years ago.
I've stayed at many Five star hotels but No other 5 star hotels can beat the polite and warm service of Shangrila Fort.
I keep coming back here because of its superb service, cleanliness, very comfy, awesome ambiance and facilities. Until I also decided to be part of Kerry Sports Club. I've tried the Samba couple of times, Chef Carlo Huerta was very warm to his guests he always recommends me the best dish that fits on my healthy diet. :)
I love the menu of Samba. Amazing food and staff!

But I was very disappointed in High Street Lounge Service. The staff are very unattentive. slow service. No complimentary while waiting for the food. The waitresses are always talking and talking to each other without even attending the needs of their guests. I will never dine again in their High Street Lounge.

The guards are very caring and polite. Interior design is so inviting. I always enjoy my dining experience here. In addition to it, superb food, helpful, attentive, charming, congenial staffs, High Street Cafe, in particular. I developed warm friendships with the staffs. That is the most compelling reason why Im always here. Chris, Luigi, Chef Ryan Dadufalza , you deserved my Thumbs Up. I'm very impressed with the service and awesome food. One of the things I like about dining here is that they don't use MSG. That's something I really like when it comes to the food of Shangrila Fort. They have awesome menu specially if you're on a healthy diet. They have everything I want from quinoa to sugar free dessert! I love their Garden bowl salad and the Linguine Pesto. Hope you will not remove this from the menu. Had an amazing experience I highly recommend this hotel.",Staff:Food
"Dined here Sunday lunch in May 2018 for our anniversary since we saw some good reviews. Sad to say it was not worth the money.

There were limited choices of food (e.g., there were only about 3 Filipino dishes that time). Also, lobsters are no longer part of the buffet. Though I would have looked over those concerns, the food they served tasted so-so. Desserts were not that good too! (Super disappointed with that one since I love desserts and the lava cake they seemed to be proud of can't even be compared to the lava cakes of mall restaurants) The only redeeming dish for me was the maki. Service is good.

For the price of Php2,000++ (USD40++), this buffet does NOT live up to even half of that being offered at Manila Hotel (for around the same price). I was so disappointed that I didn't get my money's worth, and on a special occasion, at that.

Also, I've set the bar high since I already dined and ENJOYED at the restaurants of EDSA Shangri La (chinese and buffet) and I expected Shangri La The Fort to be the same level.

When staying here, I suggest you dine outside the hotel. There are a lot of great restaurants in the area which will cost you a lot less.",Food:Value for money
"I would like to say a huge thank you to the manager and the staff ( Timi’s team) who made our evening outstanding and did everything, plus more to ensure that we were comfortable and happy day spent at the restaurant. Special mention with their Shrimp w/ Salted egg, superb! The Best.

It really did exceed expectations. Thanks again!",Staff:Food
This last trip was our second stay at Shangri-La Fort. We used to stay at the one in Makati. The service at the Fort is far friendlier and very professional yet with a touch of coolness. We booked the hotel car to pick us up at the airport. The car was waiting and ready. The driver called ahead and we were greeted at the car by our former bellhop and now concierge Ethan. By booking the car we skipped the front desk and we were processed in our room. After check-in we wanted directions to Manam BGC. Ethan walked us all the way to the door of Manam. If you are looking for a great hotel with exceptional service look no further. Shangri-La Fort is your place to stay. If you need assistance ask for Ethan at the concierge.,Staff:Food
"This is the third Shangri-la hotel in Manila, and the best one yet. And in the whole Philippines, second only to Shangri-la Boracay. Checking in and out was speedy, and everyone, from the valets who take your car, the bellmen who take your bags, the front desk staff, and housekeeping, do their jobs happily and efficiently. The rooms and beddings are plush and comfortable. Sleep quality is excellent, Location of the hotel couldn't be any better; restaurants, shops, salons, and moviehouses are 2-3 minutes' walk away. Some minor cons, which can easily be fixed: 1) Lack of reading material in the rooms, such as magazines, hotel info, etc, 2) At the breakfast buffet, the coffee is weak and tepid, although when I pointed it out to a waitress, she offered to brew me a porperly strong Americano 3) The gym is open to paying local residents, and they tend to leave trash such as paper cups and tissues in the treadmills. Perhaps more trash cans should be provided, so that members can be educated to clean up after themselves.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed here for a week last month.

+ Really nice, modern hotel.
+ Great rooms with lots of complimentary water, toiletries. Always replenished each day.
+ Excellent buffet. Expensive but worth it. (just don't eat the previous day!)

- Pool was fine, but not so great for families (as the EDSA Shangri-La that I also visited)
- Location was good, but EDSA Shangri-La was better as right next to large SM Megamall.

Overall, if I visit Manila again, I would stay definitely stay here in the Shangri-La at the Fort again.

"Was in Manila for work and had the immense pleasure of staying at the new Shangri-La at the Fort. Without question it was the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. From the immaculate rooms, to the incredible food, every care is taken to ensure a brilliant visit. The staff at the hotel were the nicest and kindest people and I was humbled by their efforts to assist and make you feel welcome. From Joy our waitress at breakfast whose name matches her spirit to Dominic at concierge to the kind maintenance man (whose name escapes me) that went out of his way to find me a working laptop charger, the kindness I was shown will be the new standard by which I review other hotels. We stayed in club level rooms and the cocktail hour in the evenings watching the sun set over a glass of prosecco can’t be beat. The breakfast buffet was the largest I’ve ever seen and was delicious, there are also a ton of great restaurants on the premises to try. Shangri-La, you’ve spoilt me for life, thank you!",Food:Staff

Room: The room is new and beautiful, with bathroom amenities by L'Occitane. The view is awesome, which you can see the whole Manila.

Gym: The gym is huge, with a full size basketball court, tennis court, squash court and swimming pool, and with all kind of gym equipment. The best hotel gym I have ever seen.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"The Philippines have cornered the market on the best customer service and hospitality in the world. From the moment you are picked up at the airport by a luxury Shangri-La vehicle, you start to feel what the ultimate in customer service is. The ride from the airport to the hotel included cold bottled water, mints and fresh wet wash rags to wipe the air travel off. The rooms are fantastic with excellent showers and really comfortable beds and pillows. A nice couch for lounging and a desk to get work done. Hotel staff refreshes the room twice a day with fresh towels and water.
The gym is amazing. The largest in Asia I think with two floors and over 8,000 square feet. The mens locker room has a dry and wet sauna and two jacuzzies.
For a GREAT dinner, check out the Chops restaurant in the hotel. Absolutely the best steak I have had in years. Great wine selection and as always the staff is incredible (special shout out to Sunshine).
The breakfast buffet is also something I looked forward to every morning. The homemade waffles are SO light and airy. The only other place I have had anything even close to them was Belgium! Can't imagine staying anywhere else.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

I have stayed at several Shangri-La hotels in the Philippines before, so I knew what to expect. The rooms, lobby, restaurants, gym and pools were amazing.

"We've stayed at a number of Shangri-la properties but this was the first time we tried The Fort, and will definitely be coming back!
It is a beautiful property, within walking distance to both upscale and affordable dining and shopping options. Rooms are large and luxurious. Bathrooms have separate bathtub and showers, with L'Occitane branded amenities. But the best assets of this hotel are their people, who are very warm and accommodating. I have some examples, which may seem trivial but which we were very pleased about:

1/ We requested for vases for some flower arrangements we received during our stay, and they promptly provided. They were there when we got to our room.
2/ We asked for late checkout as we had lunch out on our last day and were not sure if we would be back on time. They accommodated us with a 3hour extension, in spite of the full day they were expecting.
3/ Their restaurant staff have the same accommodating attitude. We had dinner at their Canton Road Restaurant and wanted to order some dimsum items to add to our main courses. We were told they only serve dimsum in the daytime so we didn't insist. But the waiters/kitchen staff were able to whip up some dimsum items for us, anyway. And they were delicious!

Highly recommend it",Location:Staff:Food
"I was able to fulfill a dream of mine to stay at a Shangri-La hotel, particularly the new Shangri-La Fort in Bonifacio Global City (BGC), Taguig.

Needless to say, Shangri-La Fort is as luxurious as luxury hotels come. It has a great location -- right smack in the middle of commercial establishments, restaurants, and offices. Bonifacio High Street Mall is right across the front of the hotel, while Bonifacio Stopover (a commercial building with a number of restaurants) is located around 5-minutes away (on foot) from the hotel's back entrance. Uptown Mall, SM Aura, and Market Market are all 10-15 minutes away by car (without heavy traffic). The hotel itself also has a number of restaurants to dine in -- both their in-house restaurants and franchise establishments, and it also has shops. I highly recommend grabbing a buffet dinner at their High Street Cafe. It's pricey, but worth it. If you have a sweet tooth, you could try The Sugar Factory where they have yummy desserts. However, navigating to the hotel's driveway and parking can be a bit tricky if you are not familiar with the area. The basement parking area itself was also quite confusing.

The hotel lobby was great-- bright, wide, and airy with high ceilings. Crowding will not be much of a concern. There was also a beautiful chandelier, which my 3-year old nephew referred to as ""The Magic."" Hotel staff were very attentive and they made sure that I was not idle for a long time while waiting at reception.

We stayed in a Deluxe Room with 2 double beds. It was quite spacious, considering that there was a work table and chair, plus another chair with a foot rest. Our view was overlooking the side of BGC facing Makati. There were a lot of storage spaces for our bags and clothes. The bathroom was big -- it had a bath tub plus a separate shower area and a wide sink counter. You can also listen in to whatever is playing on the TV because there is a volume dial beside the bathroom door. Toiletries were provided, and water pressure -- both hot and cold -- was strong. They also provided an electric kettle, small refrigerator, cups, glasses, small plates, and an iron board. Robes and slippers were also available. I especially enjoyed the TV -- it was a Smart TV -- so we could watch shows from our laptop / phone via Youtube or Netflix by connecting / casting to the TV. You can also watch shows from your USB because it has a port. There are also a lot of cable channels to choose from.

We did not avail of the room + buffet breakfast package, but we did have buffet dinner at High Street Cafe. It was great! My favorite areas were the Japanese and the dessert areas.

As mentioned, the hotel staff was very attentive. On our last morning, I had an upset stomach. We called the Front Desk to ask if they have medicine they can provide. They went the extra mile and sent their Nurse to check-up on me before giving me medicine and oral rehydration salts. I really appreciated that.

The only thing that stopped this experience from being perfect was the fact that they put us in a room beside another room that was being renovated. We were okay with it the first day since we were out for most of the day, and they did stop working in the evening. However, on our 2nd day, we could hear the drilling and banging of tools. Again, we were patient because we were heading out anyway. Unfortunately, on our last morning, as early as 8am, they were already working. We were planning on sleeping in before check-out time but it was quite impossible because of the noise. We had to resort to calling the Front Desk to complain. In all fairness to them, they did stop immediately. I just hope that next time, the hotel does not put their guests in a room where construction is going on nearby. I'm sure they are aware about the construction activities. Shangri-La is not just any hotel, and there are people like me who will only get to experience staying there a few times because it's certainly not cheap. I expected my stay to be smooth and worry-free.

Other than that, we enjoyed our stay. I am willing to save up and get to stay there again. I just hope our next visit will not entail putting up with construction works anymore.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

Room gets cleaned but you find TV remote, phone charger etc on the floor ... no water bottles ... and when you escalate ... no use

Yesterday I asked for my regular Fresh Mango Juice with no added sugar from their restaurant downstairs ... I did feel that there was something not right about the same. It was absolutely clear when I found bottle lid plastic in my glass. They had served me bottled mango juice inspite of me asking for fresh juice. Trust me, plastic was not tasty either. So I am made to wait for 15 minutes just to be told that the manager is on break and that they ll revert in time. I have not heard from anyone. Oh yes, I was charged for that so called plastic juice .. or shall I say juice with plastic.

There are multitude instances in these two weeks ... and I would just say that their ratings are all set to go down as more people face issues and irresponsible attitude",Staff:Food

We were able to squeeze in a dip in their pool and outdoor jacuzzi which is beside their Samba restaurant.

Their gym is world-class and state-of-the-art, all two floors of it. They have an indoor basketball court and tennis courts and racquet ball courts. The kids even have their own playland.

"The Shangri-la has always been known for a blend of Asian service with contemporary luxury. This hotel didn’t disappoint. It’s only about 2 years old and the facilities and amenities reflect this. Everywhere is spotless and service is with a smile - even though we must have driven the staff up the wall as we organised a large whole-day event there.
The breakfast is amazing- worth getting up early for. And the gym is a huge- two-levels of equipment spaciously laid out. It’s a pity the trip was for business otherwise could take more time to enjoy all the facilities and food and beverage. The only peeve is the location as there’s not much around the hotel by way of shopping or transport networks. But it’s not a problem if the hotel is nice!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"After staying at the Makati Shangri-La twice, we decided to give the new property in BGC a try.

It is a beautiful, clean, modern hotel. The room was spacious and well-appointed. It has the most spectacular 2-story gym (Kerry Sports complex, attached to the hotel via skybridge), and there are two lovely swimming pools, one directly next to the hotel and the other across the skybridge as part of the gym complex - this was handy as the day progressed and the first pool became shaded, we moved to the other one still in the sun. As with other Shangri-La's, the breakfast buffet is huge. Service was good, though somewhat impersonal, being such a large hotel. I had a bit of difficulty cashing travelers checks at the desk, whereas it was no problem seven months earlier at the Makati location; not sure if it's a difference between the two properties or if they're just finally phasing out altogether (I hadn't used travelers checks in years, but was pleasantly surprised to find them useful in Manila.)

There are lots of good restaurants within walking distance, and Bonifacio High Street is a very nice open-air shopping mall to explore. The whole area, like the hotel, feels very new and clean, a world apart from the rest of Manila.

I still like Makati and the Shangri-La there, but it's definitely showing its age compared to BGC. Not sure which one we'll choose for our next visit!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"My husband and I stayed here because my husband is in Manila for work as a professional tattoo artist. He forgot his card and went up to the front desk to ask if he could go up.

Asked all the usual procedure questions of name, birthdate etc. My husband was questioned with suspicion and NOT allowed upstairs. He was so upset because the reception said he was not on the system, EVEN THOUGH our passports were handed in upon check in. After being INTERROGATED by the reception he refused, the guy at the front desk being so coy would call up, so he called me to come down. When I came down I spoke with the reception and after I pushed for an answer he just said there was something wrong with the information. Actually nothing was wrong with the information! The front desk just judged him on his tattoos and appearance and said he wasn't there. That was total BS. For some weird reason he said he would fix it on the spot, ""with no additional information i don't know how"". The man at concierge 'Jon', was kind enough to hear us out and the duty manager came to see us in the morning. We are very grateful for the follow up. But all the crap of being judged and discriminated, when for sure if my husband had been wearing a tie and was a skin shade lighter, we wouldn't have gone through that. It put such a damper on the rest of our stay. Please train your staff not to judge!! We stayed at the other two Shangri-la's in Makati and Edsa and the service was awesome with NO DISCRIMINATION! If you're a business guy for sure you will have a fantastic stay.",Staff
"Our one of a kind experience at Shangri-La the Fort is beyond expectation. It all began when my special someone really caught me completely off guard when our Grab driver turned his auto towards the drop-off point of Shangri-La the Fort instead of the other building I was originally briefed. We lodged for 3D2N and every moment of it was literally superb! Everything was perfect, starting from the day we entered their magnificent lobby and having been welcomed by their courteous employees. The suite that we stayed in was very comfortable and lovely! We were also mesmerised by all amenities the hotel has to offer! But let me tell you, aside from the sweet gesture they've done from a Birthday card and a cake sent to our chamber for my love love, the main highlight was when we both enjoyed the scrumptous breakfast buffets served at the High Street Cafe! I definitely recommend to every person who plans to visit Shangri-La, not to miss this chance. Rest assured, you will never feel sorry for waking up early in the morning for this matter.
Moreover, the only downside, I guess, would be realising that it's time to checkout at the hotel. It was such a great time staying at Shangri-La Hotel, truly amazing! We hope to come back soon.

P.S.
Just an FYI, I work within BGC's vicinity and no joke, every time I remember our stay and see the infrastructure, I suddenly gets blue. :-)",Food
"One of three Shangri-La hotels in Metropolitan Manila. You already have a sense of Shang hospitality the minute you step into the airport car: it has WiFi! Opened just two years ago, the rooms, of course, offer not luxury, but modern comfort (including an entry-level Toto loo with incorporated cold-water douchette) and are thoughtfully designed, with well-located electrical outlets, light switches, etc. The gym, on two stories, is well-equipped, gigantic, and open to non-resident members, some of whom come with their bodyguards. The buffet breakfast is plentiful and includes Pinoy delicacies, but unfortunately no adobo or balut. Service staff, while extraordinarily friendly, can be quite blurred on occasions (especially the men). Overall, one of the better hotels in Metro Manila.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

I booked another trip and stayed at the Shangri-la. They are in a convienant spot near my friends and good shopping, plus food. They picked me up from airport, walked me to my room and explained all amenities. I got sick the first day from eating too much in excitement & they had a nurse & doctor on call. After i felt better i went to their amazing gym and sauna. Room service is awesome. The maid service is great. Everyone is so friendly and always smiling like your family. This place is just heaven. Bed is comfortable and the lighting from the room for selfies are great!! They even printed a document for me from work so i could sign it & send it back. Im inlove!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

Access to kerrys sports facilities is a must try, it is the most exclusive gym in the metro. Great cocktail hour and amazing views at the lounge.

"This hotel is very new, modern and well-appointed. The buffet breakfast is great (and well worth it). Gym facilities are first class.

"First time in Manila on a short business trip and I felt right at home. With a perfect location, great ambience, awesome food and friendly staff I think I've got my go-to place to stay while in Manila.

Food: Tons of restaurants within walking distance from the side doors. Great breakfast in the hotel with lots of options.

Gym: 2 floors of workout space. One of the best gyms I've worked out in. Very well maintained.

Rooms: Clean, spacious, clean.. well equipped, clean.. ok you get it.

Location: A stroll to the office and to the nearby Makati area. If you need to travel elsewhere then plan early in the day as the peak hour traffic is brutal.

Overall, a great place to stay!",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Attended a conference yesterday. They had a special check in room for the delegates. Arrived at around 1 pm and finally got a room just before 4 pm. Others had to wait much longer. To make up for the check in fiasco, the management has allowed us late check out.
The room was nice and they provided us with lots of free bottled water.
Breakfast, however, was another nightmare. The line was so long that it reached the middle of the lobby. Inside the dining area, you had to be resourceful to get a plate or a bowl as these kept running out. Choices for breakfast was plentiful, you just had to wait for new plates to come out before you can get hold of the food.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I'll start with the experience of entering the hotel. First you need to go through metal detectors. This is a bit of a pain.

The next thing that strikes you is the smell. It's wonderful.

The open reception is opulent with a huge hanging chandelier.

The staff are friendly and approachable. If you're like me and like to do things yourself they can sometimes a bit too friendly.

The rooms are brilliant with amazing views.

The Raging Bull bar is great with some amazing cocktails mixed by an expert.

"This is a first class hotel located in a really nice area for site seeing and shopping. Great restaurants located everywhere. Check-in was smooth, polite and efficient. We never touched our luggage as everything was taken care of and delivered to our room. The room itself was on the 19th room and on a corner, so we have two large windows to see the views. The room was large with plenty of space and light and the bathroom was located around the corner from where the main bed and floor area was, so it made it feel like you had an apartment, minus the kitchen! Our room rate included daily breakfast which was fantastic with a great selection of food. Service was also why above par. If you are in a rush and want to skip a sit down breakfast then they have the option of ""grab and go"", where you can load up on fresh fruit, pastries, and sandwiches. We opted for this once and it was very handy. In room dining has good selection of food and we were very pleased with the quality and taste. We ordered a noodle dish and it was excellent. The hotel property is very large with connecting high end shops and separate sports/pool and workout areas. Large indeed. Shopping and restaurants are all within walking distance, basically right out the hotel. The area is clean and safe. Would certainly what to go back again!!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

The main feature I liked about this hotel was the dining . Breakfast is superb with an excellent variety and they offer a superb buffet . I invited my business partner and his family and they ate like they were starving !
The food was a mixture of Philippino , Asian and international cuisine . Service was reasonable . Prices are not cheap , but worth the experience.",Food:Value for money
"Stayed here for a family celebration. It is located in the middle of BGC, Manila's most premiere financial and commercial center. The complex is massive and very top of the line with all the high end shops and food establishments surrounding it. Service is also top notch,all the people from the security guards and the front desk staff were very nice and accomodating. The rooms were very well appointed and beds were comfy. Breakfast buffet was the best with a very generous spread of breakfast staples, pastries and deserts. (though i hoped they refilled the bacon more often). The fitness center is a destination by itself with an expansive two storey space. Also worth noting is the kids play area, although a little pricey but is very well appointed and entertaining for big kids as well. The pool area is also very relaxing and soothing but water is quite frigid. All in all this is the ultimate dream destination for vacationers, businessmen and traveling workers. It is an all in one destination and you do not even need to leave the hotel. Hope someday I could come back.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

It was also a nice touch that they feature our worldclass chocolates and dried fruit from Davao to welcome a guest in the room.
Breakfast at High Street Cafe had a good international selection. I also liked the hip uniforms of the waitstaff.
I also enjoyed the beautiful 3-D art installations in the lobby and elsewhere.

"This was our first time to stay here for a business event. We were looking forward to staying here since we are regular patrons of EDSA Shangri-La. Also have been to Makati Shangri-La and Shangri-La Rasa Sentosa and they are all charming. At first glance the place is very opulent, almost intimidating. Our baggage was swiftly handled by a very kind and friendly staff, i wish i asked his name so i could mention it here! While we were checking in I think he could tell our son was getting impatient so he started chatting him up and keeping him preoccupied, it may not seem like much but i REALLY appreciated his effort. I also asked him where the pool and adventure zone was located and he was very knowledgeable and all smiles.
The room was spacious, very clean and well lit. We were on the 34th floor and it offered a spectacular view of the city. The bathroom was spotless and had L’occitane toiletries. Lovely! Breakfast and dinner were fantastic, as expected from Shangri-La. We didn’t have lunch there though.

We checked out the gym it is amazing! Very well equipped. The pool is gorgeous. The only comment i have is the adventure zone. Why do they charge 600 for hotel guests isn’t that supposed to be free??? If i read it correctly i think it said 600 for 5 hours or something like that. That is actually very reasonable but still, why charge for guests that are checked in? Also we only had about an hour and a half left before checking out so I wasn’t going to fork out that amout for such a short amount of time.

Other than that, this hotel is truly fabulous. As expected from Shangri-La hotels.",Staff:Food

I was amazed and really thankful for the services rendered by your Restaurant crew at the High Street Cafe particulary Noel, Lois and Erica.

Great staff and customer service. The Kerry gym was fantastic! But beware...amenities in bathroom like shampoo n conditioner as well as the coffee and tea packets will only be replenished for a fee! Luckily I bring my own toiletries, but for the price i paid for me and my 4 other family members, these should be included. The breakfast buffet at the High Street Cafe was delish w/ so much variety. Altho, if u go in close to the end, they run out of the more popular items like fresh mangoes.

Had the pleasure of staying here for one night on January 4th on a layover and experienced the warmest and most genuine service from every member of staff I met. Some high end hotels provide the utmost professionalism but lack real connection and human emotions when interacting with their guests but this hotel was both efficient and professional with the great addition of a really non judgemental and sincerely caring and gracious staff.

The rooms were not massive, but beautifully appointed, bathrooms were excellent and the buffet breakfast magnificent. The staff were super helpful, when I realized that I had forgotten my cufflinks for an important presentation they lent me some ( the staff at the Hudson when asked for a travel adaptor offered to sell me one). The gym and spa were excellent and the car service to and from the airport efficient. For a business hotel it was near faultless.",Staff:Food:Location

Some of the dining choices in the restaurant leave a lot to be desired, but given the location of the hotel there are many choices in the area so not an issue.",Location:Food
"I had a one night stay at the hotel before heading back to London and I think the hotel is amazing. Beautiful inside and out. The service was outstanding and I love the comfortable bed and the L'occitane toiletries too.

Unfortunately, there was a dead spot for wifi internet in the swimming pool area. I queried about this and apparently, hotel staff have been made aware of this from other guests but they did nothing. I wasn't impressed. How hard was it to get a wifi extender? I don't think it costs that much and I don't think owner Robert Kuok would be very happy either when existing hotel amenities issues are not being resolved swiftly!

I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't due to the wifi issues. I hope this gets sorted out asap.

The staff is super friendly and the food is amazing, both by choice and quality. RJ and Dave made sure we tried every specialty and sent us off with almost more smiles than we could handle.

"This is my 2nd review in one calendar year. I usually don’t do this , but I have to thank a certain number of people, and I hope management recognise them in the near future . First , I had a successful staging of my daughter’s 18th birthday celebration at the Bonifacio Hall . Spearheaded by event supervising head miss Divina, and mr Angelo , it was a well coordinated activity. With their staff , from Realyn , Winston , Jay and Angelyn it was quite astonishing how these people seem to handle more than 80 guests with good precision.
Another memorable experience was those in the Horizon Club at the topmost floor. Never mind that they don’t serve afternoon tea , I hardly noticed it with the way their staff made my stay their memorable most of the time with their friendly and attentive service . I want to recommend all of them . I’m sorry I can’t get all of their names but I would like to specify Kathryn who made the initiative to reserve a private room for my toddler, and because my daughter spoke highly of during her brief stay with her friends . And Gael , who was the only one on duty during late night but managed to anticipate my needs for some extra snacks while I was having coffee.
Staying at the Premiere suite was another memorable one. Very huge , spacious, elegant and functional. Splurging once in a while, I won’t mind if I am staying in a beautiful abode .
Congratulations Shangri-La at the Fort ,it has never cease to amaze me. Even though I own a condo unit in One Serendra, I won’t hesitate staying in this exemplary hotel. Till next time .",Staff:Food
"Prior to this visit was an event that I prganized and gave a 5 star for the treatment, this time it was a family holiday stay-cation and it was indeed a fantastic place to stay. Upon our arrival, they have this 24 hour email from their Guest Service Office which allow personalize request for the convenience of those who are staying. Having kids, request like in-room dining and breakfast were facilitated ahead. The Bellman and concierge (Xandro Pincaro and James Segismundo) were very helpful, nice and pleasant. I love the energy of Joy Pascua from High Street Cafe and the service given by Tony Molon. Made sure I got their full name correct because I know I’ll be making another review here and it was another fantastic experience. Options of 2 swimming pools is good because the one near Samba has more people and if you want a more private one then you can go at 6th floor at Kerrys Sports. It was nice to see Joey of Kerry Sports. What’s another good thing thing about the hotel is that it’s very near to BGC High Street and Mind Museum. Raging Bull Burger is the best and you should try it! Over all, it’s another 5 star!!!",Location:Food:Staff
"We enjoyed our New Year's weekend here. First, we are thankful to Shang for having a New Year's mass held at the hotel.
Second, this must be the most baby-friendly hotel in Manila. From the moment they opened our car doors, everyone from Shang was genuinely warm not just to us adults but to our 2 little boys as well. Every area at the hotel is stroller-friendly, and we moved about with so much ease.
Third, there's so much to do here for everyone. The recreational areas and facilities are really unparalled. The indoor basketball court is really impressive! The fitness center has 2 floors! There's even a very large indoor playground for the kids.
Fourth, the food is good -- buffet breakfast had a huge selection. Both Raging Bull Chophouse and Raging Bull Burgers have great-tasting and fresh food.

The included buffet breakfast sets a very high standard. Even coming down at 9.30 when it finishes at 10 there was masses of choices. We also used the lounge to meet up with friends. Gracious space with art works and a stunning hanging glass installation. The afternoon tea looked good but we were still full from breakfast. A pianist played some classical and contemporary pieces. Son in law used the gym which he said was well equipped. A good location with quite a few restaurants around the outer perimeter. We dined in at the Raging Bull which was superb.

Room service for breakfast was prompt and delicious. Great spot too - easy walking up Bonifacio High St for many shopping and dining options.
The pool area was nice although the weather turned and I didn’t experience it much (and I was there for work). The gym was awesome - 2 storied, plenty of weights, treadmills and other machines. And in the men’s change room was a spa, plunge pool, steam room and sauna. I assume the woman’s had all that too. Great place to chill for a bit especially if it was raining outside.

I also read that guests can enjoy Adventure Zone for free, but sadly it's not. I find the fee a lil expensive. Maybe we'll just avail of the membership.

The real highlight though is the staff, who go out of their way to assist you. I foolishly left my one pair of heels in a taxi, and one of the Shangri-La team escorted me to the nearest shops where I could find another pair. Definitely above and beyond service.

If you're looking to host an event here, the event facilities and staff are excellent too.

Room is very warmly designed and spacious. The bed is very comfy and the view is not bad (city view).
Staff's attitude is nice with 5* standard. Just the efficiency of the staff is needed to be improved. (I ordered an Earl Grey in lobby lounge. After 15mins they gave me a Black Tea, I asked for the correct one and they finally delivered to me after another 15mins).

"I tagged along to my parents when they stayed here, since my work was just a block away from the hotel.

I arrived after work and headed for the lounge on the top floor. Since I was an added guest, we paid Php 1500 for me to have access for this and breakfast later on. While the assortment was limited, I still liked it, since they had tapas, cold cuts and desserts. They also offered (alcoholic) beverages. Since the lounge food was only until 7PM, I eventually just asked if I could finish off the strawberries that were meant to be topped on some dessert.

The hotel guests have access to the huge gym as well, and since my parents were too tired, I got to go instead. It was huge! They had a pool separate from the actual hotel and squash rooms and a tennis court. I went at about 10PM, so not many people and no classes for me to take. The sauna and steam room closes at 10PM, but I dipped my calves and feet in the still-hot jacuzzi instead.

Morning breakfast was good in the lounge, while selection still limited, the view was great. You get to order from the menu and they have a breakfast buffet.

Our family usually frequents EDSA Shang, and the rooms in the Fort go for a few thousands higher than in EDSA, but the Fort one was still enjoyable. Everything felt shiny and new and the staff was helpful and pleasant and accommodating. The hotel itself is walking distance to anything you'll need to get to in the Fort, so it would be good for both tourists and business travelers.

Got to work feeling refreshed and well-rested. Would probably try this out again on a non-working day to fully use all the amenities.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"A hotel only truly deserves their stripes when it can connect with its guests emotionally. Shang at the Fort, to me, has done just that.

This is my first stay and I am blown away by the ambience, cleanliness, and genuine service. The staff extended themselves to cater to my vegetarian requirements. If they lack in experience, they definitely make it up with superb attentive attitude. Worthy of mention is Rey of Concierge who helped me to with my transportation and last minute shopping request, Hubert at High Street Cafe who has the mega movie star smile while he made the best fresh juice concoction, Jeffrey of Samba who arranged specially made not in the menu vegetarian dishes..

The in room dining staff who delivered pots of coffee to me in the morning (fastest inroom and housekeeping response time, compared to other hotels in other countries).

Well done guys!",Staff:Food
"Big and quiet rooms, excellent beds, all the amenities that you could need, spotless clean everywhere, high class service, a two level gym, incredible breakfast...am I missing something?

But we were surprised because the moment they knew it was our anniversary.. we have a cake waiting in our room and for breakfast also.. that made us feel special.
The room was pristinely clean, bathroom smells good and the bed.. you can sleep all day.
The breakfast buffet at High Street Cafe was delicious and so many choices.. try the champorado with dilis!!!

"I have been regularly using this hotel throughout the year and cannot fault it, it's a true 5 star hotel and this is due to the staff!

This is less of a hotel review and more a well deserving mention to a front line member of staff named Xandro.

I recommend you get to know him early as his knowledge of the local area and further afield is invaluable - He has helped me out on numerous occasions with a wide range of different scenarios and has always come out on top!

Im always met by Xandro upon arrival at the hotel entrance, he's easy to spot as he towers above his colleagues but more noticably is always smiling. He is extremely attentive, honest, trustworthy and professional yet still funny and a real asset to the Shangri-La Team. The Shangri-La at The Fort, Manila experience wouldn't be the same without him!

"Stayed in the Shang for my birthday weekend with my family and was welcomed with a nice touch of birthday cake and greeting card, it was really nice and thoughtful! The shang is still fairly new and you can smell it in the rooms, it has that fresh paint/smoke smell but not really that annoying, we booked 3 rooms with king/deluxe types and they were all designed in a luxurious manner, they use L'occitane for the bath amenities too. Bathroom is huge but no bidet. We planned on joining a class from Kerry Sports but got too lazy to wake up but my goodie it was one of the best gym I've seen! I don't even know if you can call it a gym! More like a sports hotel! They have everything, yoga room, spin room, basketball, squash and tennis courts! I'm seriously thinking of being a member! We didn't try their breakfast but we tried the dinner buffet in the High Street Cafe and it was awesome, it was my second time in the High Street Cafe and it never disappoint, the dessert station is heaven for those with sweet tooth!!! Most buffets have big selection of dessert but lacks the quality, High Street Cafe isn't one of those. Sugar-Free Davao Dark Chocolate Ice Cream - try this!!! Don't go out of HSC without trying this !!!

More than the luxurious space and good food, what I appreciate the most is the people and their hospitality, kudos to the crew of High Street Cafe especially Noel!

"I booked an overnight stay at Shangri-la at the Fort Mania for my friend's post-birthday celebration. It was a last-minute endeavor due to scheduling conflicts. Despite that, it was an awesome time as my friend was so pleased with our corner room assignment. Joanne of Front Desk was very helpful and check-in was a breeze, thanks to the endorsement by Service Manager Oliver Panabe, whom I used to deal with in Edsa Shangri-la. ALloyd my amenities were complete when I checked into the room so I headed off to High Street Cafe for a late lunch while waiting for my friend. There, I was attended to by Brandon who walked me through the different food stations. I started off with the Nyonya Chicken and roasted Korean-spiced meat recommended by Chef Ronnie. The flavorful roasted meats were paired with the fresh vegetable salad greens thoughtfully served by Chef Hubert. This healthy lunch was complimented by the delectable pork ribs sinigang (tamarind-flavored sour soup common in Filipino dishes) served by Brandon. Service Manager Kevin offered and helped me transfer to a booth which offers a good view of the sidestreet, a perfect spot to sip the hot soup on a drizzly Saturday afternoon. Kevin even offered a steaming bowl of Laksa, which tasted comparably better than what I ate in Changi Airport. I also partook of the roast pork from Chef Michael which went very well with the pickled veggies side dish. I thought I was full but Joan encouraged me to try the blueberry ice cream which she also paired with the Davao Malagos chocolate flavored scoop. I was so glad I did that I asked for a 2nd serving from Kevin. Noel was so considerate to offer a cup of cappuccino to help digest the very filling meal. It was a delightful lunch thanks to the very scrumptious selections and the congenial service from Kevin, Brandon, Chef Hubert, Chef Ronnie, Chef Michael, Joan, Noel.

Our room was also kept in spic and span state by Room Attendant John I could literally sleep in the bathroom floor.

After hearing the Saturday mass and grabbing a light dinner, we headed to the Health Club where Tricia and David patiently walked us through (this being both our first time as I'm more familiar with Edsa Shangri-la, being a 7-minute walk from my apartment). The gym equipment are equally clean as well as the sauna and steam rooms. I felt so squeaky clean after showering.

For some reason,my room key didn't work so I had it reprogramed by Anton who promptly fixed the glitch.

After a restful sleep, we had breakfast at High Street Cafe. Despite the steady stream of diners due to the hotel's high occupancy, Brandon seated us in a booth section for more space. Lester served to us grapefruit and orange slices for a healthy start. Raymart
concocted my friend's request for ham, veggie and cheese omelette. Kevin kindly offered the Sunday paper for my daily news fix. Thanks too to Kitchen Helper Dane for the help in getting my extra rice (I am a certified carbo-loader) Also, Joy graciously took our pictures for my friend's digital album. Joan also delighted my friend when she served the same delectable blueberry ice cream I had the day before and my friend was equally hooked.

We observed the same amiable demeanor by Chef Hubert, Chef Ronnie, Chef Michael, Brandon, Kevin, Joan, Lester and Joy to other diners in the adjoining tables. This proves the consistently excellent service orientation by said team members

At checkout, we had the pleasure of being assisted by Lyle and Joanne, who patiently walked us through the bill charges. My friend profusely thanked me for her invigorating stay, thanks to the help of these team members.

Thanks also to JP for helping us with our car serice after check-out.

Most likely, I will come back for my own birthday getaway or a post New Year celebration. Thank you Shangri-la at the Fort Manila for a habit forming experience.",Staff:Food

"When you have 2 small kids and 2 big kids you'd want to book a place that can accommodate the needs of all your kids.

First off, this was a staycation for my daughter's birthday. The 2 bedroom suite greeted us w Adventure Zone backpacks; sweater; jogging pants; a teepee; sleeping bags for my 2 kids. They of course loved it off the bat.

For my teens, Kerry Sports Gym! Have you seen the gym?! If you reside in Manila, this could easily be the best gym in the Metro.

The pool side is so-so, just small fountains for the kiddie side. No slides nor playgrounds at the pool side. The sandwiches offered is decent/good.

Rooms are spacious. Sheets are of course clean and comfortable.

I booked directly with Shangri-la and informed them about my kid's birthday...

It was an awesome experience for all of us. Will definitely stay there again.

"This is my second stay at Shangri-La at the Fort, BGC. It is little far from downtown Makati, but it is worth it if we want to be away from the daily downtown heavy traffic. BGC is close to major highways and many multinational companies have offices in this new neighborhood. It is newer alternative than the one in EDSA.

BGC is definitely US-style community with plenty shopping choices.

The hotel gives very good service over all, but the rate is bit high.
Customer service is always prioritized.

Breakfast buffet quality is Shangri-La standard. However, one morning, I was asking the staff for a window booth. She pointed one section of the window booths will be reserved. I asked what time because I did not see Reserved sign. She said ""8:30"", and I said ""it is now only 7 AM."" She was embarrassed and said that ""it is just for your information..."".

I enjoy the traditional Filipino food selections, especially the baked goods.

The room is well maintained, and housekeeping is always helpful ready to assist. One complaint is that there is still chemical (new paint) smell in the room and hallway.

The Club lounge is very good. The food and service quality are Shangri-La standard.

"For a while, I was kind of depressed that Taguig City had no 5-star hotels. But this Shangri-La at the Fort changed all that. Now I do look forward to staying here.

Location: Right within the modernized Bonifacio Global City area, and walking distance to lots of eateries as well as shopping areas. This hotel has a rather large floor area for hosting events so one can actually ""stay"" within the compound and not go out if one chooses to.

Room: The room was conservative and clean. Very comfortable bedding and nice working desk. Room amenities were typical of Shangri-La. I was on roomed on a higher floor so had relatively good views. 5☆

Two things disappointed me:
1. The housekeeping staff was a bit shoddy and kept forgetting to replace tea and coffee.
2. The room wifi was iffy - I ended up using my own mobile data plan instead.
3☆

Gym: This was the biggest hotel gym I had ever ventured into. 2 floors. Lots of modern equipment, lots of space. I was told it was where the celebrities hang out, although I did not noticed any. Very impressive. Made me worked out much, much longer than I normally would. 5☆

Restaurant: The breakfast restaurant seemed to go on forever - very long and yet very full/popular. The spread is awesome - really wide enough to go from breakfast till dinner for those who live to eat only. 5☆

Overall, one will be pleased staying in this hotel, which was clearly targeted for the upper-end crowd.

The pool dedicated for hotel guest in now open and beside it is a restaurant Samba and there are also more food options in and outside the hotel. Check in process was a breeze and the attendant at the front desk was very cheerful, upon knowing we are celebrating 2 birthdays, she probably immediately called house keeping to provide something special inside our room as we were greeted with 2 birthday cakes and treats for the celebrants. Housekeeping services was also very attentive, all request we asked for were immediately delivered to our room. We also availed of the spa treatment at the Kerry Sports Center, they have a very good massage as we felt very relax after our treatment. And while we did our massage, our kids played inside the huge Adventure Zone where they enjoyed going down the huge slides and obstacle courses.

"I've stayed at the 3 Shangri-Las here in the Philippines and they were all of high quality in terms of comfort, luxury and service. This latest property (just a year old at time of writing) is no exception and is certainly welcome considering that the others are showing their ages.

The room we got was at the 40th floor, which gave us the additional perk of accessing the Horizon Club at the same level for afternoon cocktails (which we missed as we checked in late) and less-crowded breakfast buffet (more on this later). Anyway our room for me was PERFECT if only for one simple thing: the pillows! For so many times I have stayed in hotels which were otherwise fine but I did not get a good night's sleep because the pillows provided all gave me neck strain the morning after. Sure they're big, clean and fluffy but lay your head on them and soon they flatten out and you're sleeping like without any pillow at all. I mean, what good is a hotel if you can't get quality sleep? Finally Shang the Fort nailed it! Haha!

The rest of the room was splendid - bed's firmness just right, the bathroom roomy with complimentary L'Occitane bath toiletries, 6 bottles of mineral water, a well-stocked mini-bar, in-room safe, cartridge type coffee maker, HD cable TV, free wifi, Bluetooth speaker (now that's a first) and even complimentary office supplies - paper clips, stapler, highlighters, etc. - for the business traveler.

Now for the breakfast buffet. As mentioned we had ours at the Horizon Club which we were told the spread is not as extensive as the regular buffet downstairs but that's OK, we still had more than our usual fill. They had the usual variety of breads, cereals, salads, fresh fruits, cold meat cuts and cheeses plus some local fare. On top of these, you may order how you want your eggs made, request for plain or garlic rice, etc. - at no extra charge.

What made my breakfast more special was one of the receptionists conversed with me, addressing me by name, asking how my stay was so far, if I have used the pool, gym, spa and the other hotel amenities, if I partook of their cocktails and for how many days was I booked. I was hoping she'd asked for my cell no. but that would have been wishful of me.

"This is a re-posting of a review accepted in January but taken in July by TA My reviews are generally thorough and as balanced as possible.

The Shangri-La at Fort was the venue for a university class reunion and I had a mostly-enjoyable 4-night stay. There was much to like but several aspects of the experience that left something to be desired.

The good about the hotel
1. Impressive soaring lobby
2. Large bedrooms and bathrooms. Comfortable beds
3. Breakfast buffet at High Street Cafe: classmates had raved about the buffet during the lead-up to the reunion and the quality and variety of the offerings was truly impressive. If a guest unfortunately has to leave before the buffet opens, the hotel can arrange for a grab-bag and coffee to be delivered to the room
4. New structure, clean, contemporary
5. Excellent sports facilities at Kerry. I swam and made use of the covered tennis courts
6. Appreciated the anticipatory emails from the hotel that inquired as to my needing transfers from the airport. Other email inquires on my part were answered quite promptly, within 24 hrs.
7. Excellent ballroom facility. Excellent food service during the gala.
8. Good location in BGC at one end of High Street.
9. Complimentary and reliable wifi: a welcome amenity
10. Opportunity for feedback on follow-up email

The not-so-good about the Shang-at-the-Fort
1. Lack of seating in the lobby when waiting for other guests or waiting to be picked up
2. Plumbing problems during the stay (more on this later)
3. Tendency of buffet breakfast to be overwhelmed by guests at about 0830 and especially by 0900 (more on this too later)
4. Lack of a sense of location; for all the grandeur I never sensed I was in Manila or the Philippines when inside (more, too, on this below)

Other reviews had mentioned ongoing noisy construction which I fortunately did not encounter. What marked my stay was a plumbing snafu during my second night. There had been a plumbing problem affecting the hotel overnight and, when I woke up early at 0500 I found a piece of paper had been slipped under my door stating that there would be no water from 0230 - 0430. There was water in my room but no hot water. Fortunately the cold water was not as that here in the Midwest during winter and was quite tolerable. One of my classmates was not as fortunate and had not water at all and were taken to unoccupied rooms to shower. When I got back much later that night I still had no hot water; I called guest relations and a plumber came up and fixed the problem promptly. Nevertheless this was not what one expects to have to deal with at any Shang property.

Another unpleasant experience had to do with the breakfast buffet. One some mornings I had to leave even before the buffet opened and was able to avail of the grab-and-go option in the lobby where I could pick up coffee and a brown paper bag of pastry and fruit. One morning I had a relatively early breakfast at the buffet; I had no problems getting in and enjoying breakfast. On the next morning however I had a later start after playing tennis and swimming and found myself in line at 9AM with a crowd of fellow-guests hoping for breakfast. Several were families who had made reservations for 8:45, 9:00, and 9:15 yet could not be admitted into High Street Café because tables were not available. Our names and room numbers were recorded on small pieces of paper by two nervously-smiling young women obviously overwhelmed by upset guests, in particular parents with hungry children. It was a bad scene. Another

Regarding the lack of sense of place: there were no paintings or photos of the city or country and no Filipino artwork that I could identify. Now I understand that this may be a corporate decision to maintain a degree of homogeneity and familiarity amongst all Shang properties perhaps for the comfort of guest who frequently stay with them. I am also not looking for 'kitsch"" that would interfere or clash with the ambiance but surely some tasteful décor that would remind guests that they are in the Philippines/Manila could be arranged. This is, of course, seen from the perspective of a ""Balikbayan"" visiting from the US. Guests from the Philippines certainly do not need - nor may they want - such reminders. I also concede that High Street location, pleasant as the place may be, it does not particularly evoke Filipino culture and tradition, such that the Shang interior design does match its location.

The Kerry Sports facility was impressive. I know some of my classmates took advantage of the treadmill. The indoor complex was impressive. I took advantage of the pool and the covered tennis court. I was able to arrange 1 hour of hitting with their pro at a day's notice. The lap pool experienced by a dramatic vista of surrounding high-rises. The facility staff, as expected, were friendly and helpful.

To the managers at the Shang, hopefully the breakfast buffet arrangements have been made more efficient. I had made some suggestions regarding the line for the breakfast in my original post - most of which was saved on Word but not my suggestions, unfortunately - that included offering coffee to adults and pastries to their children to keep hunger pangs at bay while waiting. I also appreciated your response to my post at the time.

There was no problem with the original review and it was accepted right away. The term that I believe very belatedly triggered a TA rejection is one used by the travel industry for a hotel that opens for business before has completed its facilities. My initial re-post had no insulting language nor any opinions about any ""wider social issues"" and commented solely on the editorial process of TA.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Shangri La Fort is now fully operational as opposed to my first stay the week after it opened. I booked on an app as it was 50% of the price quoted for the same room by our usual travel agent. That said I made a mistake and entered the wrong dates, I am deeply indebted to the hotel management for altering my reservation for me for what was supposed to be a non changeable booking - as I was arriving the following day.

Check in was excellent. My room had been upgraded to a suite which was luxurious to say the least. Nice seating area with plenty of space in the room to relax. Being a diamond member of Golden circle that allowed me access to the Horizon Club on the top floor. Wow - magnificent views in all directions. Very relaxing for drinks and snacks all day and happy hour in the evening. Great free wifi throughout the hotel. Nicely air conditioned in all areas.

Buffet restaurant on the main level offered one of the most comprehensive breakfast buffets I have seen. Unlike the Shangri La Makati, it is not overcrowded and noisy at weekends - some local loyalty card gives Filipinos free food at weekends at Shangri La Makati, which was one of our company's reasons for not using that hotel any more - far too noisy with children everywhere, especially at breakfast . Rest assured, Shangri La Fort is a far superior dining experience.

Quite a different style to the classic Shangrila. Very good business standard hotel with massive fitness centre.,Comfort & Facilities:Food
"The rooms of this hotel is better than EDSA Shangrila. Maybe because this is relatively new. But the feel of the room is so cozy but with a touch of being in a business set up.

The food choices is also good. The cafe where we had breakfast has lots of food choices. The best part of it was the cheese and fruit station which had sweet mangoes. Wow!!!

The best part of my stay is the staff's attitudes. They are so courteous and very helpful. My stay was a breeze.",Food:Location:Staff
"It is our first time to stay in a Shangrila Hotel, and we werent disappointed with our short stay. From the check in to check out, all staff were very courteous to their guests.
Hotel room we stayed in were more then what we expected, spacious, clean and homey.
Food served durinf breakfast were all good and fresh. The staff were also attentive to the needs of the diners.
Thumbs up to The Fort Shangrila Hotel! Will definitely be back :)",Staff:Food:Cleanliness
"This is a nice newish hotel in the BGC area of Manila.

The rooms were nice, spacious and modern. Bathrooms were on the small side but was well lit and had nice L'Occitane toiletries.

The hotel has the most amazing gym, Kerry Sports Manila. This place has everything you'll ever want/need in a gym, including a full basketball court.

I loved Samba restaurant. The Chef was friendly and met guests, and service at the restaurant was great.

Service was good, particularly with the front desk and security staff. There was one incident where I asked them to have a bday cake delivered to my nephew's room as it was his bday. I spelled his name and went over it a couple of times with the person who took the order. First of all they forgot about the cake until I called them to ask where it was, then they delivered a cake with a completely wrong/different name... they did fix it in the end with a new cake but would have been nice if they paid attention to start with.

Overall I recommend this place if you're staying at BGC.

"The Lobby bar
- It is a comfortable place to work, meet friends, conduct business, or simply unwind from a long day. Service is swift and straight forward which I thought was a bit 3 to 4 star in my opinion. However, the over all experience was great and I would go back not because of service and food but because of the ambiance and feel of the space.

The Buffet
- The buffet is a wonderful experience. It was a delight to visit. The food was amazing and the service unparalleled. The design and layout is quite unique. I design and build restaurants for a living and the way the food stalls and seating areas are laid out make you feel like you are always on a journey for food! I will come back during my next visit in mid June.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We all know the drill, you're away because you have to be. But this is a really nice hotel, and made being away much more enjoyable. Compared to the other hotels I've stayed at in Manila, this is the place. The gym is now the best gym (Kerry Fitness Center) I've seen in a hotel and I'm struggling to think of a better one not in a hotel. The rooms are very comfortable, great bed, lightning internet, and there is an impressive selection of restaurants the Chophouse is a standout, great NYC theme, but comes aross as having it's own confidence. Call out to ""Butch the Butcher"" who was very knowledgeable and very professional in his service.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"We had our first staycation at Shangri-La Fort during the long weekend, and it was overall a great stay. What's commendable is how responsive and helpful the staff is, if you have any problems or questions they are quick to act and make sure it's taken cared of. The aesthetics of the hotel are great, the room is impressive, nice toiletries too which are from L'Occitane. I'm particularly happy with the ultra comfy bed guaranteed to give you restful sleep, and no itchiness even for those who are sensitive to bed bugs! Room service food was yummy too. The only problem we had was the breakfast. Somehow they didn't anticipate or prepare for the number of guests that we had to wait in line for a ridiculously long time in High Street café (around 30-45 minutes!). It was really a disappointment and we've never had that experience in any other hotels. If they could prevent this from happening I'd give them 5 stars.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Can't help but compare it to edsa shangrila, from the lobby, to check in, to the cleanliness of the room and the warmness of the staff, they're at par.
My kids love it, they enjoyed all the facilities specially the adventure zone ( there's entrance fee even you're an in house guest), the pool ( there's jacuzzi) rooms are spotless and spacious, beds are comfy, bathroom is big with bath tub, a separate shower and toilet area. Staff are very accommodating and nice. Breakfast is really wow, so much choices. It's hard for the kids to leave, they really want to come back. And for sure we will.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I was staying here on a work trip so sadly was working 12-15 hours a day but my time in the hotel more than compensated for that. Great gym, several pools and tennis courts etc but the main thing for me was the room.
Everything was spotless and kept that way throughout, and the staff couldn't be more helpful from the receptionists, to the security and restaurant staff. This was just what you want from a 5* hotel, thanks!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Me and my partner chose this hotel to celebrate my birthday, we wanted to indulge ourselves in luxury and class for the occasion, and the Shangdi-la at the Fort did not disappoint! The check-in went smoothly and rapidly, we even got early check-in! The reception staff very pleasant and professional.

Arriving at the room, we were pleasantly surprised by the size and location, we got a beautiful corner room with two sets of windows, inviting to a beautiful view of the city. We also discovered a small cake and birthday card, we were surprised because this was the day before my birthday, but yet ever so appreciated. On my birthday we received a big cake, nicely decorated and an even nicer birthday card, beyond any expectations we might have had. Truly a nice and appreciated gesture!

The room is beautifully decorated, bed very comfortable, gorgeous bathroom with all toiletries you would need and expect. Complimentary wi-fi access. We do not agree with the negative remarks on the rooms, rest assured that you will be satisfied with the rooms.

As the complex in which the hotel resides is new, there are areas still under development and some minor construction / maintenance work is being done, but it did not interfere nor create any discomfort at all. Great location for shopping and dining, nice shopping street across the street from the hotel.

We have no complaints or reservations about this hotel, and we would gladly recommend fellow travelers to stay here.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"The room rate was high. But with the service given by the receptionist who assist us and concierge by Elisa was outstanding. The room was big and nice view. The gym is incredible state of the art gym, the biggest hotel gym with 2 floors I've ever seen, Impressive! The breakfast buffet made this hotel different from the others. Live cooking, Chinese station, bread station, dessert Station, american Station, noodle soup station, Korean station, and grab a way stand who wants to grab a food and drinks outside the streets.",Food
"The service was superb, the staff went above and beyond my expectations. My husband was not feeling well so I asked for medicine, they gave us one and even sent their nurse to check if he is okey. Jec from the front desk attended to all of my requests. The dinner and breakfast buffet is also very good and value for money. The amenities and the gym is the best in all of the hotels in metro manila. The room also looks good and inviting.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Staff are amazing. The room was beautiful and luxurious. Every staff i met was friendly and helpful with highest hospitality. Each morning and evening i were greeted by the most gracious hosts which is a plus to me and to make me more feel comfortable and valued. As a golden circle member, i really enjoyed the privilges and its all worth it. Thanks for making my holiday memorable. Highly recommend this hotel and definitely will come back again.",Staff
"Driving up to the main lobby, you can already tell that this is not like any of the other luxury hotels in Manila. It’s evident as soon as you enter that no expense was spared in designing this property– marble, gilded furniture, beautiful artwork, and a massive crystal chandelier greet you. The interior is definitely more modern compared to the other Shangri-La properties we’ve been to in Asia.

On our stay, we booked one of their Horizon Deluxe High-Street View rooms which was conveniently on the same floor as the Horizon Lounge. Our room was bright and airy with muted beige tones whereas older Shangri-La properties tend to be a bit darker with all the dark wood finishes. In true Shangri-La manner, the bedding and duvet was luxurious with a surfeit of cloud-like pillows. Everything about our room was well-appointed.

This property's Horizon Lounge is probably one of the best Shangri-La lounges we’ve been to. The lounge has meeting rooms guests can use and lots of comfortable seating space for the leisure guests who just wants to take in the view of Manila over a glass of bubbly and eat-all-you-can Jamon Iberico– Yes, they have a full leg of Jamon Iberico during cocktail hour.

Even though a lot of good restaurants are available nearby, we felt that leaving the hotel to dine was unnecessary when the Shangri-La at the Fort offers a good selection of dining experiences: Steak lovers will enjoy a large selection of premium grilled items as well as an extensive selection of wines and cocktails at the über chic Raging Bull Chophouse & Bar; Ceviches and other Peruvian dishes can be enjoyed at the pool-side restaurant, Samba; Canton Road for modern Chinese fare.

During our dinner at Raging Bull Chophouse & Grill, we briefly chatted with the hotel’s F&B Manager, Simon Côté, about the wines they carry and about the other 2 dining establishments opening soon in the property: Limitless, which will be a lounge; and Raging Bull Burgers. When we got back to our room from dinner, we got a pleasant surprise(a bottle of bubbly and truffles) from Simon when got back to our room.


During our staycation, the hotel pool by Samba wasn’t finished so we ended up lounging at Kerry Sports’ outdoor lap pool, albeit it was quite noisy due to most surrounding buildings being under construction.

With over 8,000 square meters of space, Kerry Sports Manila is probably the largest indoor lifestyle club in the Philippines (or at least, we’ve been to). It has an indoor basketball court, tennis courts, squash courts, extensive gym facilities with state-of-art fitness equipment, exercise studios for yoga, Pilates, dance, spinning, kickboxing and mixed martial arts, a wellness spa, a sauna, steam room, and a cold plunge pool.

All in all, our staycation was fantastic. This property lives up to the Shangri-La reputation by excelling in everything from location, food, ambience, quality, and service. Can’t wait for our next staycation!

Cheers!

"After a few successive unpleasant experiences with Shangri-la in recent years, I was giving up on them. However on this trip, I had no choice, as the conference I was attending was held at this hotel, and also it was just two blocks away from our office in the Philippines. My Shangri-la Golden Circle membership therefore got revived as a result.

It turned out to be a different experience from my recent experiences. On the whole, the stay was drama-free – no mistakes with bookings, no errors in the billing, no mixing up of room assignments etc. It had been awhile since the last time my Shangri-la stay went all according to plan, so it was a refreshing change, especially when I had got accustomed to expecting the worst with this brand.

The hotel is relatively new, and most things are therefore clean and in good working order. The room is of a reasonably good size and functionally, most things are well-designed and layouts and placements generally made good sense. As a bonus, I got a room with a pretty good view.

Service was also good in general. Most of the staff members were helpful and polite. Unlike a few other hotels I have stayed at in this city, the people here are also not pushy when it comes to tips. The friendly staff certainly helped to make the stay more pleasant.

The part I like most about this hotel has got to be the gym. It has one of the best hotel gyms I have seen so far, and felt almost like one of the commercial gyms. I ended up going to the gym quite abit in the evenings after work.

It has been quite some time since I last said this of a Shangri-la property, but the next time I need to be here on business again, I will likely choose to stay at this hotel again.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"It was our first visit to the Shangri-La at the Fort. It is in a great location and we're lucky enough to have stayed in a Premier Suite. The hotel facilities were second to none with access to the club floor. Highly recommended.

However when we checked in after arriving from Australia at 8.00pm, our room wasn't ready and had to wait close to an hour while it was being cleaned. It wasn't the best start.

We were close to High St and all the other Fort shopping centres and restaurants.",Location
"We checked in at the tail-end of a busy week, and we had to wait 2 hrs to get a room. At first, we were informed to wait 30 min, so we went out for an hour to eat, came back, only to be informed that the room wasnt available yet. But through all this the staff were very helpful and apologetic, assisting us with our luggage, allowing our kids to swim and use the changing room, taking the room key to us when it was available. Thank you to Anton at reception. And throughout our stay, the staff were all helpful and kind. The room and facilities were top notch and the location was wonderful. Its a great place for a staycation with kids. My kids enjoyed the pool area and basketball facilities, and going to the mind museum, which was just beside the hotel. The lifeguards, pool people and changing room attendants were very attentive. The deluxe room was spacious and comfy for a family to stay in.
I would just like to suggest two things to management: I hope that when there are several days of high occupancy, the check out time can be managed properly so that the waiting time for check in wont be so long. Also, there wasnt any place for my kids to sit while waiting. I hope that they would allow the lounge beside the lobby to be a waiting area when there are plenty of customers waiting.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"First of all Fort Bonafacia is a real success, grid built city, close to the airport with amazing, if not american themed, services such as restaurants and galleries. The Shang is fantastic, rooms are perfect, not over the top functional and relaxing for business travel. The Burger/Steak restaurant in the hotel is 1st class also. Well done!",Location:Food:Staff
"This is a new hotel opened less than a year in a relatively new district. Hotel room has good size and modern decor, service is quite good. Restaurant choice in hotel is okay but not as much as expected from Shang, however the steak house is actually pretty good. High street with a lots of good shopping and restaurants are just next door.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This hotel, although technically ""new"", is amazing. The staff are exceptional. This is my preferred stay while in Manila on business. The restaurants offer variety and great fare and the pool area is gorgeous as is the massive gym that includes various classes every day. The best hotel in the BGC.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
