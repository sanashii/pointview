"Great family vacation at Shangrila Mactan,We travelled with our 7 year old son and stayed for 2 nights. It was our 2nd time to visit the resort but our first time with our son. I was happy to see they had the kiddie splash zone, the adventure zone, timezone. We also observed that t here were new corals planted in the cove which explains why we saw a lot more species of fish this time. We stayed in the main wing and had a room facing the ocean. Our room and facilities were kept spotless. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet a lot and we got to try the Italian restaurant, Dimsum restaurant, as well as the burgers at the bar by the pool. We didn't have to leave the resort to find good food. We would gladly visit again in the future.",Food:Location
"Jet setter,My first time at Shangri-la then we booked in J park and Blue water ,Maribago also. I will definitely will come back to Shangri-La.",Location:Staff
"Musty Old place,It's an old musty hotel that's in dire need of a revamp. The beach is filled with sharp rocks and requires a life vest during high tide even if you're just a few feet away from the shoreline! They have an exclusive pool for some patrons in a certain block which is discriminating at this day and age-- dinner was decent but it came with a high price.. P2,500 per person to be exact. Overall, it's a good one-time experience kind of a resort. Nothing spectacular.",Value for money
"It’s a great place for family with young children.,Hotel offers babysitting services that allows my husband and I get a massage, and they have free playground for toddlers.",Staff
"Exceptional,Loved every minute of our stay here. Our 2 young boys loved the children’s pool and water slides and feeding the fish was a big highlight. The staff were so friendly and helpful from the moment we arrived to the minute we left,as a family this resort had everything we were looking for and we cannot wait to return.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Unbelievable,Words cannot describe how amazing this place is. From the environment to the staff, to the restaurants to the service, it is all that you would want from a 5 star resort. Well worth the money spent. Do not settle for second best, just go for the best.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"Incredibly overpriced for what you get.,It’s a very nice hotel, staff are wonderful, and location is ok, with the exception of a tiny beach area. The issue I had was the cost of the food. Considering that excellent Filipino food can be had anywhere around, the price for a buffet was outrageous. Between that and taxes I ended up paying almost double my room rate for what I consider to be less of a resort and more of a very nice hotel.",Value for money:Food:Location
"Exceptional,Friendly staff, great facilities, love the pastry/ bakery from buffet breakfast & awesome sea view! Definitely value for money....",Food:Value for money
"Overrated,Never prefer Shangrila over other hotel chains. But it was the only 5 star hotel in the area, so we gave it a try. It was a disappointment as expected. We booked a room with sea view, and were given one far from it. Totally not worth it, and it costed USD 350. Suitable for family I guess but not good enough for couples for this price.",Value for money

"The best stay ever!,I love every minute of my time spent at Shangri-La Mactan because the place is super clean, quiet and the environment is so relaxing just like i needed for a break from busy city of Kuala Lumpur. The staff are amazing and the food are awesome too. Highly recommended for a quick weekend gateway. You’ll enjoy every minute of it just how i did!",Location:Food:Staff
"I’d love to go back soon!,Although Shangri-La’s Mactan Resort and Spa is huge, the staff made you feel like you were cared for as an individual. There was just a period when it was hard to get poolside service, but the service at all other times was stellar. I loved the blending of indoor and outdoor spaces, which contributed a lot to the tropical resort feels. There’s quite enough space on the property that it didn’t feel crowded even though the hotel was fully booked during our stay. We stayed for two nights and that wasn’t enough time to use all of the amenities. It probably did not help that the room was so restful that you really didn’t want to leave it.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"It’s my 4th visit,I’ve been there 4x in the last 5years. The location is perfect since you avoid the city traffic going to the resort. It only takes around 15-20mins coming from airport. Service and food is as expected from a big name hotel chain. In terms of facilities, 90% are still the same from my first visit. I think they need to add new things to see/do... On my recent visit, I tried to request for an early check-in. Reasonably, they werent able to give it since the hotel was fully booked. However, what I didnt like is that my room wasn’t ready until 3PM (an hour after the posted check in time). Hopefully, it will be a better visit next time...",Staff:Location
"We had an amazing experience.,Every one of the staff members that we talked to were very friendly, helpful and nice. Excellent staff! The rooms were very clean and tidy. The food and the drinks in all of the restaurants were delicious. The buffet was always well presented and the food was very fresh and tasty. We were treated so well that my daughter and I felt like princesses. The sport trainers (Zumba, Paddling board, circuit training) were very professional and fun to work out with! We would definitely go back again!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Disappointing. Expected more given price.,Property is well situated. Conveniently located near airport. Beach access and sprawling property were the pluses. However, given room cost over $400+ per night we expected more. Hotel was full, buffet was crowded, water system under repair so we had brown water for a period of time, aircon needed repair, cockroaches, other issues.

"Good overall, but too expensive for this service,On the first day, the carpet on the floor was too itchy, so we asked for a carpet shampoo. Besides that, the room was clean and the view was amazing.

"Good faciities and private beach,This hotel is located a bit far from city área, but if you wish to stay relaxed I would recommend this clean, pleasant hotel with private beach with beautiful corals. There is only one restaurant nearby (which is Spanish), no souvenir shop nor shopping mall within walking distaice. Hotel staff are all nice and greet pleasant. There are some free activities like hotel garden tour, snorkelling camp, etc available. We went to an excursion for snorkelling, and enjoyed it at deeper sea than private beach. However, beauty of corals is just as good as hotel's private beach. It is great that the hotel maintains so beautiful there.",Location:Food

"Aileen from London,The resort and its rooms are beautifully designed and landscaped. It is spacious althroughout. There are massive pools surrounded by an enormous garden that’s been taken care of so well. Although old furniture and corridor carpet could be improved. Staff in the kitchen/restaurant and reception/check-in desk were so helpful, accomodating and polite. Varieties of excellent food but not too many choices for allergy children (dairy and nuts allergy). The beach is nice but not for small children. Other services which demand staff were slightly slow and there’s a bit of waiting time. It's most likely due to the size of the resort and the large number of clients. Taxi’s availability isn’t so great and sometimes there’s a queue. Overall it is a nice resort with great facilities and amenities, however it is quite pricey.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

We were made to queue when we were checking out at 12 noon, and the lobby was hot (no air conditioning). We had to call the attention of the supervisor to do something about the long line especially since there was no airconditioning and it was hot.

Only cons were the Buko Bar ran out of sweet potato fries during our stay, and the bathroom close to the game room was quite dirty. There was an unpleasant odor and the trash cans were overflowing. Other than that, we had a great stay - avoided that bathroom for the rest of our vacation. I gave cleanliness 4 stars still since the rest of the resort and its facilities were up to par. Food was also easily available within the resort, but they can be pricey. The Chinese restaurant particularly was average and not worth the price you're paying. If you have the time and wouldn't mind taking a cab, would recommend eating outside as there are better options and at more reasonable prices.

The steam room in the gym is one of the best i have wver stepped into. The gym staff anticipates your every need. Our room had a balcony and a separate sun deck overlooking the property and ocean. My only concern is the food is not at 5 star level. In fact its just ok. We ordered butter chicken which was beyond overcooked. In the dining room we ordered calimari which had breading consistent with frozen sefood dinners. But would i go back? YES",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"Checked off the box for Cebu Mactan,This was the third Shangrla we have stayed in. The other two were in Manila and Chang Mai. First I want to point out that this property is 100% oriented towards couples and families. There is almost nothing of interest at the hotel or the surrounding area for those that come alone. Great free guided snorkeling tour and fair priced jet skis and other water toys. Staff was very nice, efficient and helpful at all times. Especially those working the beach. Security was very tight. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Lunch and dinner were lousy. I believe they have six restaurants all together. Cayree's cove has a very relaxing atmosphere. How they could screw up seafood is beyond me.The one and only alternative to the hotel for dinner is to exit the hotel grounds and walk directly across the street. Hola Espanol was excellent and fair priced. We ate there three out of the four nights of our stay. The rooms are clean and as others have mentioned old and tired. Balcony/sunset views good. $$$$$$$",Food:Location:Staff

This hotel has its 5 stars very well achieved, although it is expensive among other options the experience was really worthed.

"Tiny beach, overpriced everything, invasive ""security"" to keep out locals, poor food, bad experience,I rarely spend the time to review hotels, but this was the worst ""resort"" hotel experience I have had, especially relative to it's ""5-star"" rating. To get into the resort you need to pass thru ""security"" who scans thru the taxis to make sure you're not smuggling in guns or contraband; ridiculous. I believe the real reason for security is to give the illusion that the place is sp coal and that guests shouldn't leave the resort. This in turn allows the resort to charge outlandish prices for basic items. For example, hotel massage for $120 usd/hour (versus a much better massages at $12/hour literally right across the street). $8 Evian water in room versus $1.25 at the 7-eleven down the street. We found the security offensive, the prices offensive, and the facilities mediocre.

Very poor experience!!",Value for money:Staff:Food

Can you imagine indulging an Austrian Linzer Schnitte in the land of Fun, tasting almost same as in my home country? The excellent wine selection, perfect Vienna Melange @ Club floor and the acquaintance OF OTHER internationnal guest made every evening a great experience. Even the restaurant staff always found a way to meet and exceed our expectations.

I have never experienced such a classy ambiance and professional service in whole Asia before.

The food is very overpriced. Buy one get free happy hour is a joke. Cocktails are 400 pesos each. Elsewhere the max I've seen is 180. There is the option of going to Ayala for cheaper dining and shopping, but what's the point of doing that and spending money on a resort you aren't present in.

So if you intend to stay longer, might be a good idea to buy some stuff before coming in. We didn't go out except to the Spanish restaurant just outside.

Noe in the front security was very courteous who made our easy access to the transportation... The Cowrie fine dining was awesome overlooking by the ocean, the buko bar, the breeze bar, the main lobby at night is perfect for some drinks while listening to the music..The only thing I was shocked was the taxes they have the VAT, BEVERAGE TAX, FOOD TAX and understandle 10% Gratuity is already added so don't be surprised for a lot of charges added to your orders/bills.

If you don't reserve one early in the morning you have no chance. We had the a OceanClub room, very friendly (but not enough) staff. One of the poorest Clubroom experiences so far. completely overbooked, sometimes hardly find a place. Extremely small snack selection. Afternoon only (very sweet) cake, peanuts and crackers. No sandwich or something similar. Maybe we were spoiled by the club at the Sofitel Plaza in Manila, which were wirliche 5 Stars. This one deserves more than 4 stars. The staff are, however, put a lot effort to make the stay at the club a bit more enjoyable. But here is probably very saved by management. Even beer is only available from 5pm to 7pm. The selection at cocktail time is very small, 3 to 4 snacks, but mostly fried. The best is still the sushi, but here are only 4 pieces rausgestellt (for up to 50 guests in the club).

"Had to cut short the holiday...,The beach, the kids pool area, the breakfast.,The first room they gave us was a bit ratty and overlooking the garden and above the air-conditioning plant making a full on noise 24/7. I had to get it changed but noticed many rooms were in this position. Luckily they found a much nicer and bigger renovated room, with seas views, which was supposedly the same standard... The resort itself was really nice with big grounds and lots of indoor and outdoor play areas for kids. Not to mention a beautiful private beach. The breakfast was fantastic, although it's the second time I have stayed in this resort and on both occasions the fresh mangoes were sour, which is not what you expect when you visit Cebu.. The buffet dinner was probably good if your Asian, but if you're a westerner you may not find much joy, at least I didn't. After that it was a steak sandwich off the menu. My 2 year old son was not eating properly, since his mom was not preparing his meals. The staff at breakfast were truly fantastic and helpful, and really the best part of the trip. They cooked special food for him as per moms directions and it did help a lot, although it could not see us through the whole day, so it got to be a problem. This was followed by a cough developing and the need to keep him away from the water slide, which would prove difficult, so we ended up having to leave 3 days early. Sadly, no refund but I guess that's the way it is.....",Food:Staff:Location

"Just WOW!,Restaurant choices, activities, service,Just wow is all we can say. We stayed for 4 days with my in-laws. Talk about spoiled for choice for food .. if you wanted, you don't need to leave the resort. Seafood, grill, you name it. Attended the Filipino Cultural show and BBQ. Amazing (happens a few times per week). My days usually consisted of a short morning swim in the ocean (you're basically on the beach), buffet breakfast (never could have enough omelets), laze around the pool or beach until lunch, big lunch at one of the restaurants, a nap followed by dinner, then drinks at the bar listening to live music. If you need to get away, there are hourly shuttles to the major shopping areas of Cebu. We had seniors with us so this made sense, otherwise we would have just taken a taxi. I think the best way to sell this place is the following, it's big enough that you and your partner/travel companion(s)/group can never run out of things to do together .. which is big enough to keep everyone busy that you don't need to see them all day.

"Noisy and overcrowded hotel,We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights at the mainwing and booked via Agoda for its 5-star rated and its brand name. Unfortunately we just couldn't sleep well each night because of the noise from the hallway. The room door was not sound-proof; we could hear all noises coming from every room door opening/closing, people talking while walking along the hallway randomly that woke us up throughout the night, and also in the morning. We complained to the hotel, and were given an ""upgrade"" room, so to speak at the oceanwing, and it was slightly improved. When checking out the lady at the front-desk asked if we were happy with our stay, and we told her about the noise and she was politely suggesting in our next trip we should book a suite or high-graded room. I believe she missed the point which is a 5-star hotel should at least be able to provide the basic need to customers, i.e. quiet room for guests to sleep well. Upgraded room is only the extension of degree of luxuary and comfort. For the breakfast area was a nightmare for people like us as couples wanted to relax in this so called"" resort&spa"". There were hundreds of room guests filled up the resturant and many were to queue up for table. On Sunday morning, hotel even had to open the adjcent Chinese resturant to accomodate some guests to sit after picking up the food from the main cafe. I surely believe this hotel has been operated for so many years in business and still don't know when is the peak season and how to divert guests into different areas for breakfast and dinning? Can they extend the breakfast time to 11:00 instead of 10:30, so density of guests would not be so focused in the last hour? I am sure we are not the only one complaining this noisy and overcrowded issues. Hotel management should be addressing these matters on their top piroity...If this is ""resort $ spa"" hotel, then it was my mistake.

I just wish that all guests regardless of color will be given equal treatment. Reception needs more training in handling guest requests and wish to be consistent on their policies.",Staff:Food

"Great resort in Mactan!,Amenities, Food outlets, ambience,We stayed at Shangrila's Mactan Resort and Spa and we enjoyed our stay. The resort is just a 15-minute ride from the airport. The resort's lobby is so grand and imposing even though there were a lot of people checking in when we arrived. We had our prenup shoot in the resort as well which made us appreciate more the resort. As it is, the resort is a destination by itself. Their pools are so inviting and their beach, stunning. Our room's large but we had to request bedroom slippers as we did not find any. One sad thing though, they failed to greet my fiancee on her birthday last June 1. It was quite unexpected for a resort which is known in the hospitality industry for its service deluxe to forget something like this. The front desk supervisor even asked for the birthday of my fiancee (my room companion) which I registered when we checked-in.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"pleasant experience with my family at Shangri-la ,pool facilities, rooms,,Disappointed when checking out as they had problems with my debit card. It was as if they intentionally had their facility offline so I could pay in cash.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Great service... Overpriced and under valued food!,Staff, pool and beach,Whilst the staff and accomodation was good the food experience really hurt our overall resort experience. We were especially disapointed in the Cowrie Cove... great ambiance and spectacular setting but the food was terrible and way overpriced. I expected the Shangri La cebu to be an expensive experience which is fine, but I do expect to get some value for the added cost and the food at this resort missed that mark is a huge way!!",Value for money:Food:Staff

"Mactan Resort and Spa,Efficient and friendly staff, excellent choice of dining and cleanliness of all areas,My stay at the resort was fine, except for the problem on check in. The hotel had no record of my booking with Agoda and they were fully booked. I am awaiting the results of Agoda's investigation into this matter. I would not recommend the hotel for a solo traveller. It was definitely family orientated and appeared to be a first choice for newly weds and young couples. This is not a criticism of the hotel, rather more research on my part would have changed my choice. The resort was kept immaculately and everything that a family or a couple could wish for - but not a solo travelller.",Staff:Food

"Great food and snorkeling ,I enjoyed the fact that snorkeling was so amazing right off the beach. Dining at any resto will be a wonderful experience. The hotel is quiet at night making every night relaxing.,The hotel is great for families but I was alone and I had an excellent time. The food was amazing. My fave is the Cowrie Cove and try any fresh fish on the menu. The hotel staff are very friendly and attend to any need no matter if by pool or on beach. The Shang still has the best service no matter where they are located.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"shangri-la two thumbs up! Five stars!!!,The amenities, food and staff!,The three best things about shangri-la are first the value of your money is worth it! This hotel is very costly but the hotel, the room, the amenities the staff are excellent!!!!!! Second the food is very delicious! Tried tea of spring and its very delicious!!!!!i love their food! Third, the room is very spacious and cozy!!! The staff are very friendly and accomodating. They gave us free extra bed because we have a child that will use it. Though we requested for a pool view but it wasn't granted. But its okay. The swimming pools were very nice and kid friendly. There were lifeguards everywhere. Very very safe.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
