"Good,We checked in for the 3rd year straight for my sons birthday. The last 2 years i informed them it was my son birthday and they sent up a cake as a small token for my son to enjoy. This time around, i informed the receptionist upon check in we were there for my sons birthday and he said they send a little something to the room later on in the evening. They must've forgotten because when we arrived to the room the room had been cleaned but no cake or brownies. I called the reception to find out if they were still sending the cake over. They said, what for? I explained to them and had to call 4 different times when finally they sent up a cake at 11pm. The last 2 years we stayed the weekend there for our sons birthday it was already there when we walked in from dinner. This time they forgot. We've stayed at a couple Shangrila resorts and this is probably the first time we didn't feel very special. Last, i found a sock under the bench in the shower. It probably belonged to the guest that stayed in the room before us. The room wasn't as clean as it use to be either. My son loves Edsa Shangrila because of their kids slide and kiddie pool amenities but i'll probably need to insist on staying at the Shangrila at the Fort next year.",Staff:Food
"The staff doesn't seem to be welcoming and helpful. ,I like the room. The hotel itself is really nice. The staff, not so much. Service in the restaurant is not good, we went there for late lunch last 27th of October if Im not mistaken and the service is horrible. Food is not well prepared either. Bean sprouts weren't cleaned and our lamb was well done when it's supposed to be medium rare. Bread is cold and No ketchup for fries. The front desk staff wasn't nice when we were extending our stay. Overall, not so good for me. Hopefully the hotel management is aware about this.",Staff:Food
"Above average,For you to send me your rates when asked for an early check-in is so NOT a 5 star hotel trait. Where is the hospitality??? I know we all look for upsell options but what you doing for early check in is cheap- it would make more sense to ask for the check in time rather than just sending your tariff. Your rooms are very very ordinary with new entrants like Okada etc in the market. You got some catching up to do. Also you can learn from Solaire/Okada on how to make things special for guests who come to celebrate in your hotel. Disappointed.",Staff:Value for money
"Crazy security style. People cant walk thru the car exit way. You have to walk like you are driving,I believe final security check in when entering hotel but if you are walking, you have to enter thru car entry entrance instead of short cut from car exit, entry point which is more convenient if you walk from megamall. They force you to walk around with no sidewalk and no covered path. That kind of service with almost 10000 pesos a night",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"In case you missed it..,We stayed here for my sister’s wedding last weekend. In the middle of a video/photo shoot, there was some water leakage from the ceiling. They had to improvised and put a waste basket in the middle of the room just to keep the water off the floor. Edsa Shangri-la, you are not helping!!! We were behind schedule as it is so we had to be extra cautious to prevent any liquid staining the wedding gown. It probably didn’t helped that the weather was blazing hot but the AC in the rooms and facilities (ballrooms) were not working properly. But we were still hoping it would somehow improve. AC was not cool enough (we set it up at the coolest temperature) for all rooms due to ongoing repairs happening in the hotel and they said they would cranked up the AC around 3 am. By the time we came back from Church, we decided to get something from our room – only to find out that our room was flooded from the damaged water line. Apparently, this has been going on for 30 minutes while we were at Church. May I just point out if you were a part of a wedding entourage this is such a waste of time and hassle. Boo Edsa Shangri-la! We couldn’t get inside but luckily our things were spared from the water. Staff had to get our things inside the safe and they had to transfer all of our things to another room. Sad thing was we didn’t get to take any family pictures because I was busy staring at our room filled with water. Management could have done a lot more improvement. I asked around and heard that this was also the same problem last week. Leaking ceiling and broken AC. Based from my experience, this is not a 5-star hotel given the current services and facilities.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Use to be a great hotel,The hotel itself is actually very nice. Rooms are a little dated, but is kept clean. Pillows and bed are all very comfortable. What was disappointing was the staff. When you arrive there is NO ONE to help you with your bags. For the past 2 visits I had to bring my own bags in. Put them into the x ray and lug them to the counter. For some reason the arrival area is just not managed. Checking in can take some time. But once you get through all of that it's a pretty good hotel. Compared to some of the hotels in Makati this one was pretty good value for your money. Just don't expect too much in terms of service. And the food...... very very bad. If you want a comfortable place to just sleep in. Its good and the gym and pool areas are great.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

When you book here make sure you tell the front desk that you will demand to be transfered when you get a stinky room. The first room that was given to us smelled like old and humid. Like dirty clothes left in the bin for long. The showerhead has mildew and the spare blanket smells bad too.

"Disappointing,I am the daughter. My parents celebrated their anniversary spending 2 days and 1 night at EDSA Shangri-La. I was the one who personally chose this hotel because I'm very confident that being one of the well know hotels in the country surely my parents will be taken cared off. But to my disappointment, NO. Me and my sister was already coordinating the said booking right after it was booked in Agoda. Everything was running smoothly and even car service was arranged. We went to EDSA Shangri-La to settle the booking and to our surprise, they told us that there was no booking. Talks here and there until after two to three hours finally they were able to traced the booking. The question is, how on earth we were able to coordinate with this establishment so smoothly thru email and have encountered problems when we went there personally. At the time of checking-in, again problem arises. No confirmed car service well in fact from day number one it was there in the booking, fully paid. There was no hair dryer in the room. At the time of check-out still the receptionist was asking for the payment of the car service, well in fact it is paid already. They have given so much hustles to my parents considering that everything was properly coordinated and paid even before the time of checking in. Such a big disappointment.",Staff:Value for money
"Very far from a 5 star hotel, very disappointing,Parking is a pain. Check-in took an hour! Room carpet is very dirty. Mini bar is empty.

"Weekend Escape?,I am sorry, I didn't get the name of the person who checked us in, but he was wonderful. He told us about an upgrade that was available at a discounted price. This was well worth it. When he saw it was my daughter's birthday, he arranged to have a birthday treat sent to the room. While the interior of the room was great, the carpets leading to the suite need replacement:( Dinner at Senju was lovely. But, while I understand it was a Friday night, service at the Lobby Lounge could seriously stand improvement. We tried for half an hour to catch the attention of one of the service crew, but they were otherwise pre-occupied. In the end, my husband had to stand up and go to the bar just to get water for our daughter. Not something one would expect from a 5-star hotel and definitely not from a member of the Shangri-La chain.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

The club room is old the carpets are dirty, the bathroom has a bath shower which I can never understand why hotels put baths in rooms. No one ever uses them. The amenities are not up to shangri la standard. I am back to the sofitel.

"Way below 5 Stars! ,A single positive: upon check in I was upgraded to a suite, due to unavailability of my requested room. Sadly this was the only positive experience during my stay.,As a very frequent traveller I must say the experience during this hotel stay was probably my worst ever in a five star hotel in Asia: - When needed, I had to call Guest Services several times from my room. The phone usually rang 20-30 times before answered, if at all answered. - a call to Housekerping to make up my room was ignored. After a reminder call 40 minutes later, I was told they'd come to clean immediately ... A third call, some 20-25 minutes later was required to finally get the job done! - Room Service is slow and unreliable. Was told 30 mins delivery time and waited well over an hour! - I had to extend my hotel stay. Different rates were quoted by different staff. The final quote I received was in my view overpriced. After voicing my disagreement over the price, the quoted rate was immediately adjusted down. i guess less experienced travelers, who may not push back on 'outrageous' pricing, are simply overcharged. - mini bar wasn't re-restocked daily. - the hotel interior is old, the sofa in the suite seems more for decoration as comfortable seating is a challenge. - I had one dinner at Paparazzi, one of the hotel's restaurants, which was disappointing re food quality. The ordered starter wasn't fresh and had to be returned. Service quality in the restaurant is below par. - upon departure I ordered a hotel limo to get me to the airport. The car showed up 10 minutes late. - Lastly, the hotel security is clearly a farce! The focus seems to be on selected people only and is not done professionally at all. While I observed mainly local people being checked (if the performed action can be called a security check), I walked through 'security' twice with large paperbags (containing things I bought outside the hotel) without any checks being performed. I confronted the respective 'security' staff about such lack of diligence, but all I got back was embarrassed smiles. Would I recommend Edsa Shangri-La? Well, you make up your own mind ...",Staff:Value for money:Food

However, I was not told that this was per night a did not include a significant VAT tax and service tax which was meant that I face an unexpectedly larger bill than expected. Such taxes are not familiar to foreign travellers. One should be provided with a breakdown of costs or full disclosure of total costs upfront before being asked to sign at checkout.

"Most overpriced hotel hotel we stayed at,Clean, comfortable room,The dinner buffet was advertised at 950p, but after all the service charges it came to about 5000p for 2 people. A bottle of water we thought was complimentary cost me $13. A burger, salad, and a couple drinks for lunch was $75. Everything was just decent quality, but very overpriced. The charges for everything seemed deceptive and dishonest. You only find out when you are presented the bill. We stayed at five different 5 star hotels on this trip. The Edsa Shangri-La Manila was by far the most disappointing hotel I have stayed in on this trip, or any I can remember in the past few years. I would have filed a complaint with the management if I thought it would do any good. I think the best thing is just to inform as many people as possible to avoid this hotel. I would highly recommend any of the Crimson hotels instead. The Edsa Shangri-La Manila is an overpriced ripoff that can't compete with hotels that cost a quarter as much...",Value for money:Food
"Comfortable, not at par as other Shangri la hotels,Centrally located, convenient, wide spread buffet,Generally good. But not at par with other Shangri la hotel. Check in was fast, but check out was slow. The renovated room doesn't look renovated. Amenities not complete - only one toothbrush for a booking of two person, no vanity kits like cotton, comb - unusual for a 5-star hotel, and for a Shangri hotel name. The complimentary cookies looks like it was just tossed on the table. No turn down service on our first night.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Inconvenient. Renovated, but small rooms.,The hotel is located in a terrible place for doing business. The EDSA is a traffic disaster, and it is the only way to access. There are no restaurants nearby. While the food is decent (and expensive) at the hotel, there aren't any other choices around. Rooms are small, but were updated.

"Not worth the price, staff not approachaeble,Close to shopping malls, close to airport, luxurious,I would not recommend this hotel to my family and friends because staff only prioritize foreigners and not their own. My sister studied Tourism and Management here at United Kingdom and she was the one who stayed at the hotel with my family and she knows quite a lot about hotels. She did not receive a great service she thought she would expect in a five-star hotel! I payed for an extra bed and they got a sofa bed. Staff said all the rooms are fully-booked (which we did not believe at all) and they could not guarantee a room transfer but my sister complained and finally transferred into another room. Staff does not smile at all, and this is very disturbing particularly when they are the face of a luxurious hotel. I had booked for the room and nothing else, but staff expected them to have their meals at the restaurant as my family bought food outside the hotel and brought it at the hotel. Finally, my sister had to check out early due to her flight back to the UK and asked the reception to call for a taxi but they had waited 20 minutes for the taxi. This is not acceptable. We would definitely not recommend this hotel especially to my fellow Filipinos because they only prioritize foreigners.",Staff

"Upper End Luxury Hotel & Extra Services,Breakfast Place & Wifi availability,Everything is what I expected exclusively floor area for socializing & just be ourselves. A place tranquil for relaxation & chilling. One small glitch was my request for airport transfer, The reception assured me during my check in that the transportation the day I leave is arrange. I even ask what will be the best time to proceed to the airport early enough for the traffic in the city is is rampant at these times. Even the price for then car was set too...however the day I leave, found out that the transportation was not arrange & traffic to the city is terrible. To add the car was change to van, additional cost incurred. And was not available for there was no prior request as I did....almost miss that window to be one time for check in. Good thing the driver was from AVIS was sooooo, creative that we made on time the airport at the nick of time. Lesson, double check if your request was process...",Staff:Location

The service was very poor too.",Staff:Location:Food

Paid for a not so good view... even booked in advance. but overall hotel was okay.",Staff:Location
"Great Hotel,Horizon facilities very convenient for business traveller with ad-hoc meeting and networking requirements,hotel very comfortable and horizon facilites most convenient for the business traveller. the opportunity to hold short meetings and discussions on an ad-hoc/short notice basis provides welcome flexibility to travellers on a restricted schedule. as with any hotel in manila, it is important to consider the traffic when deciding upon a location, for anything within the business district of ortigas this hotel is very convenient.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Good hotel with nice features.,Had to rebook room 3 times to get the room originally requested.,The rooms are not all to same standard and the room had to be rebooked 3 times before I got the deluxe room requested. The hotel is very loud with lots of construction. It would be better to block off a section of the hotel and work on it than spread the construction across the entire structure.",Comfort & Facilities
"""Great staff ~ aging rooms"",The staff, atmosphere, food and facilities.,I was welcomed by friendly staff as I stepped out of the terminal, and a reception area of their own as a driver was located. It wasn't long til one was rounded up and the drive to the hotel began. After reaching our location, I was whisked up to my room without even visiting reception and able to rest straight away after the flight. Staying 3 nights, I was able to see a small part of the area, ordered in a few times whilst there but found the rooms a little dated for the price, and not up to the standard of other hotels around. The excessive charge for the limousine.. let down the experience somewhat, as it was only a Toyota (I've been in better taxi's) A comfortable stay all in all but I'd need to observe a fair face lift before thinking about staying once again.",Staff:Location:Food

"Wonderful Hotel,I loved the garden .. an oasis in the city,I was only in for a short weekend 'hop' but wanted ot be able to chill out and read a book to unwind. The beds are supurb as expected from this class of hotel, the garden and pool area one of the best in Manila, can lose yourself for a few hours and enjoy a home made hamburger... close to Singapore prices granted.. but delicious anyway.. gotta try it! The area can be a bit road heavy.. but i was lucky and had an F1 wannabe and got there in 20 minutes.. all the food was a bit pricy but all very nicely done .. you get what you pay for . no attractions nearby unless you accept the MegaMall an attraction.. and it is Mega! Anyway Agoda offer good room deals on this hotel often ... so as long as you grab a bargian it is worth it .. Manilla is a dusty grimy city and this place lets you lose that for a while .. all good..",Food:Location:Value for money
"One of the nest hotels in Manila,Great hotel with excellent service,this is a wondeful hotel in the esda district of manilla. getting there can be a problem at times because of the traffic but there are a number of malls in walking distance of the hotel. great rooms and great food. the bit i dont like is the so called security. mean with shotguns, who clearly have had limited training (yes i am ex military and spent some time in northern ireland) quite frankly the security screening is a joke. if you feel it is necessary do it properly!",Location:Staff

"A nice hotel, but showing its age.,Great pool area and a good buffet.,We spent the weekend at the hotel to relax for a weekend prior to returning home. The pool area was a welcome respite from the heat of Manila and the buffet at the restaurant was good as we expected at a Shangri-la. There were only two drawbacks with respect to our trip: 1. It is very difficult to obtain a metered taxi at this location. We waited at least 30 minutes each time we requested a taxi. I had dinner once at the hotel in the past and experienced the same problem. 2. The room although clean was worn for a 5 star hotel. I actually would of described it closer to a 3.5 to 4 star hotel room, with an old but functioning television, an old and tired telephone at least 10 years old, the furniture was tired etc. (get the picture).",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"next to good shopping mall ,connected to shopping mall,excellent and efficient check in easier to access shopping mall from the outside rather than use the rather meandering and longer way through the hotel . there is alot of construction outside so not a very attractive surronding at least now in february 2012. two shopping malls - shang and mega mall within walking distance allow much more variety in restaurants than offered at the hotel and the prices are much cheaper in the shopping mall by at least 50-100% - shangrila is far too expensive given the location away from makati",Location
"5 Star Hotel but...,Ambiance,Amazing Location and great 5 star ambiance.I was staying at the Hotel for convience to the particular location in Manila. I enjoy 5 star Hotels when I am pampering myself after long travel or rigerous work. So all of the details one expects make the heafty price tag worth it in a true five star hotel. This location I was comparing to the Sofitel 5 Star in Manila. I stay at Sofitel around the world. They are amazing and never miss a point. Shang was great but they missed the exceptional personal service we grow accustom to at 5 star Hotels. I arrived early to the Hotel and I was accomodated with an early check in. ( Very Nice ). My guest arrived at 7pm and I was meeting her in the lobby lounge. She walked in , not knowing the layout of the hotel. She was never greeted or asked if she could be helped. Although there were many staff at front lobby. They just looked right past her. She stood several minutes waiting to be helped.Finally I rescued her and brought her over myself. The Lobby was not particularly busy. That impression and lack of hospitality hurt the experience. I wont go thrugh every detail of the stay, but first impressions last. The pool bar was attended but the staff never offered service or approached our lounge chairs for a drink or food. I even waived them over and they just kept talking. Finally I got up and went over to order. They seemed very uninterested and very bored. I think the pool bar and hospitality manager needs to have some follow up training there. I am not demanding , but when you pay 10$ USD for a drink some service should come with the price tag. Our meals at the buffet were great! The service good and the food great. The price ok for the experience. The Hotel is beautiful and lavish. Very nice. The live music was great , a string quartet. In closing , we just didnt see the crisp attentive personal service we see at Sofitel. I am sure this can be fixed with a renewed and invigorating Hospitality BOOTCAMP. Best of Luck!",Staff:Food:Value for money

"Service slipping due to too many people,Great location & rooms,Sometimes being a well known, popular hotel.can have its disadvantages. Such is the case with this hotel - it is too crowded! Several examples of what we experienced will clearly support this point. In order to get a Taxi. the Concierge advised us to walk next door to the Mall since the main entrance to the hotel was very busy. Additionally, our room was on the 15th floor and the waiting time for an elevator, in either direction, was ridiculously long. On one day of our stay, an elevator was stopping at every floor and it took until noon to fix (only because a guest notified the staff of the problem despite the fact that there is an Elevator Girl at the Lobby level). Rooms are still very nice and the Staff courteous but the overcrowding issue negates these positive attributes.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"not impressed at all. very snotty.,the bed and the pillows,lets put it this way...i expected a 5 star hotel, where i can relax, get pampered. pricey, understand that, but...you should get your moneys worth. i did not. 1. staff showed preferences. make sure you are dressed well if not you will be looked down at. 2. i literally had to ask for services which is supposed to be a given for such an expensive accomodation. 3. after spending more than 5 days in that hotel, i felt cheated. it was a feeling of regret, as i know i would be treated better in a lesser star hotel.",Value for money:Staff
