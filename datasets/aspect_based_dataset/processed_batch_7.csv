"We stayed here for our honeymoon after reading so many positive reviews, and it definitely did not disappoint. The whole experience was absolutely amazing. The room was lovely, the food was delicious, the staff were all so lovely and the grounds of the resort were just beautiful. We spent every day either at the pool, beach or spa and had the most relaxing time. We also noticed how well they catered for families and we would recommend this place for couples and families alike. We will definitely be going back.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I've stayed here thrice and every stay was really a great experience. Whenever I book during peak season, like Christmas Season, if I'm on waitlist, front desk would always find their way to accomodate and allot a room for me. All the hotel staff are very warm and friendly, you'll actually feel the Cebuano hospitality when you stay in this resort... Food on all their restaurants are great and worth the price. Love their wide and diverse selection of food especially breakfast. It has a wide, white sand beach with ample day beds. They also have watersports like kayaking and jetski. It has 3 swimming pools, gym, spa and activity center. Rooms are very spacious, comparable to 5-star hotels. An overnight stay is not enough to enjoy all its amenities. Not other resort in Mactan can compare to Sahngrila. World-class indeed!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"just read the other reviews, nothing more to add, just go there experience and enjoy. It will be an annual pilgrimage from here on. Special mention to ambassador Guia and Ruel at fitness gym and of course to all the staff - keep the 5 stars shinning !",Staff:Food
"I enjoyed my weekend stay. All areas of the resort were amazing. The staff and employees were very friendly and accommodating. They were always ready to grant your requests and needs. The swimming pools were always clean. There were many activities you can do inside the resort. Everything could be done inside. The prices of the foods were a bit pricey though. Overall, it was a great experience. It was nice to stay again in this hotel.",Staff:Food
"Was here for a conference, 6 days in total and have to say was a great stay. The facilities, particularly the pools and beach are excellent while the staff were simply so friendly and helpful. Food was good too, with a wide choice of restaurants. While didn't have the family here, I am sure that they would have had a great time. Plenty for kids to do, with good water slides and childrens pool.

Room, particularly the bathroom was a little outdated. The Ocean wing or club wing is very good and by staying there you can have breakfast at the ""more exclusive"" Aqua rathetr than the main buffet breakfast which was very crowded

First trip to Philippines and the Shangri-La, but will come back with the family next time.",Food:Location:Staff
"My boyfriend and I stayed here last December. Overall, it was a lovely stay but this place isn't really for couples who want a quiet getaway from the city. This resort is more for families.

PROS
- Clean and spacious rooms
- Wide selection in the breakfast buffet
- Cowry Cove is a beautiful area if you'd like to chill and have a few drinks in the evening
- Wide beach compared to other resorts in Mactan
- Lots of sunbathing areas
- The resort is huge so there are various activities and areas to explore

CONS
- We were able to check in an hour and a half after 2pm. We requested for late checkout and initially, they didn't want to give this to us. But eventually they allowed to checkout at 2pm when justified that we waited for quite some time to get to our room.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Me & my friend have been wishing for the last 10 years to stay here but just couldn't afford yet. Good thing we have availed of a promo rate and we got our mother to avail an additional senior citizen discount!!!! The hotel staff are so friendly and accommodating from the time I booked for our stay up to the day we arrive and left. Even the shuttle driver who brought us to and from the malls/resort. The place is just superbly beautiful, especially the landscaped gardens.

It was valentines season, and there were just too many guests. Business is really going great for Shangri-la!! Breakfast buffet is endless! munch-munch-munch...

"I spent 2013 Christmas holidays there as I heard bad rumor of typhoon HAYAN had affected and they had been suffering from decreasing the number of visitors. Our decision was right and we could enjoy the beautiful beach without bunch of visitors:)
On breakfast, you can enjoy many kinds of beautiful food from many countries.
Although we had a breakfast at the same restaurant 5 days in a row, we were never bored.

In addition, I want to mark Chi, Spa!
We took a full body massage course for couples for 4 hours. They led us to one villa which was completely only for us. The villa has a garden which is not big nor small. We soaked into the coconuts bath located in the garden which was no doubt heaven.

One downsides I could find was the cost of day-trip they provided was crazily high which was almost double. so you should make a day-trip booking outside of the Hotel.

But I am very sure that I will go back to the Hotel some day in the near future.",Food:Value for money:Location
"My wife and I just spent 4 days (20th Feb to 24th Feb 2014) at this fabulous resort, again we had a panorama suite with outstanding views on the seventh floor. This was our third visit and it seems to get better each time we visit. This was a celebration holiday as it was my wife's birthday, they gave her a small cake, some roses and balloons. We ate lunch and dinner at Tea of Spring, the Peking Duck was fabulous as was the yum cha lunch. We were
invited to The General Manager's Cocktail evening on our second night, here we met most of his management team and they are a wonderful group of people. We struck it up nicely with the Resident Manager Alex. We had dinner together with his charming wife, this was certainly an amazing evening. The next day we just took it easy with lunch and dinner at Acqua. A special mention must be given here to Chef Franco as he tailored our meals more to our liking. We had dinner again the last night with Alex at Acqua, and Alex being Italian as is Franco, naturally the food was superb. We enjoyed the Ocean Club lounge and here we were well looked after by either Gigi (Director of Rooms) or Veronica (Ocean Club Manager). Veronica is very sweet and looks after us beautifully again. I have to say that all the people at Shangri La Mactan are fabulous. BUT my special mention on this visit because of her service and dedication and wonderful service to us is Jennifer. Most certainly we will visit here again.",Staff:Food

"We stayed at this resort with three children.
The Panoramic Suite offered us plenty of room for all of us - two rooms, a separate bathroom and one large walk in closet.
The front room had a sofa bed and the hotel offered us a roll-away for free.
The third child slept in the walk in closet in the actual bedroom with the pillows from the sofa bed - super cozy and big enough for a little one.
Us parents had a generous king bed which was comfortable and large enough for comfort.
The view from our room was just like it said - panoramic. Absolutely beautiful and fully private.
The whole length of the suite had a private balcony with two chairs, a table and a drying rack.
The bathroom was large with a tub, shower, two sinks and a toilet behind a separate door.
Toiletries were added generously (L'Occitane) and towels were replaced twice or more each day.
The suite came with a beautiful coffee maker with single serve coffees and a variety of delicious teas.
We also received fresh fruit during our stay, including mango, apples and bananas.

With the Panoramic Suite comes free use of the two lounges on-site - one upstairs (which is more formal) and one downstairs (which has kids tv which is great for when the grownups are eating or just enjoying the moment). The lounges offer coffee, fresh drinks, small pastries, some cookies, peanuts and at night small warm bites and alcoholic beverages.

The cleaning staff was extremely courteous and changed our bedding every day.
They kept our privacy in account and always made sure not to inconvenience us.

The breakfast buffet was very large, with lots of items to choose from.
The fresh fruit, pastries, variety of bread, made to order eggs, asian cuisine, yoghurts, fresh fruit smoothies, local delicatessen, steamed sticky rice, cheese platters, baked potato and muesli and cereal made for a feast. Not to mention the made to order coffees. Yum.
The waiting staff was polite and always ready to help.
It was clear they were very well trained.

We bought the dinner buffet four times during our stay - absolutely delicious. Especially the desserts. Look for the chocolate brulee, the chocolate fountain or the variety of cakes. And try the crab legs, sushi, freshly cut salmon or tuna. Or the delicious Indian cuisine, creamy soups, pate or fresh fruit. All heavenly.

The resort grounds were peckless and so calming. The beaches clean, well equipped with beach chairs and fresh fruity water is offered to all guests who lounge there. The waters are pristine with beautiful snorkeling opportunities. No boogieboarding, for there are barely any waves to speak of. Snorkeling gear, canoes and jet skis as well as some other items can be rented or some of these things are sometimes included with the package that you choose.

Every night the resort offered a theme night with dinner, but the show could also be seen by bystanders or passing guests. Very fun to watch and listen to.

The kids place is super - slides, ball pits and little girls and boys crafts activities.
There is also an e-zone, were kids can play some arcade games or air hockey.

The resort did offer some fitness and other activity classes, but the choices were limited.
That I would say was the only downfall to this resort - apart from lounging, eating and snorkeling there really was not too much to do for grown-ups. Which was fine by me, but if you are looking for action and excitement then this resort is not for you. Although the resort did offer shuttle service to a nearby mall or two, were English movies are shown and a plethora of Western restaurants could be found. I guess for those who are looking for more action this could help a bit.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I will start by saying I don't like resorts but I'll make an exception for this one. Everything was taken care of in a professional way with a smile. Staff would anticipate our needs at all times. The lady at the bar in the reception area was most pleasant, well educated and knowledgable. It was most agreeable to talk with her.
A taxi driver who didn't have change was told off by the doorman when we had left.
The prices at bars and restaurants, although expensive compared to cost of life in the Philippines, was more than reasonable compared to similar resorts in other countries.
The pools were cleaned thoroughly every night.
The sea was full of different kinds of fish and my little daughter could snorkel easily not having to swim far. The staff at the gym and playground were equally nice as was the waiting staff at most restaurants (the Cove restaurant was a little bit below which is a shame since the place is beautiful).
We had a free massage at the Spa and they called to make sure we wouldn't miss the opportunity and also here we were taken extremely good care of.
All in all a great experience. Thanks!

"We were 3 Indian families and celebrated Christmas in Mactan Resort. We found the resort to be too relaxing and comfortable. The rooms were big and comfortable. The service also was good and staff well mannered and well behaved. The best part was the resort had Indian chef and we relished vegetarian Indian food. The food was better than what you can get in India. The beach was man made and made up of white sand. There were 2 pools, both of them very neat and clean.

The resort is expensive as all are but you move out and across the street you get enough food and beverages. The best part is that you will get lot of water games outside the resort (all in vicinity of 2 kms) and you can bargain for better prices. You have an actual submarine nearby which goes inside water to abt 40 mtrs.( Yellow Submarine) For those who like adventure, you have lot of things to do.",Location:Food

The hotel throughout was clean and all the equipment was in good shape. The food was tasty and varied - and Courie Cove was a wonderful place for evening drinks.

"My family stayed for two days at Shangrila Mactan, and it never disappoint, even for a single minute. From check in till we check out, lobby hosts Diane and Chantal took care of our needs. They pampered my little girls with their fave mango juice. Bob at the front desk gave detailed information of our stay, Mae of housekeeping regularly asks us if we need her help to sterilise the feeding bottles, Roderick and Menard were helpful as well...knowing that we have kids, the flow of drinking water did not stop.
Katherine, the in house nurse also was very helpful when my 3yo had a fever. The duty manager called to check on us as well!
Lastly, Guia and Jon Paul at the Tides Resto provided excellent service while we were dining with the kids. All of them were smiling, and have told us how Shangrila took care of them. With one telling us 'the owner loves the staff..'",Staff
"This is our second time staying at the Shangri-La and it didn't disappoint. They are excellent handling food allergies, preparing special meals for our daughter and the chef coming and speaking to you on your special needs.

We stayed for 4 nights in a seaview deluxe room with our 2 children which was large enough for us and had lots of kids channels to keep them happy.

The beach and snorkelling is amazing, better than any day trip you would do. Thousands of fish and feeding them each day is fun.

- snorkelling safari held daily and is free
- junior tennis coaching - special thanks to Edward who is a great coach and really improved my sons tennis game
- play centre for the kids

"I've stayed in Hilton and Plantation Bay before, they're okay but Shangri La surpassed them all! Shangri La is a bit pricey but your money is worth it! This hotel has a good customer-service, all the staffs were always have a happy smile in their faces serving you and attending your needs. They made you feel that you are important.

We stayed in the 8th floor, Room 8051, ocean wing with the view of the pool and beach. Nice room with a view, perfect to chill out during night time and early in the morning.

There's a problem in our room, a water leaking at the toilet bowl, we made complaints and they fixed it right away.

There's also a noise above our room around 11pm. i called the front desk, she said it's the roof deck, I don't know who's there but it stopped for awhile and the noise came back for an hour or 2 and went away. I hope there's no people partying above Room 8051.

Swimming in the beach and in their pool is very secure, many lifeguards assigned looking after your safety. Their amenities is well maintained and cleaned everyday.

The buffet breakfast selections at Tides were okay but it would be better if they can improve it by adding more selections like in Radisson Blu.

The beach is nice, perfect for snorkeling, lots of fishes and corals. Fish food is free. It's their Marine Sanctuary. Tips: better visit Shangri La on the summer or no typhoon to enjoy the beach more!

Shangri La's spa is one thing you should never miss when you stayed at Shangri La.

If you want to go to the city, they have a shuttle bus to/from SM and Ayala.

Overall, I will stay in this hotel again. Well-maintained, friendly resort staffs, nice landscape, beautiful scenery. Best place to unwind and to escape from the busy life in the city. Highly recommended if budget permits.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I booked a room reservation as a gift for my friend who just got married in Cebu thru their hotline. I clearly emphasized that it should be charged in my credit card and not to my friend who will be occupying the room. The representative was very helpful and reassured me everything will be charged to my credit card as long as I send the requirements via email for the payment authorization. I promptly complied with everything even weeks before the booked date but upon my friends check out she called me that they have to pay for the room since they didn't have my information. The manager on duty during that time didn't even have the courtesy to call me and inform me about the incident instead forced my friend to pay for the bilI since the reservation was under their name. i called the hotline again with why such incident happened when I gave pretty clear instructions that it should be charged to my credit card. The representative told me they sent the requirements to Cebu branch and they even have the dates in which they sent it. I was the one who paid for The price for the incompetency of the Cebu Branch office, they called me early in the morning here in Canada because of the difference in the time zone. I was talking to them at 4am for them just to tell me they don't have my information on file and I have to send another email for the authorization form. No apologies whatsoever.It was such a hassle in my part and an embarassment too because it was my gift for my friend and they had to go through that experience being held upon check out because someone didn't do their job right.

"This is my first night here, out of total 4 nights with the family. 3 children and 2 adults. If to be honest, we typically having all of our short breaks from the city in Phuket. You can't really get it wrong in Thailand, right? Thus when we've waken up and decided to book our vacation over CNY, surprise surprise, Phuket is fully booked.

The only option was then Cebu for us. Being in Cebu before I felt it is a compromise and that it can't compare to Thailand (we're typically staying in Marriott). Surprise, Surprise, this place is amazing.

What I like about the place? Service is amazing. Really amazing. In every corner there is someone to help, and to be a step ahead of you in offer help and service. Don't get me wrong, you can't feel all these staff around you. 2nd, despite the hotel being very large, it is also very spacious and open and thus you can't really feel the amount of guests here. Business travellers - hurray, the Wifi has full bars across all the hotel, even in the beach.

Children - great activities with really good clubs and equipment throughout the resort itself.
The sea- the water is crystal clear ,and you can snorkel 5-10 meters aways from the beach to see beautiful corals and fish.

We're staying all in one room, and it is not very spacious, but despite this we're enjoying ourselves.
Lastly, take into account that there's no much to do outside the hotel, thus focus on a stay of several days only. Shangri-la - this is my first time with you and certainly not the last.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I have been taking photos in Asia for over two weeks and wanted to find a very relaxing place with a nice view from the room decent Internet service and decent food. This is a resort that is very much family oriented, personally I was here alone and didn't take advantage of all of the outdoor activities it has to offer. What I did take advantage of was the clean air, the polite and timely staff, and the view from my room. This was a great place to sit back and post process 11,000 photos I have taken two previous weeks. The breakfast and dinner areas can get a little loud and busy with children during peak hours so if you want some quiet I recommend getting there early.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My family stayed at this hotel just after the new year, and given this is a Shangri-La we came away quite disappointed with our visit, although there were some highlights.

First and foremost, the best aspect of the resort is the amazing service and friendliness of the staff. From the very first moment we were greeted at the airport all the way through entire stay, we were constantly greeted with smiles, friendliness and offers to assist with anything we needed. I congratulate the hotel on this accomplishment as it is very difficult to do this consistently across all levels of a property so this was a highlight of our stay.

The other very positive piece of feedback is that overall, the resort’s amenities and activities are excellent, especially the marine reserve. The snorkelling was perhaps the best I have ever enjoyed off the beach of a resort, and the quality of marine life and the obvious effort that has gone into preserving the marine environment is to be applauded. I also appreciated having the beach, as although many on Trip Advisor have downplayed it as being artificial, I didn’t mind that whatsoever and to be frank could hardly tell in any case. In my mind, the key to a successful holiday at an island family resort is options: having both a beach and a pool, kid-focused facilities, and indoor and outdoor activities, and the Shangri-La Mactan does fairly well on all those counts.

Unfortunately, too many things outweighed the positives in terms of our overall experience at the resort. First off, upon arrival in our room in the Ocean Wing we were extremely underwhelmed with it. We could have been in any basic, dull global hotel chain hotel room - it just did not feel like a Shangri-La room at all. This was compounded by the fact that when we booked, we believed that an Ocean Wing room included all the benefits of the Ocean Club.

The website booking page said nothing about a different room rate for the Ocean Club benefits, so if you are looking at staying in the Ocean Wing and you want the full Ocean Club package, you need to be sure that on the website you go to the Ocean Club page first and THEN click on “Reserve a Room” to see the different price options for the Ocean Club. We only figured this out after conferring with the staff, who also didn’t seem to be clear on how the site worked. This was confusing and very frustrating, given we booked months ahead of time.

We even got a call from the hotel's reservation manager 2 days' prior to arrival asking us if we wanted to take advantage of a F&B credit offer, with no mention at all that we'd booked an Ocean Wing room but apparently did not have the Ocean Club benefits. Again, this was extremely confusing and annoying and it was a disappointing start to our visit as we chose the resort and the Ocean Wing specifically because we wanted full Ocean Club/Wing benefits. Despite this issue, and going back to my opening comments about terrific service, the Duty Manager Terrence quickly recognised the situation and graciously offered us full Ocean Club benefits during our stay.

This was greatly appreciated and quite astute of Terrence as it was pretty clear my wife and I were very disappointed with the situation and it was a very quick and simple way to address our disappointment. Regardless, I really think that the rooms in the Ocean Wing desperately need a makeover, as they simply do not live up to Shangri-La standards, are not good value for the money and were a significant disappointment for us.

Also, be aware that even with the Ocean Club package many things at the resort cost extra. As example, near the main swimming pool there’s an outdoor games area which has a free pool table, but then they charge 250 pesos for only 30 minutes for a pool table in the E-Zone which seemed excessive. Also, the mini-golf course needs a significant refurbishment as well and yet that too cost extra (and has only 14 holes which is also strange.) We went down the road to another 5-star resort to have dinner one night, and their prices for wine and beer were (in most instances) about half the cost of the Shangri-La; as example, a San Miguel beer at the other resort was 95 pesos vs. 180 pesos at the Shangri-La.

Also, be aware that everything is ""plus-plus-plus"" on top of the price, as anything you pay for at the resort is subjected to two government taxes and also a service charge, and thus everything costs at least 25% more than is advertised. I was told that the service charge actually goes to the employees (so that not just restaurant workers get tips but everyone from the servers to the desk staff to the cleaning crew get a cut of the service fees) which hopefully is the case as given the exemplary service they provide they all deserve it!

All in all, the resort has great promise but too many annoying factors really let it down for us, especially as a Shangri-La property. That being said, if you are looking for a great family resort and the above feedback doesn’t really put you off, I’m sure you can have a great time at this property.",Value for money:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed here for four nights, because we could not go to Malapascua due to the typhoon. The hotel and hotel surroundings are very nice. The beach is great and there is plenty of beach chairs. The pool area looked very good for kids, with a lot of slides and other things to do. Breakfast is very good and the service throughout the hotel is great. The snorkeling on the house reef i suprisingly good, and I have snorkeled many places. On the downside; there is not a lot outside of the hotel and it is quite expensive to eat and drink here. There is a restaurant across the street from the hotel that is ok, but nothing more.

"Our family booked 2 rooms recently and while the service was excellent, below are a list of faulty items we experienced across only 2 rooms (I hate to think what a full audit of the hotel would uncover):

1. Mini Bar fridge not working, all drinks in it were warm - after reporting it, two tradesmen lugged up a new one for us and replaced it (slight inconvenience for us)
2. Sliding door going to the balcony was faulty and couldn't be locked (tradesmen were sent and it was repaired)
3. Room safe was faulty and wouldn't work (took 24 hours for it to be repaired / replaced)
4. Toilet roll holder was broken (didn't bother reporting this one but noted it was repaired the next day)
5. 2nd room was booked and pre-paid for 3 people so it was disappointing that the room wasn't set up for 3 (again once reported the extra bed was set up for us).
6. A visible amount of caviar was left on the furniture indicating inadequate cleaning.

"I stayed in this fabulous resort with my boyfriend last March 2013 and it was so perfect! Travelling 22+ hours, the first thing we did was indulge in the Hilot massage at Chi, The Spa. The masseuse was very attentive and it was a great way to start the weekend. Then, we enjoyed a wonderful breakfast at Acqua, followed by lunch at Tides for some rice & crispy pata, and lounged by the beach with fresh coconuts delivered to us by the friendly and courteous staff. There really is no good reason to leave the resort because they have activities for families, a pool to cool off if you don't want to be at the beach (not sure why you wouldn't - it's gorgeous!). There are about six different restaurants within the resort as well, and they serve American dishes as well as delicious Filipino food.

"I am writing this review so others will not have to go through the extremely disappointing experience that we had!

1. Arrival - Front Desk was short-staffed and there was a long queue.
We had made reservations for 2 Rooms (1 Suite and 1 Deluxe). It took 2 hrs. for the Deluxe Room to be ready, and another 2 more hrs. for the Suite Room to be ready. A total wait time of 4 hrs after the official check-in time is absurd!

I requested Front Desk if we could temporarily have a Room where my elderly aunt, who was traveling with us, could rest but to no avail. We were very disappointed to say the least. We were so looking forward to check into our Rooms after a very tiring day of travel, clean off and relax. Instead, we were told to go and wait at the Lounge while our Rooms were readied.
To make matters worse, I had the unfortunate experience of dealing with an ill trained Hotel Staff, who as I understood it, was the ""Manager"" on duty at the Lounge.

There was only 1 Bathroom outside the Lounge, and it was occupied. As I stood there waiting, she happened to pass by, and she asked me if there was a problem. I told her - Yes, such a huge Hotel and there is only 1 Bathroom. She snapped at me, and answered in a condescending tone - ""This is only the Lounge and not the entire Hotel"". To which I asked her - isn't the Lounge part of the Hotel? She answered back in the same condescending and patronizing tone - ""I will tell the General Manager"", and then left.

I found this insulting. No words of assurances that the matter will be looked into! Such attitude from a Manager is setting the bar too low for the rest of the employees. A manager should have the knowledge and skill to handle a complaint effectively. The Hotel Staff should put an effort into making sure that they provide each guest equally with a good Hotel experience possible.

2. Wheelchair - When I made the Reservations, I specifically indicated that we have a physically challenged individual traveling with us.

The wheelchair that they gave us had a broken footrest. When I asked that it be changed, I was told that there was NO other wheelchair available. They assured me that they will come to our Room and replace it first thing in the morning. When nobody came the next day, I decided to call and follow up on it. It took them 3 hrs to bring in the replacement. But the situation did not get any better, because one of the locks of the replacement wheelchair that they brought in, was also broken. And once again, we were told that it was the only wheelchair that was available!!!

As to why this Hotel continues to offer broken wheelchairs for guests to use is beyond me! The cost to repair a wheelchair is very little, but the cost can be dire if an accident were to happen from using a broken wheelchair. These wheelchairs are very dangerous for anyone to use, much less for a person with a disability.

3. Front Desk Safe Room - Not secure.
I opted to check my personal valuables at the Front Desk safety box. I noticed that the Safe Room door is left open and unlocked. I called the attention of the Staff to it, how it was so easy for anyone to gain entry into the Room. He was nonchalant with his response, and said to me -""Just close it"".

4. Departure - PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU CHECK YOUR HOTEL BILL! Erroneous Bill was sent to our Room.

I had to go to the Front Desk, and wasted a lot of time discussing the Bill with them. Their explanation was - ""It was an error in our system"" (whatever that means!), followed by a generic one liner apology of ""Sorry for the inconvenience"". Well, finally, my FIRST ever and ONLY apology from this Hotel!

We normally stay at Shangri-la properties because of their competent and outstanding service. However, the service at this Hotel is spotty at best. This Hotel could have been a nice go-to place for a little R and R, because of its proximity to Manila and to the local airport. However, it is NOT up to par with the other luxury Hotels, including the other Shangri-la Hotels, in the Philippines or abroad.

Every part of this resort is well maintained and tastefully decorated to give an island feel.

Our room had everything you would expect from a 5 star resort, and then some. The rooms are spacious and the bed is luxuriously soft and comfortable, as well as a bathroom equally large with separate shower and bathtub. But the other great things with the room are the turndown service, fruit on arrival, water bottles topped up twice daily, great quality bathroom amenities from l'Occitane and lots of it, loofahs and bath salts to help you relax, in room slippers and flip flops for the pool and beach, free in-room wifi, laundry powder, dental kits, pillow menus in case you're fussy about your pillows and every plug in the room is an international plug.

When you leave your room, there is absolutely lots of stuff to keep you occupied. This is true for both adults and kids. The pool area occupies a big space, with water guns, a waterfall, kids wading pool and 2 separate separate waterslides for kids catering for different age ranges. You may also be tempted to sleep in one of a few hammocks scattered around the pool. Plenty of deckchairs are available and the staff are so attentive and set up your chair with towels to ensure maximum comfort. This is also true if you decide to relax on a chair on their exclusive beach. The beach also opens out over some coral where you can enjoy some snorkelling. When you're not swimming, there is a 9 hole golf course, 18 hole mini-golf, arcades with games, a Wii and Knect, all for a small fee. There are free pool tables in the arcade or outside by the pool, plus table tennis, a library or if you're up for it, their modern and fully equipped gym.

For eating and drinking, there is no shortage of options. Depending on the cuisine you're after, there are restaurants for Chinese, Italian/mediterranean, grill/bbq, seafood, Filipino and burgers. Breakfast is a large assortment of everything, from local Filipino items, Japanese and Korean, cold cuts and general Western items. Breakfast venues have omlette stations and noodle stations as well. Although we were booked in the Ocean Club and had access to breakfast in the lounge, the options were much better in Acqua and Tides. Try the seafood in Cowrie Cove, with their generous, yet delicious serves. Plenty of bars are dotted on the property. Find one by the beach, the pool, up by the pier or in the lobby with live music. Since we had access to the Ocean lounge, we made use of the peace and quiet the lounge offered during the day, as well as the afternoon pre-dinner drinks and food offered complimentary.

For those that want the ultimate relaxation, the Chi spa connected to the resort is out of this world. It is a 1 hectare property, almost as if it's a completely separate resort, with individual treatment rooms.rices are much cheaper than what you pay in Europe or Australia, so definitely try for the experience.

Finally, the other factor that made our experience truly the best was the friendly service. Everywhere we went, we were greeted with a smile by courteous staff, even the ground maintenance and gardeners. We noticed how good staff were with the kids, entertaining the, by the beach, the pool and restaurants. For those with kids, there are also kids activity centres and staff there are also fantastic with the kids.

I can not recommend this place enough. Definitely come for an enjoyable and relaxing time, with or without kids.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This is my 3rd stay at shang mactan and it is indeed an excellent stay as always. From the airport rep and the driver who picked us up, they're very courteous and polite. The gsa who welcomed us, she's really nice and very much willing to assist. And to the concierge for their initiative to help. The service is impeccable, the facilities are very clean and luxurious, the wifi is totally awesome, u have signal everywhere even on the beach and while walking around the resort! Amazing! Though the price of the room is a bit expensive but its actually reasonable because of the facilities and service, but the food and drinks prices in the outlets is outrageous.. Better eat outside, there's a sutukil nearby.. It was also my belated gift for my sister and the guest relations team have done a very great job in fulfilling our small requests and going beyond our expectation. A very special thanks to Julie for taking care of us through out our stay, she's an asset to the hotel as she always looks after all the guests not only us (as what ive noticed while we were waiting for our transpo to the airport) and she knows how to deal with each one of them. I myself is also a manager in the front office that's why i kept on observing each and every staff :) in my opinion, i think she deserves to be on a higher position. Will definitely stay here again on my future visit in cebu.. Cant wait!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We had done some research for our first family trip to Cebu and we were glad that we had chosen the Shangi-La. The resort is just a short trip from the airport and has an (artificial) beach and lots of fish in the sea. The family room was excellent, even it was not in the nicer ocean wing as we had booked. It seems our room had just been renovated and apparently re-classified. We went to all restaurants and food was good, but there seems to be a large price difference between locally available items such as chicken and imported food such as steak. The resort is ideal for kids with several pools, a small 'waterpark' and an indoor kids area with playpark (fee) On the other hand, the Spa was 'off limits' to kids. We also checked out the Moevenpick next door which has only a small beach and is next to a kind of port, but has a disco.

Though the resort is spacious, it felt very crowded during our stay around Xmas, even before the peak season on New Year. There were long waits to get an available table for breakfast, even though they had set up additional facilites in the ballrooms (!) which were naturally not nearly as nice. Also there was no chance to get any sunbed by the pool after 9 am or go to dinner without a day's prior reservation. Some of these issues could be easily sorted out by e.g. not making breakfast mandatory or setting up more sunbeds or parasols during peak times.
The other thing we noticed several times was the apparent better service for some locals, such as being allowed to jump the long queue at breakfast or much more attentive service, while we had problems even to place an order. Still not sure whether these are regulars who know how to 'game' the system (e.g. by calling 15 min earlier to have a table ready), high-class people who are used to 'boss around' the locals or staff who shys away from English speakers. My hunch is that they are known as better tippers as I gave a ""baksheesh"" to the pool attentant when I secured the last available sunbeds for the family and he kindly offered to 'reserve' these for us also for the next day...

Other points :
+ Strangely, I could not withdraw cash from the ATM at reception, but the ATM (from BPI) at the parking lot worked.
+ When we could not get dinner at the resort, we went outside. Just opposite the staff entrance behind the parking lot is the 'Hola Espana' restaurant which was good.
+ While the Shangri-la offers almost everything, I recommend to see more of the island and also do a shopping trip to a mall in Cebu City.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
This place is great. Staff is wonderful and very attentive. Room is always kept clean and crisp. The beach is beautiful. The only downside is the food. Please improve the food Shangri-La! The only place that was good was Tide's but it is very over priced. All in all I am giving it a four star review due to the positive attitude of the staffs.,Food:Staff:Location
"our first time to visit Cebu and chose this hotel because of the trusted shangri-la hotels. upon our arrival, a friendly private van picked us up at the airport. our stay was pre-purchased so the front desk personnel took us straight to our room and did the check-in process there. the family room was spacious and perfect, it has a separate living area, 2 queen beds, a veranda, and a view of the sea. we stayed for 4 nights and did tons of different activities: played on the beach, fed the fish, kayaking, miniature golf, kiddie pool and slide. they have the best breakfast, lunch, and dinner buffets.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"When you stay at a Shangri-la you expect a certain standard and on the whole the Mactan resort did uphold these standards.
Unfortunately our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 2pm and the check in staff member was quite slow and unhelpful. We had to wait in the lobby bar while they cleaned it and in the meantime the staff forgot to come and get us when it was done. To apologise they offered us a free buffet dinner which was an appreciated gesture after a day of travelling to get there.
We were on the 8th floor, facing the front of the hotel, it was clean and quiet although we had expected the rooms would be bigger.

The Chi Spa was amazing! We had loads of treatments - body scrub and wrap, facials, massages etc and all were 5 star.

Considering the hotel was full the one thing that really stood out was it never felt busy. You could easily get a sun bed at your pool of choice or on the beach and there were enough staff in the restaurants etc.

This is not a cultural holiday. You wouldn't even know you are in the Philippines. However, if you are looking for a short weekend break at a resort then you couldn't go wrong with the Shangri-la Mactan.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"My husband and I stayed at the resort over the Xmas holiday. Overall we were pretty impressed with the level of service there and I would recommend staying at Shangri la Mactan.
We especially liked snorkeling in their Marine Sanctuary which is just I front of their beach. The part of ocean was really well preserved even though there was a ton of guests and we saw lots of interesting fish and coral. The instructor who lead the snorkeling activity was fantastic! He remembered our names throughout the stay and made us feel really comfortable.
Another highlight was the band who was playing at the lobby lounge at night. They were really good, we had such a good time there after dinner, singing along, dancing etc.
Overall, what stood out for us was the beach and excellent staff. We don't have kids, but I can see it would be a great place for a family vacation if you have small children too.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I had originally planned on staying at the Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa as the ""splurge"" hotel on our honeymoon. The luxury chain had really great reviews and the photos on tripadvisor looked awe inspiring. The thought of us sitting around for days going between the pool and beach seemed a bit daunting. I know normal people relax on vacation but we get bored very easily and are always on the move. Also, I read that the food and drinks were very expensive so I was turned off as soon as I heard that.

I still wanted to check out the resort so we bought a day trip package for 3500 Pesos (almost $80.00 a person). What an expensive day trip?!?! Then I rationalized that I've spent more on jet ski rentals, spa treatments, etc. so I quickly got over it.

Our taxi approached the grounds of the Shangri-La and it was incredible. The view overlooking the pool and ocean from the open air lobby was magnificent.

The staffed smiled and greeted us throughout our visit. I thought we would be treated like an uglystep child since we had to wear special ""day visitor"" bracelets but that wasn't the case at all!

The price included a lunch buffet in the Tides Restaurant. That was the first thing we did. The buffet was good but not exceptional. There was the usual noodle bar, grilled meats, lechon and sashimi.

I've never had Filipino ""Halo Halo"" before, its similar to the Cambodian shaved ice dessert with milk, beans, and other toppings you can choose from.

We went to lay by the man-made beach for a couple of hours and caught up on some reading. The beach staff quickly brought us towels without us even requesting any. The beach was almost empty. There were a few Korean tourists and another Western couple. I imagine most people cancelled their trip due to the recent events.

The reviews were right, the prices were expensive. Water was about $2.50 each and beers were almost $4.00 each compared to the .50 cents and $1.00 respectively that we pay elsewhere.

We moved towards the main pool after the sun went down. It was great to swim in the 7.5 Feet water, I hate when pools are too shallow.

Once the sunset, we were sad to leave but we headed back to our hotel.

Was it worth it? It was definitely a great experience but similar to resorts that we've visited in Jamaica and Cancun. I did appreciate the hotel being under occupied because we pretty much had the beach and pool to ourselves.

If you are visiting the hotel as a day trip, here are some things to know:

"I have stayed in the mactan resort several times and every time I discover something new. From the moment you enter into the lobby it's obvious that you are here to relax and enjoy. Everything is geared to providing you with the ultimate relaxation. The staff are just fantastic, there are several eating options I particularly enjoyed the seafood dining. The rooms are large and well equipped. This place exemplifies the shangri-la ethos.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
This hotel definitely lives up to the Shangri-La Hotel Group name. It has everything!!! From the moment you walk into the foyer/reception area you are greeted and nothing is too much trouble from any staff member. The beachfront is a relaxing way to spend the day with staff organising to put sun shelters around your beach lounge chairs. The best part is getting fish food from the beach attendants where you can sprinkle some around you in the water and all these lovely fish of various colours appear. There are 2 pool areas with one equipped with kids pool slides and activities. The Club room was definitely worth the extra money as the staff and facilities were great - you also get picked up and returned to the airport included in the Club room package. Breakfast was cooked to order and had so many choices. Evening cocktails were enjoyed with hot/cold nibbles. The only disappointed part was that guests could not wait to be served drinks and went and helped themselves to alcohol instead of waiting for the staff to serve them. The Shrine is a 5 minute walk down the street where there are markets to buy souveniers. Overall this hotel is located on the quiet side of the island where you can relax and enjoy your holiday.,Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We stayed here as a couple in April 2013. The hotel has various rooms types and we stayed in 3 different rooms and sadly for such a large hotel, they were not able to accommodate us to one room for a 7 day stay and we had to keep moving rooms.

Would not recommend the buffet at the main restaurant Tides as it was overcrowded inside and outside and the food was very average, try the other restaurants. The snorkelling is fantastic right at the hotel beach.
Beware of extra charges, even though we stayed in the ocean wing where airport transfers were suppose to be free as per our package, they still charged us on the way home and we tried to contact the hotel when we returned home several times but did not receive a response.

Overall good resort but very busy and overcrowded, would highly recommend for families and kids.",Food:Value for money
"My fiancee and I stayed for the two special nights of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day 24/12 December 2013. Using Golden Circle (Shangri-La's reward scheme) points , we upgraded our regular seview rooms to Ocean Club Wing / Horizon Club rooms , which provided extra amenities , 180 degree view of the ocean , seventh floor, nice balcony and use of the Ocean Club lounge , inclusive of breakfast and complimentarycocktails each evening.

This was peak season , of course, and the hotel was full.

The highlights of our pleasant stay were numerous . We particularly enjoyed strolling around the beautiful garden with its many exotic flowering plants and beautiful landscaping features , walking along the very well kept sandy beach, visiting Scotty's Dive shop which is most professionally run - we were greeted by Chris and Peter - we were both regreattably suffering from heavy flu like colds so we could not dive , which , as a dive master , was rather bad luck !

The Chi Spa is world Class and we commend the management for this very high class facility. We rated The Chi as the best spa experience we had ever enjoyed.

The breakfasts in the Ocean Club lounge were excellent , with most attentive and helpful staff, plus glorious panoramic views of the ocean and coast line from its eighth floor vantage point. We were advised the Lounge would be renovated in 2014 , which should make it top notch.

Evening cocktails in the same lounge were , however, a bit of a scrum due to the holiday season and folk determined to have their complimentary cocktails. We elected to venture to the peace of the Lobby Lounge , which opens out onto a most pleasing terrace overlooking the garden. A wise choice indeed.

There was only one unsatisfactory feature of the whole stay which was the ""specially requested"" at time of booking and confirmed , in writing , ""Traditional Christmas Lunch with roast turkey etc ""

The Christmas Day lunch , was served in the extremely busy (fair enough) , Tides Restaurent. Whilst we were expected , and were shown to a nice , reserved , table for two , the meal was not ready at our appointed time and frankly when it arrived , it seemed very much that it was reheated turkey joints and carvings from the evening before . Neither were any traditional vegatables served , further , those that were , arrived a considerable time after the turkeywas served. In a word , our looked forward to ""Traditional Christmas Lunch"" was a ...disaster. Our server , Pam , was extremely concered and attentive , she also understood our calm complaint. We also mentioned our disastification when we paid the bill and upon exiting the restaurent.

However , we were determined not to let that ""blip"" ruin an otherwise most enjoyable stay and we soon put it behind us.

This five star hotel is a great place to bring the family - of that there is no doubt. Lovely staff throughout , great service from the beach , to the pools , to the bars. Indeed superb pools , two large individual pool areas and with the large ""children friendly pool "" nicely positioned in the garden area.

The water sports facilities are excellent and the Dive Shop , first class. The choice of reastaurents is also good , excellent Chinese , Italian ""Aqua"" and sea food "" Cowrie Cove"" in addition to the buffet style Tides.

Would we go back - without doubt.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"I was very impressed with this resort from top to bottom. A world class resort starts with the people. How they managed to find this many staff who always have a smile, and go out of there way to assist is beyond me. I have stayed at many 5 star hotels with similar levels of amenities, maintenance and service, this location is spectacular but again easily duplicated. It the people that made it special.

That said some details-

1. Top of the price range for Cebu, but great value comparatively
2. Check in very smooth, we arrived early in the day and got a early check in, and for that matter a late check out.
3. The room is typical 5 star, good quality furnishings and linens, comfortable bed. The room was a little smaller than I prefer
4. Breakfast was included, the upcharge was only $20 US per room per night and was excellent, extensive choices with all the American staples, Local and Regional options. I never knew where to start and did not get to try everything I wanted to in 6 days.
5. Pools were about what you would expect of a resort of this caliber. The beach is completely artificial, man made, trucked in sand, but surprisingly, just perfect. I spent many hrs snorkeling and feeding the numerous fish with the provided fish food. Some are tame enough to eat out of you hand. Pool and beach service was excellent after the first day they fully anticipated our needs.

Again the staff are the real difference, warm, charismatic and an absolute pleasure to interact with. We will be back",Value for money:Staff:Food

"I always like giving feedback, and i always want to make sure feedback is objective. Let me start with the positive
(1) Room- fantastic! Sea view room is beautiful. Make sure you get the high floors. I would suggest 5F-7F, because it is stunning. Toiletries, bed, linens- 5 star- fabulous!
(2) Customer Service-- exceeding expectations! Let me mention a couple of names: Daniel at the front desk is very accommodating, always has a smile in his face. He made my first hour great as he made sure we are taken care of. The server at the Tides Lunch buffet, ""Rose"" is very friendly and accommodating. Great Job Shangril-a, we are extremely happy with everyone. Whenever you walk, someone would always greet us good morning/afternoon, always with a smile. We are all appreciative of these great gesture.
(3) Amenities--- i have travelled around the world, and i would say shangri-la mactan has 5-star amenities! Clean and well-maintained.
(4) Although i have not heard from their GM on the email i sent, i am thankful that his staff took care of my needs..It saus a lot on how management work, i do not feel bad about not getting a response from the GM, because the staff took over and made sure we are taken care of.

Areas for Improvement:
(1) Quality of Food
Tides - (+) I am very happy with the fruits, and fresh fruit juice- this compensated for all the other below par food. (-) I am not sure if you do a taste test with everything that you serve. This is not about the chef but more of the quality of the product. You serve 2 kinds of longanizza, I tasted the beef one- and it is not good. Lunch buffet (Nov 21) : your maja de blanca is awful, sapin sapin is awful: these 2 don't deserve to be in a shangri-la buffet.

Acqua (Nov 21)-- worst restaurant that i have tried. We ordered a risotto gamberi- it tastes like ""lugaw"" or porridge and it cost like Php 475+ tax and SC. Your pizza is ok (we got the one with anchovies), but nothing to be proud of.

In house Dining (Nov 21) -- Yang Chow - horrific. This is a simple food, and Shangri-la cannot do it right? I was disappointed.

Except for the food- my stay was awesome! Customer Service at its best!!!",Staff:Food:Value for money
The resort is huge and every corner is luxury. I had a birthday party for 50pax on the Ocean Pavilion way back 2009. Service won't disappoint you. I so love the place. I finally got back August 2013 to celebrate my husband's birthday. We indulged ourselves with the US$400 spa package in Chi Spa. We had our own private villa with complete amenities. The milk bath in a huge tub facing the well landscaped garden was superb! Complete body massage including facial treatment were great too.

I had not been there an hour when someone was taking the ice bucket off me to get ice for me and someone else was ordering room service for me.. you feel very lucky to be staying there !
I had just arrived from another hotel in Bangkok, that itself has brilliant service but the Shangri la takes it to a whole new level !
I sleep really well when I stay at there and although technically a work trip, I love it when I get chance to use the beach area which is beautiful and the pool looks magical in the evening when I manage a swim.

We arrived in Cebu not too sure what we would find but thinking the best way to support the local economy in the aftermath of the terrible typhoon was to come and stay rather than cancel. I am so glad we did. The resort is fantastic. The staff are fantastic. It's business as usual and although terrible things have happened only 100km away the resort is top notch and I have never experienced better customer service in my life. I would definitely recommend anyone who has planned or is thinking of coming to stay here to do so as the hotel is awesome and the staff are even more so. It's the perfect place to travel with kids and the airport and hotel are all functioning as normal - in fact even better than the two times we have stayed here before.

The staff must have been terribly worried about their friends and family but it didn’t affect them one iota. Grace under pressure. On a normal day you will enjoy superb pools, a great beach, superb snorkelling, terrific number of options for kids. I‘d love to return and certainly wouldn’t risk going somewhere else to see if it was better. It can't be - can it!!",Food:Staff
"We have stayed 6 days there, I love there very much. It is the place where can keep you entertained without leaving the resort. It has the best part of the beach in the area with where with clear water that you can just snorkeling checking out colorful fishes, starfish and coral. We are lucky that bring with the waterproof camera with us and has taken a lot of beautiful under water world pictures. Then there is tennis court, 6 holes mini golf, 2 pools and full equipped health club. You will have penalty much to do in the resort. A free shuttle bus is offered by the resort taking you to the SM mail if you likes to go to the town. One thing you won't want to leave the resort, especially after one day we went wonder around outside of the resort to look around. The surround area is kind of impoverished that won't make you feeling safe. Even I found a SPA called Tree Shade very closed to the resort, the surrounded environment have told that not safe to go alone! If you like stay at a resort being relax and do not bother to go outside, this is the best one in Mactan Island.
The CHI SPA will never let you down, it keeps it's excellent standard in every CHI with Shangri-La location!

"Hi, I am from Cebu and every special occasion we are at Shangri-la. It was my birthday last Nov 8 when the super typhoon struck the country. We were already checked in the day before. All I could say is ""through thick and thin"" Shangri-la Mactan never fails to amaze us. They are consistently excellent and consistent in every area of service. Each staff, manager, heads of different departments from the front office to the restaurants to the housekeeping team everyone were just so accommodating and always initiated to ask what we needed every time. There was quite a panic during breakfast that Nov 8 since the peak of the wind was about to blow Cebu. But everyone was just so alert in assisting each guest from packing our breakfast to delivering to our rooms if needed. Just the sight of a prepared team assured us that we are in good hands. Great job Shangri-la Mactan team, excellent service from start to finish!

"Cebu was hit by one of the worst typhoons ever about 2 days before I arrived. But the resort is virtually untouched by the devastation in the surrounding region. The lobby is open and spacious with marvellous views of the ocean. The staff are all friendly, warm and helpful without exception. This despite the challenging times of the typhoon with many having relatives and friends who may have been affected by the typhoon.
The rooms are large, comfortable and beautifully appointed. The bathroom has everything one could need with lovely toiletries and warm water with good pressure. Take an ocean view room and enjoy a cold drink on the balcony while looking at the pool and beach.
Snorkelling is a must! This is the only place you can swim out to the corals in waist deep water. Numerous multicoloured fish swimming in the corals were a delight!
The breakfast buffet at Tides at Garden level has a great selection. My personal favourite is the garlic rice with a local salted fish called dangit.

We only stayed one night but I would definitely come back - great option for families. Also has very good food in the restaurants.

My children had so much fun snorkeling, kayaking, jetskiing and building sandcastles. We enjoyed feeding the fish early in the morning. They are very colorful and calming to look at. Life vests are provided in both the beach and pool area. Beach toys are provided as well. They also enjoyed the big and mini water slide.
surprisingly, I didn't enjoy the breakfast like before. Maybe because it was overcrowded during our stay. But they have a wide array of breakfast buffet. Acqua pizza and risotto are a must try. My children also love Scoops ice cream.
Overall, we had a very memorable stay. The place is very child friendly. If you love the beach, Shangri-la's is well kept and clean.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"As a Canadian Expat living in Cebu, I've had to really adjust my expectations with certain things, especially the quality of service. Don't get me wrong; everyone is more than willing to please, warm, charismatic and an absolute pleasure to interact with. Unfortunately, most places fail to offer pro-active, forward-thinking service.

This is far from being an issue at this Shangri-La property.

I simply couldn't say enough about the staff. The recruitment and training teams deserve a lot of credit as not only are the staff very personable they are exceptionally trained.

My family and I have stayed at this property numerous times now; our stays have ranged from 1 to 4 nights long. On every occasion, our expectations have been exceeded and our positive experiences make us want to go back for more.

Check-in is fairly seamless and there always seems to be someone around to interact with my wife and daughter in the process. The bellboys are friendly and efficient.

The rooms are clean, modern and well appointed; we typically opt for their standard room as we never plan to spend much time in the room anyway. Despite this, we've been upgraded to ocean view rooms on a couple of occasions, which was nice of them. We did stay in a non-renovated room once and although outdated, it was still very clean but had a more rustic feel.

The property offers several restaurant choices but we especially enjoy their buffet due to the variety and quality. If there's one place where the service is a big disorganized, it's in the buffet restaurant primarily due to the chaos when it's busy.

The beach and pool staff are great. As I was taking diving lessons, my wife was walking to the beach with my daughter, and was carrying a bag on her shoulder. Out of nowhere, someone ran over to her and took the bag off her shoulder and carried it until they could secure a spot on the beach. Additionally, since we have a toddler, the beach staff always tries to save a nicely shaded spot for us under the huts, which is always appreciated. They bring beach toys without being prompted and really attempt to anticipate our needs.

This is a great place for families with children; they have an indoor kid's zone, plenty of outdoor space to run around, a kid's pool area and splash pad and generally speaking, the staff is excellent with children. This would also be a good place for couples or friends wanting to enjoy time together.

Their gym is also pretty decent compared to many other hotel gym's I've been to.

Does it compete with some of the top resorts in the world? No. Is it one of the best in the Philippines? Yes, and definitely the best in the Cebu region.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My family and I recently stayed again in this beachfront resort. It is about 15 minutes to/from the airport. For a party of 4, we took a metered airport taxi (color yellow) and cost about Philippine Peso 200 (about USD5.00). Note that taxis have luggage space for 2 suitcases. The taxi driver also offered his services for a tour of Cebu for P1,500.00 (about USD37.00) for 3 hours. If you prefer a vehicle that offers more space or are in a large group, you can get a van for a fixed rate. The taxi/van booths can be located on the right side as soon as you exit the terminal building. For first time visitors, i would recommend the hotel's own shuttle service. It is more expensive but with no worries. Look for a hotel representative within the baggage claim area.

It is a large family-oriented resort and since it has gone through several renovations, you would not think it is a 20 year-old property. It is very popular not only to foreigners but to locals as well. It can get very crowded on weekends. We got a main wing seaview deluxe room which was recently refurbished and with a good view of their sprawling grounds, the pools and a bit of the sea. We got a king-sized bed with a pull-down single bed (just ask for bed covers/blanket). The room size is standard with free wifi all over the property. Security is very good with roaming guards on each floor but the elevators are not yet key card operable.

There are lots of activities for the kids and adults. You can go to the beach (but can be rocky as you further go out to the sea) or try the several pools for kids and adults. There is a toddler/children indoor playground; a small video arcade with pool tables, air hockey, etc. You can also play table tennis, tennis, six-hole golf, mini golf, etc. They also have a lot of water activities such as scuba diving, kayaking, jetskiing, etc. They have a fitness center (with a trainor) and jacuzzi, steam and sauna facilities which was free for hotel guests. They also have a spa center but did not try it out.

Their breakfast buffet (P1,500.00/adult or about USD37.00) is available at their main restaurant, Tides, and is also available at another restaurant, Acqua. With many hotel guests, we had to wait in line at Tides (i noticed this throughout the morning). They even had to extend the dining area to the lobby of their ballroom.

There are no convenience stores/malls within walking distance from the resort so best to be prepared or you can take their shuttle service which goes to the 2 major malls in downtown Cebu. They have several trips throughout the day but costs P150/adult each way (about USD4.00). Kids 5 yrs old and below are free.

I have stayed in this resort several times in the past and i always leave with happy memories. It was indeed an excellent family weekend getaway. Although it is expensive, it is worth it. My family and i will definitely be back soon.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"I'm completely baffled by the high praise that continues to be bestowed upon this poorly run property.

The hotel is beautiful, without a doubt, and has aged well, for the most part. And the people are extraordinarily friendly... but attention to detail is not their strong suit.

On my first day, I had no air conditioning and no hot water. They dispatched a technician quite swiftly who was able to fix one, but not the other. Why would they even rent a room which most other properties would deem unsuitable for occupancy? ""Air Con"" would see to be a necessity in Cebu and an entry level requirement for a five star property. Another bare minimum requirement: drawers that open and close properly. None of the drawers in my room work... they all get stuck and you have to lift and pull to open, lift and push and glide to get closed.

I didn't have housekeeping service for three days, despite requesting it twice. And when I did finally receive the services of housekeeping, it was rudinentary at best. Used glasses, plates and utensils were not collected; towels and toiletries and burnt out light bulbs were not replaced. My stay immediately followed a 7-night stay at the Makati Shang in Manila and the difference can only be described as Night and Day. That hotel got nearly everything right, while the Mactan location gets nearly everything wrong.

A two hour boat ride was described at their activities desk as a ""sightseeing island hopping tour."" The only accurate part of that sentence was that it was two hours; the only sight we saw was the endless sea. Bottled water was advertised as being free on that excursion, but they only had one bottle per passenger.

One can't even sit up in bed at this hotel and lean against the headboard without having the bed slide forward... the bed is not attached. This may explain the incessant screeching and scraping one often hears from the room above you.

The buffet restaurant - Tides - is large and almost always crowded and noisy. The staff seems genuinely surprised every morning when large numbers of people show up to dine and ill prepared to handle the huddled masses yearning to eat free (many of the guests are on a dining plan or are diamond members within the hotel's frequent guest program, entitled to a complimentary breakfast for two).

And while the array of food is rather comprehensive and some of it can be quite tasty, a lot of it is rather thoughtlessly laid out... for instance, they have seven or eight bowls with different items at the salad bar, yet they have set out just one pair of serving tongs. Guests must wait their turn to use them. And the bowls are so shallow that they hold enough salad greens for just two or three people. And refilling buffet items is not something they do terribly quickly here. That's true not just at the salad bar, but throughout the buffet... and not just at breakfast, but throughout the day. Items which are common at other Shang buffets - like smoked salmon - are conspicuously absent here.

Ordering off the menu at Tides is hit and miss... they're so focused on the buffet patrons, that it's a relative rarity that they have to actually wait on customers, other than bringing them drinks and clearing plates. Consequently, they don't do that very well. I ordered off the menu last night: I asked for a starter, a cheeseburger and a Coke Light (Diet Coke). The server first said she would ask the chef if he could do a cheeseburger. I pointed out it was on the menu! (And even if it wasn't.. they offer burgers... and they have cheese... it wouldn't be too hard to imagine that they could combine them).

She came back ten minutes later to ask me again what I had ordered. I repeated the order, then she disappeared. And I never saw her again, until I spotted her twenty-five minutes later (thirty-five minutes after having been seated), with a large tray of drinks for another table and no Coke Light. Thirty-five minutes in and not only had I not been brought a starter, I hadn't been brought my Coke Light or even a glass of ice water. I waked out, mentioning the poor service to the hostess, who remembered me from having seated me a half hour earlier. She apologized, but didn't offer to send my meal to my room, as I would expect a restaurant hostess at a five star hotel focused on customer satisfaction would be trained to do.

I went back to my room and ordered room service. It arrived less than twenty minutes later, but the burger was practically raw, when I had ordered it medium well and there was no ketchup. The starter included three different types of satay - Beef, Chicken and Shrimp - and arrived stone cold. And only the chicken was edible. The beef was stringy and the shrimp mealy.

I'm writing this review now because I have not been able to get to sleep... for the past four hours, there has been constant hammering, drilling, scraping and yelling in the guest room across the hall. I finally called down to the ""Service Centre"" and asked if there was construction going on. I was told no. I said it certainly sounded like construction to me. She said, no, but that she ""would get them to stop.""

I found this confusing. If there was no construction, then exactly whom would she ask to stop and what is it she would ask them to stop doing? She said this was a matter for her Duty Manager. And about ten minutes later, sure enough, there was more commotion and yelling in the hallway, along with several carts containing tools and paint and other signs that guest room renovation was indeed underway. So that's some small measure of success, I guess... they stopped construction after terrorizing the entire floor for more than four hours. But now it's started up again... intermittent drilling. That qualifies as ""Quiet Work"" at the Shang, i suppose.

As I said, it's a lovely hotel, and I'm sure the staff mean well... but they're really not ready for prime time, especially when you consider what it costs to stay here.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed here for a week. Very nice hotel. All the things you need in a beach resort are there. When I go back to Cebu, I need to stay here again.

"Our first visit to Cebu and we stayed at Shangri-La Mactan. We read the reviews on Tripadvisor and were not quite sure what to expect from such a big resort.
We had a wonderful experience from the food to the service and everything else in between.
The hotel is definitely geared up for entertaining children, fantastic facilities!! Children friendly hotel and a joy for adults too. Beautiful manicured lawns/gardens and well maintained pool and facilities. The service and staff were excellent, right down to the very attentive Lifeguards. The staff at Shangri-La Mactan are a credit to the hotel.
What we also loved about the resort is that we do not feel like the hotel is calculating in certain respects (like some big resorts around the region are). A good example was when we requested for a roll away bed for one of the 2 rooms we booked. We expected to be charged extra for it but it was complimentary. These are the little things, we as guests, take notice and truly appreciate.
We will definitely be coming back and next time we will stay longer (as suggested by our 7 year old)!!

The beach and pool areas were very nice and a ton of fun. We also used the mini-putt and table tennis. The Shang-Mactan met our expectations as we've been to the Shang-Macati and Shang-Edsa.

As always, the pools and beachfront area are absolutely clean and pristine. Staff are always within sight and ready to assist you with anything. Needless to say, the rooms themselves are excellent.

"Stayed here for 5 days back in August. This is the my first stay at a Shangri-la and had high expectations. I was not disappointed. Although I was told that this facility is an older one, I did not notice at all. Staff were wonderful, courteous and very helpful. I ate a a couple of restaurants and both were fine. For breakfast, I ate at Tides everyday of my stay and did not tire of the food. One thing I will always remember is how good, and fresh, the mangos were. I guess Cebu is known for its mangos. The hotel is about 15-20 minutes from the airport. The trip to Cebu City takes about the same amount of time depending on time of day. There is a market nearby but I do not recommend just walking as the sidewalks are near non-existent and the neighborhood around the hotel looks a bit dodgy. As with other hotels in the Philippines, there is a security check upon entering the hotel property with requisite bomb sniffing dog. Do not miss a chance to go to a Su-Tu-Kil which is down the road for some awesome seafood.",Food:Location
"Views and water were amazing. Spa experience was unforgettable (like the price :=)) but there's a also a free area in the Chi spa for those who would just like to wind down. All the employees were very attentive to our needs. In the restaurants, when we ask the waiters for something that is not on the menu, their answer was always that they could ask the kitchen to make it for us and they did! We stayed there 4 days, 3 nights, and had the daily buffet breakfast at Tides. We ordered the native cocoa breakfast drink each day to complement our meal. On the last day, we decided to switch to Aqua for breakfast. When our regular waiter at Tides knew that we were at Aqua, he walked over and brought us our native cocoa drink - something we never expected anyone would do. Really touched all of us. It made our stay there all the more special because of people like these.",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Stayed here with a group of friends and it was great. The service is the usual shangri-la high standard, and the staff was always friendly and eager to help.

There's a lot to do on the resort if you don't plan on venturing out. A couple of pools, nice beach. Lots of kids around, so it's family friendly. The restaurants aren't bad, either.

We didn't try the spa services - instead found a very good (and much cheaper) place called the Tree Shade, just five minutes walk up the main street. They have a pick up / drop off service too. Excellent value, give it a try!

For the more adventurous, try the local bbq chicken and roast pig from the street vendors. 100 pesos for a whole roast chicken!",Food:Staff:Location

"If you are visiting Cebu, this is the resort for you. A quick fifteen minutes from the airport and you are in paradise.

My eight-year-old and fourteen-year-old sons loved this place. It is a child's paradise with so much to do on the resort. World-class snorkeling right off the beach. My youngest loved feeding the fish. If you are not a snorkeler or scuba diver, no worries. There are plenty of quiet places to relax and enjoy the sun and surf.

There are plenty of activities including miniature golf, pool tables, indoor kid's playground with great planned age-appropriate activities. The pools are nice and include basketball hoop and volleyball net and balls. While being family friendly, it is also a great place to relax. There are plenty of quiet places to unwind across the resort.

This resort stands out for it's high quality service and friendliness of the staff. I highly recommend staying in the Club level Ocean Wing. The view of beach is great and access to the club lounge makes the stay extra luxurious. The lounge staff are some of the most attentive and friendly I've met in my world travels.

The clincher is really the service - operations run like a well oiled machine, with upbeat staff that greet you at every turn. This Shang has aged gracefully.

Only peeve is that final touches are being put on some rooms for the refurbishment. Gentle hammering and dragging of furniture were audible past midnight. Management should know better that sound travels and stop work earlier.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

The rooms are a good size, well appointed, contain all the things you need, are clean, and modern. All rooms will get a view, some over the pool and the sea, the others over the gardens towards Cebu.
The buffet breakfast is first class, and the staff service was impecable.
The pool area is very good, with areas for kids, adults, water slides, and things to play in the pool, like volleyball or basketball. The beach area is nice but not huge.
Pool side attendants for food, towels, or the life guards are all attentive to the guests.
The price is high compared to many in Mactan, and Cebu, and its in this area that I feel the hotel loses out. For not a lot more, when they have specials, you can get a pool villa at another nearby resort which I feel is a better resort.

"Stayed at the Shangri-La Mactan in Cebu in August when we were competing in the Cobra Half-Ironman race weekend. Cebu as a destination for a weekend from HK fell off my radar many years ago after one too many friends came back with very underwhelming reviews. Have to say that after my recent stay at the Shangri-La Mactan, I would go definitely go back. The staff were incredibly friendly, from the gardener, to the pool guys, to the front office staff - everyone was smiling, pleasant, helpful - literally blew Thai hospitality out of the water. The pools were amazing. As far as resorts go the food (and price - they don't gouge you which was a breath of fresh air for the Shang) was also above average. To be fair, there were 2000 people there that weekend for the triathlon so the kitchens were handling the massive stress test very well. And the private beach with fishes, shells, marine sanctuary and white sand at your door step was stunning.

Couple of annoyances: We stayed in an ""ocean view"" room, which had a pretty average view, most of which was blocked with palm trees. Wouldn't pay for the ocean view again as you're out of the room most days in front of the ocean anyway. The room did NOT include wifi (which continues to boggle my mind) and you had to go to the business center to apply for the ridiculously priced wifi (which was something ridiculous like USD 20 per day) and it was still painfully slow. Surely, Shangri-La, it's time for you to invest in a good inhouse wifi system.

Don't have kids, but we had some friends who brought their children along (quite young as well) and they raved about the babysitting service, all of whom were registered nurses. They said they would go back in a heartbeat.

All in all, Cebu is 1 hour flight from HK, so within 5 hours door to door, you can get yourself to a white sand beach with friendly service and all the amenities you might need. I look forward to going back.",Staff:Value for money:Internet
"I had a great time staying in the hotel. Reviews from the other travelers are spot on. Wanted to add things that may not be covered.
(1) Free WiFi available all the way up to the beach. I found this is such a value added facility especially when I need to communicate with my roomies on our whereabouts (save money from roaming charges)
(2) The hotel is pretty 'secluded' and pretty much 'self-sufficient' but if you need a break, there are scheduled shuttles available to the malls (for a fee). Traveling time to the mall is approx. 40 min. But if you have more than 2 pax in your party, taxi is probably more cost-effective.

During our stay there, the hotel was packed. The pool and beach were crowded and apparently it was a holiday week in Korea, and I guess this is a favourite place for the Koreans. I like to stay in hotels during off-peak season to avoid the crowd but we were there for a wedding. We managed to find places away from the crowd (which we strategically planned) for e.g. we had breakfast at 930 am when most families are already up and about and they are at the beach or the pool. So, the buffet line was not so packed (exception on Saturday where there were so many people, our theory was most of the guests are checking out and many had late breakfast). The hotel gave us a late check-out on Sunday (maybe our theory was right) as our flight home was at 6pm. That was really appreciated and we get to enjoy the hotel more.

The hotel has a huge lobby bar with comfy chairs. Spent some time there after breakfast to chill and the staff did not create a fuss when we only asked for cold water whilst we were there. We really appreciated that.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"We choose this hotel on our Philippines vacation 2013. Being a Cebu native and my wife from Manila I want to show her what Cebu can offer. Her friend from San Francisco vacationed in this hotel 2012 and she was so mesmerized by the pictures. We had been to Plantation Bay in 2007 after our wedding in Manila and she said we should give Shangri-la Mactan a try. Upon entry the hotel façade is very nice as it is tucked away from the main road and there's a lot of trees across the hotel entrance that makes you feel away from the hassle and traffic of city life. Their main lobby is a bit dated but sparklingly clean. Hotel staff are very courteous and friendly. Our room is very mediocre size for its $400/night rate. There is no microwave and the mini bar fridge is stocked with over priced drinks. Imagine a coke 12ounce can is 125 pesos($2.90) and you can buy it from the grocery across the street for 29 pesos($0.70cents). One thing I like on this hotel is NO CORKAGE FEE to delivery foods. I ordered McDonalds delivered to me in the hotel and no corkage!!! You can't do that in Plantation Bay. The beach is okay considering Punta Engano is never a white sandy beach its natural coastline is rocky. Their white sand was delivered by barge from Inabanga Bohol and dumped to their coastline to mimic a white sandy beach. This was an environmental issue back in 1991-1993 when the hotel was just constructed. Back to my review, there are 2 swimming pool and a mini golf area. One swimming pool is near the beach but small and one is close to the main building and this is the huge one. There's a lot of Japanese and Koreans I guess these are there main target patrons. There is also a water slide that I didn't care as my 4yo daughter is not tall enough to ride on it. Then theres the mini water park which my daughter enjoyed. Breakfast in this hotel is so-so. A lot of Japanese and Korean food and a few Filipino food. I had more sumptuous selection for breakfast in Manila Hotel. All in all the place is very expensive for the experience.

"We stayed at the Shangri-La for our stop-over holiday between living in Australia and returning to America. We splurged and got a 1 bedroom suite in order to provide separate sleeping areas.

There was always a table available at breakfast. The kids (ages 9 and 6) enjoyed the kids club, though the 6 year old loved it more. Very convenient to have a Dive Shop on the grounds. My son did the PADI Bubble-maker course and got out on the reef. I had my first dive in 11 years.
So relaxing by the pool or the beach. Great happy hour specials down at the beach bar. The food was good but not great (compared to other Shangri-La resorts we've been to). Best selection at the breakfast buffet and good quality at the dinner buffets.

"Almost every year, if my family and I want to go to a place to just unwind for a week, Shangri-La Mactan is definitely the first place that enters our mind. The food is great, the staff has always been very friendly and helpful. Of course, the only ""downside"" to this is that it is expensive compared to nearby beach resorts. You know what they say...you get what you pay for.",Staff:Value for money:Food
"Its a lovely resort with very friendly staff, BUT if you have a problem you may not be happy. I was given a room that had just been refurbished, so was lovely but thought there maybe teething problems. No hot water on first day but didn't complain as I thought this would correct itself. It didn't. Day 2. complained 1st thing in morning and was told it would be sorted. 5pm still no hot water. complain again and told an engineer would be straight there, 15 minutes later have to phone again. told engineer was on his way and would be there immediately, 10 minutes later one finally appears and agrees the water is cold!!!!!!

This was our second time being there yet the place, the staff, and the service never fail to satisfy and amuse us.

"Good location with beautiful garden and nice beach . The sea view rooms are really nice with large balcony. The room was nice and spacious but the bathroom needed an upgrade .
We could never enjoy the complimentary massage as the Spa was always fully booked , what is the point of offering a complimentary massage if you can't have it ?
The food was really disappointing at all restaurant , the buffet is really average .
We loved most the beach as it was clean and we greatly enjoyed snorkeling in the natural reserve .",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"This hotel is only ok. I wouldn't call it a great 5 star hotel but it's not a bad 4 star hotel, IMO.

I feel compelled to make this point to anyone who is considering this hotel for a vacation. The lifeguards at this place are totally ridiculous. For one, I have never seen so many lifeguards at 1 place in my life. They blow their lifeguard whistles incessantly and stuff the pool rules down the guests throats. I literally saw 2 lifeguards harass one middle age gentlemen with his two young children because they were not certain the t-shirt he was wearing was a rash guard swim shirt (which apparently is a pool rule). These people are totally ridiculous and the act like the police. It makes it really difficult to relax and enjoy the pool with the crazy lifeguards constantly eyeing you and killing you with silly rules and whistles. It goes way beyond safety. And I have kids and fully appreciate the virtues of a safe swimming environment but this is way over the top and kills the vibe.

I've stayed at my share of 5 star hotels and this place doesn't really compare at that level. If you want to hang out at the pool and relax, I would avoid this place.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"Room accommodations was ok. It was more luxurious at Radisson where we stayed prior to transferring to Shangrila-La. Food was ok as well (meaning not that great) for the amount of money you pay. Again, Radisson had more delicious food and a lot more selection for their buffet. Overall the value for money wasn't there.",Value for money:Food:Location
"Stayed in the Shang twice and its been awesome. Super family friendly. The food is awesome whether it be the buffet breakfast or burger by the pool or pizza at the Italian restaurant. The service is pretty good as you'd come to expect from Shangri La chains and this is the short of hotel that u can easily spend a week and never feel the need to leave the hotel premises. The facilities are also awesome especially the games room.

The only caveat which I hope mgmt has fixed the problem, we heard some locals were let into the pool one day, and one of the security cameras CCTV caught a lady stealing something out of a tourist's bag.

Highly recommended if you are looking for 5 star accomodation at Cebu.",Food
This was my first stay here. The staff and accommodations were fantastic! Plenty of choices for food. The pools and beach were awesome. While we didn't have kids with us I was amazed at the amount of activities they provide for children of all ages. Thanks for a great stay. Close to the airport which is nice as after flying it's only a short taxi ride.,Staff:Location
"The best summer destination for me and my son, Elmo, is Shangri-La’s Mactan Resort & Spa. We spent our first summer together here and came back a couple of times after our first visit in 2012. We had so much fun! For someone like me who loves the beach so much and at the same time has to make sure my baby can join in the fun, this place has everything for us. From water sports like the jetski, kayak and sea trek to chilling by the beach in the afternoon, a dip in the pool by evening, some cocktails and great food with friends at the Cowrie Cove while my Elmo is playing in the Toddler Zone. Maybe even a relaxing sauna session or jacuzzi hot tub bath with the ladies – this is our best summer experience together so far!

And since my baby was only a little more than a year old when we were here, the friendly staff gave us a free baby cot without waiting for us to ask for one!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We have booked this hotel on recommendation and we were not disappointed. The only hesitation to book was the very high price, especially for Philippine standards (US350/night standard room). In our case we travelled with a 1 year old baby and we spent 4 days in the resort without leaving outside. So for the quality time we spent we found that it was worth paying a bit more then usual for a hotel. And indeed If you have children this really is a place to be.
There are many other children, child friendly staff and facilities for children: in and outdoor playgrounds, baby pool, baby club (above 3 years). For us the indoor playground for babies below 3 was very nice. Of course if you have children above 2 or 3 this really is a paradise! And for older children the snorkeling is nice too.

What we appreciated was the Wifi (included) and spread without the whole resort and all the F&B outlets. This made it possible for us to go out for dinner at night while leaving our baby in the room. There are many nice apps to use wifi as baby-phone. In our case we left the IPad in the room and monitored using the iPhone. We have tried all restaurants and it worked perfect. How nice to have dinner outside at the beach!

To evaluate the hotel. The hotel is clearly a bit older but very well maintained. It was not the most luxurious hotel I have ever seen and not the most perfect hotel either but this was not an issue. The staff was extremely well trained and professional. Without any exception staff was always correct, friendly and available to assist. A great compliment to the management! Unbelievable I have never seen such a high and consistent level before.

Breakfast was very nice with a good choice. As European we would have like better quality cheeses and cold cuts but we except that this might be difficult to source in the Philippines.

The only less nice experience we had was a dinner at the beach (cove restaurant) where we were thought that we were seated on a non smoking area of the terrace but we ended up next to a heavy smokers table (smoking even between and during dishes). The staff apologized but for us this dinner was spoiled. No real blame to the hotel.

Hotel was full with Koreans and Japanese and surprisingly little western people. We experienced the other guests as very pleasant.In general less loud and more polite then our own nationals. Positive experience.

What could the hotel improve:
- better information about entertainment programs upon arrival. We would have liked a guest book on the room with information about the restaurants, facilities and entertainment (maybe this was missing?)
- better non-smoking policy
- free airport pick up would be appreciated as the hotel is very close to the airport and it would improve the total guest experience
- lower prices :-) I understand that if the hotel is 90% full there is no need to question pricing ...

A clear recommendation for families. We will recommend this to friends",Food:Staff
"I had the pleasure of staying at Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa from 2-5 Aug 2013 for the Ironman 70.3 in Cebu. As the race hotel, Shangri-La provided the nearest access to the start point and hosted all the pre- and post-race festivities.
Located along what must have been the prime beach front on Lapu Lapu, the sprawling resort takes a bit of walking and exploring to soak in the entire range of services. The resort looked to be in need of a refresh, as the decor was looking a bit tired, and in some areas, a fresh coat of paint or new furniture were clearly needed.
As I was there for the Race, what I looked for in a hotel were very simply a good sized, well-appointed room so I can assemble and pack my bike and rest well before and after the race. Shangri-La Mactan did not disappoint on these areas - the room was large, with a good size shower, a nice balcony, and comes with free wi-fi as well as good satellite TV channels.
The resort boasts a variety of restaurants, ranging from a pool side bar, an Italian restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, and the main restaurant which was really huge. A good range of local and international food were available; the breakfast buffet is particularly well stocked. While I never went hungry during the entire duration of my stay, I was somewhat disappointed by the quality of the food, which ranged between plain inedible (very salty!) to somewhat average. As a triathlete, all I needed was good nutrition, so the lack of quality didn't really affect me.
Service staff at the hotel were plainly stretched during this period, when there must have been 2000+ triathletes with their families and the regular tourists lodged at the hotel. Calls to the operator were dropped; requests took longer than usual (kudos to the team for even being able to respond). But nevertheless, the staff adroitly pressed on with their task, always with smiles on their faces. Filippino and Cebuan hospitality more than made up for the hiccups.
Finally, don't expect a hotel stay on the cheap - Shangri-La Mactan is a premier resort, so expect to pay top dollar for the location.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"What a wonderful resort! Great pools! The Main Pool has a long water slide for the children and the Ocean Pool has a wonderful view of the beach. The beach is amazing with its own marine sanctuary. The water is so clear you can see the tropical fish from the shore. Snorkeling is a must. The staff is simply fantastic. After we checked out of the hotel and were at the airport, I realized that I had left my iPad Mini in the hotel room. A phone call from the airlines to the resort confirmed that my computer was indeed in the hotel room and the resort promptly sent it to the airport on its next shuttle bus. What a great great service! Will definitely come back to this hotel if we visit Cebu again! By the way, if you are traveling with children, make sure you get the Kids Adventure Zone package which includes lunches for your kiddos.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Shangrila Mactan Resort is well kept and clean. The hotel itself is at par with international standard. Life guards are every where at the beach and pools. This is the only hotel resort in Mactan with a small but decent size white sand beach where you can see tropical fish swimming with you in the crystal clear water, though it has no corals at all. Don't swim during low tide because the water becomes murky. Other resorts nearby (Plantation bay, Movenpick, Crimson, and Imperial) has rocky beach and murky water. Breakfast buffet has lots of choices. Gym and spa rooms are clean. Having said the good things about this hotel, I should also tell you its downside. The island of Mactan is poorly developed except for all the resorts. Immediately outside of each resort (including Shangrila), you will be very disappointed with the views. Roads are not paved, it floods after raining. Shanties are all over the islands and small kids and poor people hanging in the streets looking for work to do. Poverty prevails. It doesn't feel safe to get out of your resort at night. That being said, for Shangrila to charge $400 per night is too expensive. Although it has nice amenities and beach (compared to other resorts around Mactan), its immediate vicinity is not good at all. You are bound to eat all 3 meals inside the resort where they charge you an arm and a leg. There is a Korean restaurant just outside the gate of Shangrila Mactan if you want your purse/pocket to take a rest. I mean, with $400 per night, you are better off with a 3 night all inclusive package in any beautiful resort in the Caribbean. Overall, Shangrila Mactan is overpriced but it is the only beautiful resort in Mactan, Cebu. One time visit to this resort is more than enough.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We have just returned from a short break here where we stayed in the Ocean Wing. In general the hotel is up to the standard I have come to expect from Shangri-La resort hotels: nice clean environment, well designed and clean rooms, friendly staff, impressive landscaped grounds and top notch facilities for young and old(er). I have only really have one issue that I will raise although I should state that overall the experience was very nice.

I had big problems trying to contact in-room dining after 7 on Saturday night. It took nearly 5 minutes for someone to answer the phone (a simple answer saying you were busy would have been much better than just ignoring the phone) and when someone did finally answer, I was told there was a waiting time of 1.5 hours!! I would expect more from Shangri-La. In their defence though, earlier in the evening the food had arrived quickly, they just seem to lose it when the rush hour starts. Room for improvement.

Okay, on the more numerous plus side the facilities here are top notch. Great pools (both the general one and Ocean Wing private one) with a water play area for the small children and a waterslide for others. The beach(es) are clean and the water is absolutely gorgeous and safe for the youngsters to try their hand at snorkeling.

The grounds are well kept and very pleasant and there are some other entertaining options such as a putting green, crazy golf, badminton, swings, punchbags, ping pong and more.

Inside the entertainment is also very good with the Shangri-La's standard Adventure Zone area (with climbing frames and slides etc) as well as the e-zone that has some pool tables, fussball, air hockey as well as a small snack/coffee bar and an arcade machine room. All these e-zone facilities must be paid for via tokens and it's 10 tokens for 100 pesos. Good value.

The gym is well equipped - one of the better ones I have used at Shangri-La - with an excellent selection of Life Fitness machines, as well as a dumbbell rack, smiths machine, Olympic bench press and a versatile pulley machine that will keep most people happy. Inside the gym you can help yourself to fresh fruit as well.

The international buffet was very nice with a large selection of food from Japanese, Korean (this resort is very popular with both nationalities) and local as well as the usual pasta, rice, desserts, noodles etc. Very high quality and tasty food and certainly recommended.

Externally the hotel looks a little bit in need of modernisation, but inside the decor is very nice and the central atrium is very attractive. The staff are a credit to the hotel - extremely friendly and helpful.

All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable stay and one we hope to repeat in the future. I can certainly wholeheartedly recommend the hotel, especially so if you are a family with children of any age.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"We just got back from a family vacation in Cebu and it exceeded our expectations. I'm always a bit nervous when booking for my family because I don't want to disappoint them by booking at a terrible hotel. This place is great! My wife and I travelled with our 6 year old. It's very kid friendly and the staff are very helpful and friendly. The always make sure their hotel guests are well taken care of and that everyone has a good time. It's a very safe place so after we noticed how many staff were looking out for the kids, we allowed our daughter to run around and play with her new friends. Everyone always greets you with a smile and they remember your name. They made us feel like royalty.

We split our time between the pool and the beach. We met a nice employee named Crystal. She took care of all of our needs. The beach is very clean and I observed staff members cleaning it all day long. They really care for the natural environment that surounds the Shangri La. We did some snorkeling and paddle boarding. The water is crystal clear and there is an abundance of marine life. The beach is small but perfect for parents who want to keep a watchful eye on their kids. So my wife and I relaxed with a glass a wine while our daughter played. They have great 2 for 1 drink specials.

In the end, we had a late flight so we checked out and spent the day at the beach. Afterwards we showered in the health club which is beautiful in itself. Props to the hotel management staff. They are really running a well organized hotel with some of the friendliest staff I have ever met.

I couldn't really say anything negative about the place but if there is something which is really not a big deal, I would say that the restaurant ""Tides"" outside dining area could be cleaned up a bit quicker due to the birds massively attacking food when guests leave their food on the table. There were a few chairs that had bird poop on them.

One other thing is that the staff is not allowed to give you information on Cebu city because they don't want to take the responsibility in case something happens to you. Which I think translates into ""spend your money here and not in the city"" So that was a bit of a disappointment. I think the hotel should allow it because after a while, people want to try the local food at smaller less expensive places. Those would be the only improvements that I could see that would be needed.

Over all a great stay. We will definitely be back!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Me and my hubby love bringing our kids to travel with us so it is important for us to choose a kids friendly resort. Shangri-La's Mactan has done a great job in providing a big fantastic kids club for children to play and join their kids program. Besides, their babysitting service is very reasonable. As me and my hubby loves diving, our kids were then being taken care of by the babysitter. When we were back, their diapers were changed and new clothes were put on and they were ready to sleep!! Great job! :)
The house reef is another great bonus as the kids could feed the fish and enjoy time playing on the beach. There is also a big kids pool. The kids had a great time there.
And in the morning breakfast, they have unlimited fresh mango -- very yummy!! This can really occupy the kids as they are all mango lovers!!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

This place is perfect for those with kids, as the management really makes it a point to make the resort as kid friendly as possible. Rooms we stayed in are newly refurbished and other rooms still ongoing renovation. We encountered a slight inconvenience one night as we were swimming in the pool and saw sparks and smoke, and smelled chlorine fumes nearby the pool. The lifeguard on duty was the only staff we encountered who did not seem to care and did not know how to handle the situation. However, when we called the attention of management, they were very apologetic and explained the situation. The management knows how to handle their customers well.

My family has been coming here for years and anytime i am in cebu i make it a point to stay here. Pools were great, the one close to the restaurant with the infinity edge was very clean and well maintained. The other pool area with the slide and basketball goal not quite as clean.

pool staff are a standout, setting out your towels, offering dry towels throughout the day, cold towels for your face during the hottest part of the day and ice water throughout the day. they also take food and drink orders from the 4 different bars and restaurants

concierge staff will organise cars or taxis and help you with information about places to go etc
the shuttle to and from the airport is a great bonus and the shuttle to the local shopping centres is also a safe way to go.

the resort is fabulous, but be prepared for very third world conditions in the nearby vicinity. we came in at night and our first trip out of the resort in the day light was quite confronting. there is not much to do in the local area other than the shopping centre SM mall well worth the visit. the tourist desk has one flyer with about 5 tours to mostly local religious monuments,

"An easy get-away from Hong Kong, the Shangri-La was a worthwhile stay. Lots for the kiddos, but we didn't bring ours. Beach was clean, water was crystal clear, though there was some rubbish floating within the roped off area which, without exception, should be cleaned up.

We stayed in a panoramic ocean view room. Views were great, but room and bathroom are in need of updating. A 5 star hotel should have a separate shower/bath, a rain shower and an exhaust fan in the bathroom. Always love the L'Occitane toiletries in the Shangri-La hotels. The bedroom needs some serious freshening up from the dingy curtains to peeling walls but the bed was super comfy.

What we thought was 5 star: the service. Really, they couldn't do enough for us and seldom did anyone accept tips. The spa...western prices but wonderful service. The fish dishes on the menu...incredible ceviche and tuna tartare.

It seems they are renovating a section at a time, so eventually, they may get to the Ocean wing.

Would we stay again? We would bring the kids here. They would love the fish feeding, kayaks and water slides, but there are just too many great beaches close to Hong Kong, so I doubt we would go back.",Comfort & Facilities:Location

The spa is fab-u-lous. Prices for spa treatments and meals are less than I've come to expect in Asia in five star places, to that, too, is a win.

Loved the hotel room, and hotel is not far from the airport. As I am currently living in Asia and making the most of visiting as many places as possible and I have to say that inline with other Shangri La hotels (including Rasa Ria), I do not think you should have to pay high prices per session for the children's club. I also would advise you that drinks etc are very expensive for this part of the world, I do not mind paying higher prices but the prices here are quite frankly a rip off. Breakfast could also be abit of a cattle market and on the last day people had to sit in the restaurant next door as it was too full.",Value for money:Food
"Having spent the first week of our honeymoon in a quiet resort and spa in Boracay, I decided we needed something a little more mainstream for the next week. I had seen a video blog of a visit to this hotel and it seemed to be ideal, so I made the booking based on the strength of the Vlog.
Kat and I took the hotel shuttle from the airport to the resort, and we were impressed by the sheer size of the estate as we drove up the driveway. Some upgrades are being carried out at the moment, so we couldn't see everything and there are some hoardings in place to separate guests and the construction work.
We had a small problem upon arrival, despite being made aware of our flight details and that we arrived around 2:30pm our room was not ready, subsequently there were a few communication breakdowns, but we were able to get to our room by 5pm, having grabbed some lunch and had an opportunity to relax by the pool in the mean time.
The facilities at the resort are excellent, several pools, a kiddie pool with attendants, gym, several shops, a number of bars and restaurants and an exclusive spa. There is also a watersports centre for diving, snorkelling, jetski etc. You could spend your entire time within the resort, leaving only if swimming in the sea as everything you could need is provided.
The rooms are excellent, clean and tidy and a good size with modern TVs and quiet aircon. The hotel operates a shuttle service into Cebu City if you wish to explore or go shopping, which we did on a couple of occasions.
The breakfasts buffet was excellent with plenty of choice from a variety of cuisines and lots of fruit and juices for the more health conscious. The staff were most attentive and helpful if any item ran out.
I have only one complaint, which might seem unfair in such an up-market establishment, but do they really need to charge PHP150 for a beer or a can of Coke, that is equivalent to US$3.5 or GBP2.25?",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My wife and I originally planned to spend three nights here on vacation. My wife was traveling to manila for work then we took a flight to Cebu to spend a few vacation days at the end of her trip. We were having such a great time we forfeited a prepaid night at another hotel and opted to spend an additional night at the Shangri La because it was perfect. The service is outstanding and the location is perfect. There is a fabulous coral reef just off shore you can snorkel at and you just raise your hand when sitting on the beach and someone runs over to get you what you need (drinks, food, more towels). I also want to complement the staff especially the life guards. We witnessed an unfortunate event on the beach in which the life guards rushed into the water to help save a gentleman. Not sure what happened to him or whether he had a heart attack or not, but the staff pulled him to shore and immediately started CPR to save the man. Staff came running to the beach from everywhere to assist and the life guards did CPR the entire time until the ambulance arrived. It was also good to see the had an AED unit close by and actually had to use the device on this person. I do not know the final outcome of the patient but from my experience the crew did everything they could to help him, hopefully he made it. I know this is not a ""cheery"" thing to write about but I thought it was important to note the amazing response from the staff during a very scary situation and the fact they were well trained and ready to deal with this very serious situation. Back to the resort, we had an amazing time, the food was fabulous and we were totally able to relax and unwind while at the resort. I would absolutely recommend the hotel to anyone.",Staff

Very relaxing sitting out in the balcony in the evening. Food from the restaurants was very good. We especially enjoyed going to the Italian restaurant.

We checked in a little after lunch and since our room wasn't ready yet, they gave us a free upgrade to the Ocean Club. When they heard it was our wedding anniversary, they made extra preps in our room and put petals and special towels on the bed and bathroom. The Ocean Club allows you free access to their lounge that offers cocktails and drinks almost all day round. We ate ala carte in Tides since my husband and I are cutting down on our diet, and when one dish took longer than expected to arrive, the waitress gave us a fruit platter compliments of the house. The buffet breakfast was always a highlight with the variety of food they serve, and they kept on refilling the food trays even if it was close to 10am already. Staff was very helpful and friendly.

The wonderful Guest Relations lady (Mechelle) was superb and gave us a full description of the resort, also a card allowing us to explore until they were ready for us. We went to Tea of Spring for our lunch and by the time we finished Mechelle arrived with our keys etc. We had booked an Ocean Club Executive Suite and were upgraded to an Ocean View Suite, on the 6th floor, this was just fabulous with expansive views to Bohol. For 3 days we had breakfast at Tides which is a great experience as the choices are endless also my wife likes the Japanese noodles. On the last day we ate at Ocean Club Lounge, this was superb also but less choices. We went on an Island Hopping tour with Scotty's, although it is not part of Shangri La it is overseen by Shangri La to ensure all their activities are safe and well run. We had lunch on the Island which was Philippine barbecue and was very nice. The next day we went parasailing again with Scotty's. We chose the Magnum preference which is 350 metres of rope, this is an experience never to be forgotten by my granddaughter or myself. On the other days we had lunch at Tea of Spring, the food and service is out of this world. The Peking Duck, whilst not quite as good as Hong Kong, is still a superb meal. In the evening we had cocktails in the Ocean Club lounge along with some canapés. After eating lunch and the canapés, unfortunately, we were unable to try the other restaurants. It is very hard to single out people as they all are just fabulous and we were looked after as though we were family. I will give special mention to the people that looked after us. I have mentioned Mechelle, a wonderful young lady who really put her everything to care for us. The Tea of Spring young ladies Liza and Belle were just great. In the Ocean Club lounge I have to say that Jeanifer was superb. The lounge manager Veronica was wonderful and went out of her way to attend us. Needless to say this is truly a 5 star resort where the service and quality is equal to any Shangri La we have stayed at. The grounds are in beautiful condition and there is always someone working on the gardens. If anyone wants to stay at a resort that has everything then Shangri La Mactan is the place as really there is no need to leave. I would suggest to anyone contemplating a stay to book an Ocean Club room it is well worth the extra cost.",Food:Location
"I just came back from five-night stay at Shangri La Mactan Resort and have to say I was continually amazed at all the attention to detail at the resort. I felt like the management of the resort pretty much read my mind in terms of the service/facilities I would want/need for my family and everything was there ready for us. It really is super kid/baby friendly (e.g., great play room area, water facility with age appropriate pools and slides), staff is very helpful/friendly (they appear immediately with beach towels when you grab a chair on the beach/by the pool), facility is not as luxurious as some of the hotels you will see in South East Asia but clean and reliable.

I would totally go back to this resort every year with other families until my children are old enough to appreciate/handle more adventurous/cultural destinations.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"It is always a pleasure to stay at Shangri-la Mactan. For this stay, we were upgraded to a Panorama Suite, and when they promised a very nice room, the staff meant it. I could never ask for more. The only disappointment was the lack of bidet in the room. But over-all, no other complaints because the whole experience made up for the lack of bidet. If someone loves aqua sports or activities, there are interesting stuff to choose from. Their beach has powdery white sand, with life guards always on the look-out. Food/drinks station is nearby to caters to guests' cravings. There are pools, both for children and adults. There is even a mini golf course for the guests, and a mini chapel for spiritual reflection. One time, I saw an F&B staff scattering/throwing bread crumbs for the birds in a corner, it was a very cute sight. I felt the hotel and staff were working in harmony with nature.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at the Shangri-la for just 3 nights on our way back to HongKong. Location is convenient as it is close to the airport. Beautiful beach with very good service. Rooms are clean and the whole resort is well taken care of. Service is friendly. The Italian Restaurant as well as the Cowrie Cove provided good service and excellent food. Breakfast tended to be very crowded with waiting times between 9 and 10 but the staff did their utmost.
Although there were many families with kids the resort is so big that there is room for everybody. We would not stay there for longer as we usually prefer smaller resorts but we enjoyed our stay.",Food:Location:Staff
"My family and I have been coming to this hotel for the past 5 years as part of our family's yearly getaway from the busy city life. We love staying in the Ocean Wing area due to its nice, quiet and private location vs the main tower wing. I have always enjoyed the hotel and its service and must truly say that the design and layout of the whole hotel is absolutely excellent. However, for this year's trip, there are signs that the hotel seems to be getting ""tired"". The Ocean Wing rooms we were assigned to (2012 and 2022) needs a renovation quick as they look old and beaten up. Cabinet hinges are loose and scratches on cabinets can be seen. The sliding door out to a small terrace takes a lot of effort to open and close. The toilet shower/tub sealant have signs of molding on them. On our first day, We had to request for a new blanket as the one that came with the room smelled bad. This was not good considering we arrived early and were told that the rooms were still being cleaned/prepared for us. The outside eating area of the restaurant, Tides, had an unusually high count of flies that should be controlled.

Service is also not as good as before. We asked for plates to be brought up to our room for a family in room dinner...and ended up eating dinner without plates. Someone kept calling to ask if the plates have already been brought up but they never came.

Staff are still friendly and always have the warm smile and greeting but the service quality level (and not just the character/ personality level) really have to be brought up to a higher standard similar to the previous years.

The beach still looks good and have fishes swimming all over the place. But given the very short beach front, it can get crowded given that the beach is open for use by hotel guests and locals who can pay to use the beach facilities. No too much privacy couples but ok for families.

For what its worth, the pillows and bed still allows a good night's rest.

It would be best to upgrade the rooms and service level fast given the Shangrila name is labelled all over the place. Hopefully, when we visit again in a year's time, the upgrades can be seen.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"My friends and I arrived early and got a room that was quite nice with a view. However, the bathroom door got stuck and couldn't be opened or closed. Housekeeping was called to have this repaired. In the evening after a swim, my friends and I went back to the room to get ready for dinner. I got stuck in the bathroom! It took 5 calls to the front desk to get Houskeeping upstairs to get me out. Therefore, we requested to have a room change. We packed out bags and was assured that our bags will be transferred to the new room. Our key cards were dropped off in the lobby as we proceeded to go, out for dinner. Two hours later we are sitting in the lobby without a room. 30 minutes later we finally moved to our new room. Not as nice and to our horror the view from the balcony was a garden filled with furniture and beds, employees loitering and the parking lot. After having been locked in the bathroom for 30 minutes, management should have done a hell of a lot more than move us to room with this kind of view. This is not on par with Shangri-La's high standard. Management only offered a discount on the room and said that was the best he could do. Seriously, are you kidding me! A guest was locked in the bathroom that was supposedly repaired earlier. Other than management having very poor customer service, the resort was fantastic.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The hotel is located 15 minutes away from the airport. We stayed at the Ocean Wing room which we heard were newer than the main wing. The room & bathroom were spacious and modern with a balcony overlooking the ocean. Buffet breakfast was served at the Italian restaurant downstairs in our Ocean Wing & we could conveniently walk to the hotel's private beach in just a few steps away (the beach is much further away from the main wing so choose Ocean wing if prefer to go to the beach). The hotel has 3 swimming pools which are all near each other (one pool just below our Ocean Wing building). So if you find it too crowded, you can choose to swim at another pool. There are several restaurants in the hotel. We tried the Pizza at the Italian restaurant which was not too bad and served with complimentary bread sticks & various bread. Try going over to the Cowrie's Cove which is half bar half restaurant (it is located by the sea just behind the main swimming pool, next to the sea sports centre). We went there at night & the atmosphere there was romantic with the sea breeze & you must walk the path leading from the bar to the Observatory out towards the sea. It's like a place on your own out there.

We enjoyed the best snorkelling at the beach in front of the hotel (nearest to the big rock facing the beach bar). Go there early in the morning around 8+.or 9+am and ask the hotel staff at the counter near the beach for some complimentary fish food. We notice the fish were usually near the shore around 9+am probably used to people feeding them around that time. We saw so many fishes and had a great time snorkelling there. Tip: snorkel in the morning. You will see more fishes in the morning. We snorkelled at the same area in the afternoon but didn't see much fish. The counter at the beach provides beach towel, life jackets, masks, snorkels and fins for free rental,

Staff at the hotel had one of the best service I've ever seen. They were almost smiling and greeting us whenever they passed by. Especially the staff at the beach. They were really attentive and prompt in their action, for eg. they would quickly rush over to help us by putting new beach towels at the sun chairs for us, and then later help us by taking our towels when we were done and leaving the beach.

There is a shuttle bus provided by the hotel to 2 shopping malls in Cebu city - SM mall & Ayala. Book with the hotel concierge before going. There is a fixed schedule for when the bus would leave the hotel & the shopping mall. Ask the hotel for the bus time table,. We took the bus to SM mall and spent almost a whole day there. SM Mall has a large supermarket, department store and many shops & fast food restaurants there. Journey takes around 45-50 minutes one way to SM mall. Ayala is further but we didn't go there. Need to pay the hotel 300 Philippine Peso per person for a return journey on the shuttle bus. Pay upon check-out.

Overall, we had a great stay here. Will definitely return again one day.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Smile, smile and smile. The staff is so kind, willing to help, support and make your vacation a super warm moment. The hotel is nice and comfortable, choose an ocean view room, it's worth it.
The resort offers 2 or 3 swimming pools: ideal for kids and families but others, like us, can always find a peaceful place. The beach is nicely set, and you will have a fresh salad or a virgin pinacoloda at the beach small cafe.
Spa is great but way too expensive ( as expensive as Japan...).
Overall a nice stay, yet overpriced, it's Philippines, and the enviroment outside the resort is not that unforgettable.
Good to know : if you want to go to Oslob and see the whale sharks, it's a 3 or 4 hours ride away, at high cost.",Value for money:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed at Shangri-La Mactan for 5 days. We had a sea view room which had a spectacular panaramic view of the grounds and coast. The grounds of the hotel are top notch with several pools, towel service in multiple locations, lots of restaurants and lounge areas. The private beach with house reef is especially nice with lots of fish and a variety of things to see. I was a little disappointed to see Crown of Thorns starfish on the house reef. The reef is not large and I would think it wouldn't be too difficult for the staff to check each day and remove those. If they want their reef to improve and last, they'll need to get rid of those.

Location wise, the resort is a LONG ways from any sort of town. It's a 20+ minute cab ride to get to downtown Mactan and if you want to get to Cebu, plan for 45 minutes. While the grounds of the hotel are prestine and beautiful, immediately outside it's the opposite. The poverty is extreme and widespread. It seems to actually get worse the closer to Cebu you get. So that said, the location (a long ways from Cebu) is a good thing.

Likely due to the extreme poverty outside the resort, the security is extreme as well. There is security everywhere and they even check cars entering the resort with mirrors and a bomb sniffing dog. When you walk around the resort, they ask for your room number everywhere. The day we arrived our flight landed early and we got to the resort before our room was ready. So they gave us a little pass card to get around the resort.

Check in is an odd process. It's REALLY slow and they have this sort of wierd cut in line process. So while you are waiting in line, one of the staff will come up and graciously ask what you need (check in, money exchange, etc.). They will then walk up to the front of the line and interrupt someone currently being helped to try and help you...? It's very odd and makes you feel like a jerk. It also makes the whole process much slower.

Food at the resort is very good, but also very expensive. Food outside the hotel is horrid. There are a couple of restaurants at the Marina Mall Mactan. There are also two huge indoor malls in Cebu. Avoid those unless you have a need to visit a huge, multi-level American style mall with terrible food, overpriced shops, and crowds of people. We spent a couple hours in one and left with headaches.

There isn't much shopping in Mactan (or in Cebu outside of one of the nightmare malls). There are a few shops 5 minutes walk from the hotel at ""Liberty Shrine"". They don't have much, but they have T-shirts and a few local wares (real toads turned into purses...?). One funny thing is some of the T-shirt stands make your T-shirt while you wait. They have all the paints and silk screens. You pick out the design and size and they make it right up. We opted for the pre-made shirts thinking they'd likely last through a wash better.

So overall, I would say we really liked Shangri-La Mactan. The staff and everyone we encountered at the resort was friendly and helpful. I don't know that we'll ever go back to the Philippines, but if we visited Cebu again, we would definitely stay at Shangri-La.",Location:Staff:Food
"We visited the Shangri-La over Easter in 2013. We stayed a week at the resort. Overall, we had a great holiday and my six year old son had a blast, which meant that my husband and I managed to relax aswell! Happy kids, happy parents!!
When we arrived on Good Friday it was very busy at the resort and over the Easter weekend it was a bit too crowded and crazy trying to get a place at the pool or in the restaurants. But there was a Easter egg hunt, magicians, acrobats etc for the kids so they had fun despite the crowds. However, on the Monday after Easter it was great as it was a lot quieter. The resort has two pools - one with a kids slide which my son loved and also a shaded wet play area for younger children - mini golf, table tennis, pool tables, basketball hoops (in the pool), an indoor play area where the kids could also do craft activities, an small arcade room, air hockey, foosball etc it was great. There was so much to do that my son was constantly busy and playing with his new friends and having fun. There were also movie nights arranged in the evening for the kids where they would be given dinner, watch a movie and then play in the indoor play area until picked up so perfect for parents to escape and have a quiet dinner together.
The pool area is nicely spaced with lots of shaded and grass areas which is great especially with kids.
The beach was also very good as sandy and barely any rocks. There is a marine reserve just off the beach that everyone can snorkel in and we saw blue starfish and parrot fish to name a few - it is a great introduction for children to snorkeling. There were also small tented areas and shade to keep out of the sun and lots of watersports!
The food at the resort was of a good standard and we were pretty impressed with the general consistency, choice and level of cooking. The staff were great - everyone was so friendly from the gardeners and cleaners all the way up to the managers and nothing was too much trouble at all.
We stayed in a club room so had access to the club lounge which was great as you could have a relaxed breakfast, soft drinks all day and then the cocktails and canapes in the evening which were great. Worth it if you want to do that.
I would definitely recommend this hotel if you have kids and you want a beachy holiday where you also get to relax. As I mentioned before, happy kids, happy parents!! :-)",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We booked an executive suite and got upgraded to a 1br suite with a panoramic view coz it took a while before they could have our room ready. But let me tell you, it was worth the wait!

In the bedroom, it had one queen size bed, big bathroom with separate toilet and bath and tub. There's a living area with a sofa bed (fits 2). You can also request for a roll-in bed for an extra person, and a playpen could also be requested to be put inside the room.
A 4 person dining table is also available. Coffee espresso machine available which is great!

Everyone is so kind to all of the children and respectful to guests (even the embarassingly rude ones). We have been there twice and I wish we had time to go back before we leave The PI.
The only thing and truly the ONLY thing about Shangri-La Resorts is that their spa prices are outrageous. Truly higher than any 5 star resort we've stayed in and I'm not sure what they could possibly do to warrant these prices. Considering they have the FANTASTIC Kids Club, it's exactly the kind of thing one would want to run, not walk to- but I just couldn't bring myself to pay these prices. The spa is what made me rank value as ""very good"", not ""excellent"".",Value for money:Staff

Can use a stroller in resort was nice and spacious had nice grounds, covered childrens pool, lots of activities, beautiful beach so clean and lovely clear waters.

Food was just Ok, but the fact that it was easy with two young children was perfect for us, for quick to get to door to door from HK worked out perfect

"What can I say that's bad about this resort - Absolutely nothing!

I had the wonderful priviledge of staying at the Shangri-la Mactan for two days, twice, on the bookends of a recent trip to Cebu/Bohol. If you're comparing or thinking of any hotel on Cebu/Mactan, think no further than the Shangri-la. It's a short 15 minute drive from the Mactan airport to the resort so it's the perfect place to stay when either landing into or flying out of the Cebu airport. I definately wouldn't want to fight traffic just before or after a long flight in favor of a hotel in Cebu City. The Shanghri-la avoids those complications.

From the minute you arrive, all the staff are wonderful - warm, friendly, always ready with a smile or willingness to do anything within their powers to make your stay wonderful. You need a quick housekeeping or turndown, no problem. Want 8 bottles of extra drink water, no problem, Move that beach cabana from this area to the next, please let us do that! Although I guess you pay a bit for the pleasure of staying here, I was never treated as well than I was at the Shangri-la.

Even though I'm not the Spa type of person, if you stay here or are even just in Cebu, you must try the Chi Spa. The biggest of all the Shangri-la properties, this is a totally decedant experience. Take advantage of their recommendation to arrive an hour before your treatment and endulge in the whole experience. Jacuzzi pool, steam bath, sauna, shower, plunge pool, all this is for your personal use. Then the actual spa treatments are just the right thing to soothe your tired body and regenerate your energies. Pure bliss.

I'm still in wonderment over how perfect the resort is. Yes, they cater to families and kids, but those without will equally enjoy a terrific vacation. Where else can you lie on a cabana on the beach staring out at the torquoise blue Mactan straight? Feeling a little hot, put on your sorkel mask and swim out a few feet from shore into the most wonderful tropical fish aquarium you could possibly imagine. You usually have to take boat out a bit to see such rich and color marine life, but this is right off shore! A now feeling a little hungry? The Breeze restaurant down on the beach has one of the best hamburgers I've ever eaten.

The Cowrie Cove is a perfect place for a romantic dinner with the one(s) you love, but do call early for a reservations if you want a table outdoors and along the railing. The best place to dine on Mactan. And for breakfast, chose the Acqua restaurant buffet in the Ocean Wing rather than the Tides. The Acqua is much less crowded and the food is essentially the same. A much better total experience.

I must thank Jerome, one of the Concierge staff, who ensured my girlfriend would be delivered safely to the airport at 3AM. The first hotel shuttle didn't leave until 3:30AM, a bit of a stretch for her 4:15AM flight to Manila. Although others tried to push the expensive 800 pHp Avis car rental, Jerome took the initative to take action to resolve our dilemma. After a nice dinner, I arrive back to my room to find a nice note from Jerome saying a car would be waiting to make the trip to the airport the next morning, entirely complementary by the resort. Customer service at it's finest!

Finally, I had an error on my billing after I left and worried it would tie up my card limit. But a quick call to the front desk followed by regular email status updates resolved the problem quickly and efficiently.

All in all, if you want carefree luxury, you need to know only two words: Shangri-la Mactan.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Heard so much about this resort I decided to book my first visit using my Asia Miles reward. Upon arrival, it was as I expected. The lobby was grand and the greeters welcoming. However, when I reached my non smoking accommodation the room was so stuffy. There was no way it was a non smoking room. I wanted to switch room but all they could offer was a chemical spray. I declined. Am allergic to aerosoles. Later I headed down to Tides for light lunch. Ordered a small salad for around 500.00 pesos and a calamansi juice. To my surprise the juice itself cost me 310.00 pesos for a small glass. Definitely outrageous as the price was not listed in the menu. The waiter was apologetic. He said there was nothing he could do about it.The following morning we headed to Tides for a complimentary breakfast buffet. The hostess decided to bill us as soon as we got seated and insisted the front desk will credit us upon check out. I questioned the necessity of that but they did not relent. While everyone else breezed in and out of breakfast, I was served a bill on my table before I finished breakfast. All these made me wonder if I was truly an unwelcome guest from the very time I arrived. I was greatly offended not to mention insulted. Upon checkout I had to explained myself again and again why I refused to pay for the breakfast as they decided not to include that in the package either. Clearly it was included in the package and I made sure of that before I booked. My first visit to Shangri La and how disappointing! Will definitely stay away from this resort and decided not to book any family members with them either.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"Shangri-la Mactan had been our favorite weekend get away for the past 6 years and it has never failed to impress. The property, rooms, amenities and most specially the people are all top notch. For this trip, we decided to splurge a little and stayed at a family deluxe room located at the ocean wing. The splurging was well worth it, the room had 2 queen size beds and a sofa that converts into a bed as well, we were also given 4 bottles of complimentary water every day instead of 2 and the toiletries provided are all by L'occitane. The only downside of this room is perhaps it is located on the ground and we have the view of the drop off area of the ocean wing but no complaints because we were very comfortable inside our room.

All the staff of Shangri-la Mactan were very courteous and they will always greet you good morning or afternoon whatever time it may be. The lobby staff of the ocean wing were great, they were always there to assist us with our needs from safe keeping of ice packs to a request of late check out. When we arrived, our room was not yet ready and they provided a function room where guest can wait. As soon as our rooms were cleaned they called up my phone to tell us that we can proceed to the lobby to get our keys to the room. The restaurant staff of all their outlets are also to be commended. They were very attentive to our needs and will ask if there other things that we need.

I can't find anything of fault to this property, it just keeps getting better every time we come here and for sure we will have our yearly weekend summer get away at Shangri-la Mactan",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"This was our fifth or sixth stay at Shangri La Mactan, our family's go-to hotel for Cebu. As usual, we stayed in the Ocean Club rooms in the Ocean Wing because why pay so much to go to Shang to just have a view of the parking lot? Waking up to the sea breeze is so much better than waking up to exhaust fumes.

As usual, the beach was perfect. White sand, clear water, and the most beautiful coral sanctuary! I spent so much time snorkelling/skin diving that I ripped one of my fins. Though it may have been too old anyway. The beach staff were also on hand to give us towels and water. What was irritating though was that there were so many beach chairs ""reserved"" by towels with their owners nowhere in sight! Politeness dictates these are claimed and can't be used, but seriously people, if you claim a chair please use it? Also, Shang seemed to have fewer kayaks now than the last time we were here in 2011 (only one 'one person' kayak?) but no biggie, the two-person kayaks were good for singles as well.

What I loved the most about our stay was the lovely staff. They obviously love their jobs and they're very people-oriented. In particular, one breakfast, the Acqua omelet station chef, remembered that I had asked when the siomai would be done (he said 15-20 minutes, it was still being steamed) and personally brought the siomai to our table when it came out later. That morning, the restaurant was pretty full, and the omelet station always busy, so I really appreciated that. In addition, every day after cleaning our room, our very happy room attendant would position our books and stuffed animals in such strange arrangements. As we checked out earlier today, he ran into us and kindly asked if we had all of them with us. Yes, travel with our stuffed animals. We're like children like that, and we very, very much appreciated the care of Shangri-La Mactan's staff. (If the General Manager is reading this, please do convey our thanks!)

Well, we spent a week there and oh how lovely was it. I also made my usual Chi spa trip for a Chi Polish and Hilot on our last full day, which was yesterday. Criselda, my therapist, has the best hilot hands in the entire country. Surprisingly there were no others at the spa, so I had the sauna, steam room, and massage pool to myself!

The only thing I was mildly disappointed with this stay was the lack of longganisa or tocino. There was no longganisa or tocino at all in the buffets at Acqua, Tides, or the 8th floor! Yes, I know there's room service, but as a Philippine-based hotel, I would have liked more Philippine food in the buffet both to cater to local taste as well as to introduce the many, many foreign visitors to our food.

Nonetheless, I truly love Shangri La Mactan and as always, we'll be back soon.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"A large, beautifully designed lobby opens onto a magnificent ocean vista. When checking in we were presented with a glass of chilled fruit juice and were then brought in person to our floor by one of the many staff on hand. Personal service is obviously a priority at the hotel and we were constantly greeted by passing staff with a friendly smile and a ""Good morning"".

The facilities are very good at Shangri-La with several swimming pools available. For me, taking a dip in the sea was much more enjoyable with warm water and lots of fish swimming around you in very shallow water. Kayaking, snorkelling and other water sports are also readily available.

The rooms are really lovely. I stayed for two nights and for the first had a lovely ocean view that was bright and spacious with a particularly good bathroom.

There are two restaurants at Shangri-La and we ate breakfast in Tides. It was truly delicious with a wide range of dishes on offer, some prepared by chefs at their stations in front of you.

I dealt with the staff at Shangri-La for over almost a year as I had my wedding at the hotel.

"Me and my husband got married in the Shangri-La in November 2012 - it was the best experience of our lives and was largely due to the great service at the Shangri-La. All our guests couldn't stop raving about the hotel and me and my husband find ourselves constantly comparing other hotels in other countries to the Shangri-La in Cebu. Not many can match up to the level of service we received! Every staff member is friendly and courteous! Everyone from the receptionist to the gardener will greet you with a smile as you pass by. Our wedding coordinator at the hotel (Maureen Rendon) was very helpful, and exceedingly patient. She went out of her way to help make the experience extra special, i.e. giving us an extra night for free in the bridal suite, adding rose petals to the wedding aisle taken from the hotel's own flowers to add an extra pop of colour, etc. It was all perfect. We had an event in the Buko bar and the ocean pavilion, and got married on the beach at night and had the reception in the Mactan ballroom. Each venue was great and the food was awesome.
In terms of the hotel itself, the beach is beautiful and the water is so clear, with fish coming right up to you. The rooms are comfortable and clean, and the breakfast buffets are tasty.
There's also a spa near the hotel, which was actually recommended by the hotel staff, and is really good and very cheap!

While there is plenty to do in the area, first time visitors who are not accustomed to the Philippine's poverty, crowded streets and horrible drivers might just find that they never even need leave the confines of this awesome establishment. And best of all its a mere 10-minute drive from the airport off of peak hours.

Staff are highly competent, professional, helpful and friendly. Food selection in the variety of restaurants on the premises are just awesome! -yeah, its all Singapore prices... but a slap on the wrist if all you really want is convenience and relaxation.

The hotel can arrange local tours of course, and I would highly recommend: whale-shark watching, diving in Moal-Boal, and perhaps some nearby island hopping.",Location:Food:Staff
"It was our third time to stay at Shangri-La Mactan. Went in 2002, 2011 then January 2013. Always a pleasure to stay at Shang Mactan. Check-in and check-out is a breeze at the Ocean Wing. Generous breakfast. Newer rooms. Nice pools and well-maintained marine sanctuary. Kid Zone is for children 4 years and older. The Toddler Zone can get pretty crowded as it is small. Meals at the food outlets are expensive and not as good as the breakfast buffet. Service is superb. Staff is friendly.",Food:Staff
"I lived in Cebu for 6 years (I am a 11 years old). My parents took me alot (But I didnt always stay for the night, I just visited for the day) and it is amazing! The beach is beautiful, you are allowed to feed the fish. Me and my Best Friend used to go there like every 2 months with our families. You can pick out life jackets and, if you fancy an adventure, you can kayak and/or go on a Jetski!!! The oceans are safe and the most dangerous animal you can find is ether a sea urchin or a lion fish (Lion fish is extremely rare and can only be found in the deep water). There are tons of different types of fish dotted all ove the sea. Its spectacular! If you want, you can kayak over to a wooden platform away from shore, and you can jump off it! Also you can often see jumping fish in little schools jumping over from the middle of the ocean.

The rooms are beautiful. Most of them have balconies, which usually over-look the sea. Its cool because most of the hallways are open, not rooms, they have rails on the side so you can look into a mini garden. There are a few roomed-hallways, which has red carpeting.

Food: The best restsaurant by far was the main buffet (I apologise, I dont recall the name). It had a variety of different cultures (food) and had indoor seatings as well as out door.

There is an adventure zone for children up to 13 I think... It has a firemans pole and a side into a ball pit. Also includes 3 floors of diffrent adenturous activities! including a rope based bridge with wooden planks to step on, four ropes ""Vines"" to swing on to get across ""lava"" (Matty-thingie) plus many more (I know from experience!!)! Also there is a game room with a pool table, fooz-ball table, arcade games, and much, much more.

Shangrila Mactan has many more wonderful features. If you want a) a resort b)excellent service c)Wonderful food+rooms d)Lots of activities plus many more, Shangrila Mactan is your best choice. The only problem is that its quite a drive from the main city, but if you stay there for a few days, you wouldnt need to leave the hotel. I now live in Dubai and last visited it there 2 years ago. I must say that it has not in any way disapointed me, if anything its improved!

Note: I didnt visit in April 2012, its just that it didnt say "" July 2011""!",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This is probably one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in! It is certainly quite dear per night but well worth it.

The rooms are spacious with a huge bathroom. Although they are a dated in terms of decor it is still very comfortable to stay in. Rooms are clean and well looked after. You do of course receive free complimentary bottles of water. The beds were large and soft and the A/C very quiet. Our room had a little balcony overlooking the edge of the swimming pool. It was nice to relax outside but the resort itself is beautiful so didn't spend a lot of time on our balcony.

As for the resort itself, well, it's stunning! There's a lot of garden areas and they have a large spa area called the Chi Spa which is beautiful and relaxing. Although I didn't get any treatments there I did look inside and I can only imagine how relaxing having a massage or treatment there would be!

The resort has their own private beach area which is lovely. They have a pagoda overlooking the sea with lots of loungers on the beach itself. They offer a wide range of water activities and we took up the jet skis which was quite expensive for the hour but worth it all the same. I did take a look at the neighbouring Hilton hotel and their beach wasn't nearly half as good as the Shangri-La's. The hotel also has an infinity pool which overlooks the beach.

The reception area is extremely large and very luxurious. There's plenty of places and space to walk around without feeling enclosed in any way. The staff at reception are very welcoming and polite. There are a couple of bars and restaurants dotted around the hotel. Our package had complimentary buffet breakfast and the selection was exceptional! A lot of different nationalities of food available and all fresh.

The only problem I had with this hotel is that it's quite far away from the city. You will need to take the shuttle bus. If you stay in the hotel you end up eating in the hotel which is quite expensive and dinner served in their restaurants wasn't as good as their breakfast! There are some restaurants at the entrance to the resort which you can walk to. But although they were cheap you get what you pay for, to put it politely.

Overall a fantastic hotel with large beautiful open grounds and excellent private beach. Staff were all courteous and friendly. Great selection for their buffet breakfast and good choices of water activities available. I would recommend a stay for only a few nights as Cebu has so much to offer than just the resort.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I stay on this hotel for business trip. overall I am very pleased with the service.
the room is very comfortable and clean.
food quality is good, but I would like to recommend the Chinese restaurant inside the hotel. they provide a good food and very good services.
the staff are very nice, there are even dedicated staff for foreign languages (such as Korean) standby in the reception area - I don't know if they still have it or not, but that's what I have last time I stay on the hotel.
The hotel is outside of the city, but there is shuttle bus from the hotel to some shopping mall in the city. I cannot remember if it is free of charge or not, but I think I paid some money for the shuttle services (return).",Staff:Food
"This is a beautiful resort with everything you need for a truly relaxing experience. The resort is like a city in itself with all the amenities you can think of while in vacation. You can just let your cares melt away and let yourself be rejuvenated. From the moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted with welcoming smiles and helpful hands. The huge flower arrangements are replaced daily, a feast for the eyes. The rooms are comfortable, as are the and beds. The buffet dining option is extensive with different restaurant choices which cater to guests from all around the world. The nightlife is fun for the younger set, too. It is very family friendly, but couples can find romantic little nooks, too. They offer sporting options such as parasailing, snorkeling, diving, fishing, etc. The Chi Spa offers an array of services. A three day stay seems short. I'd opt for at least five days to really enjoy this resort.
Noteworthy: Excellent service from all the staff members!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"My husband and I stayed here for four days at the end of a trip to HK and the Philippines and stayed at a Shangri-La in both places. Mactan Island was a lovely place to end our holiday and because we had upgraded to an Ocean Club room, we enjoyed the perks of doing so, i.e. check-in done in our room, access to the Ocean Lounge, etc etc.

Our visit coincided with a weekend when the place was packed with locals and a large (and I mean LARGE) contingent on a company jolly, but apart from the fact that there were an awful lot of over-indulged children present, we had no problem getting loungers on the beach or service in the beach restaurant at lunchtime. There was plenty of beach equipment i.e. fins and snorkels, life jackets, pedalos, kayaks etc. to go round.

As Westerners and Europeans, we were vastly outnumbered by the locals and cultural differences were often quite evident, particularly in the field of manners..... We found it strange that some of the other guests virtually parked themselves on our sunloungers whilst we were sitting on them and thought nothing of invading our private space, but that obviously is no reflection on the hotel, just an observation for the uninitiated!

We did not eat in the main restaurant as it was catering (albeit upmarket) for the masses, but ate instead at Acqua and Tides, where the food was excellent and where the menus offered a wide selection of international cuisine, cooked as it should be. Food is always subjective, and you take as you find, but we had no complaints but if we had to be picky, I would say that the stunning breakfast at the Shangri-La in Bangkok should be held up as an example to all the hotels in the chain of how it should be done.

We had no problems with service but then we treated the staff with respect, unlike many of the other guests we saw who appeared to think themselves better than others. Again, maybe cultural differences ......

Only by comparing it to other Shangri-La hotels we have stayed in are we able to say that in our experience we felt our Ocean Club room was a just a bit dated and tired, particularly for the money we were charged. Having said that, everything was spotlessly clean as were all the facilities in the hotel.

I treated myself to a treatment at the Chi Spa, and have to say that it was absolute heaven. And expensive. But worth it! It was the most beautiful surroundings I've ever experienced in a spa and I would loved to have had time to make more use of it. Maybe another time...... The fitness centre is excellent, has a huge range of equipment and boasts what must be surely the best views of any fitness centre in the world, as the floor to ceiling windows overlook the beautiful hotel gardens.

All in all, a great stay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Easy accessible, nice resort (spacious and clean), excellent service, perfect beach and great choise of restaurants for breakfast buffet, lunch and dinner (buffet) as well.

We went there over CNY which means it is very, very crowded and also with a lot of kids. So keep that in mind when planning your trip. When looking for a place for family holiday it is great. We visited as a young couple/no kids, but nonetheless great holiday.",Food:Location
"Visited this lovely hotel with my 2 kids - age 2 and 7. It was almost perfect for families with young children. Lots of facilites and activities : lots of pools, water slides, swings, water play and an indoor playground. What stands out the most is that snorkelling is right at your door step! Elder kid and I were snorkelling and feeding fish everyday. If you are in other resorts in S.E.A region, you may need a boat ride to do all these, but not here. There's even a PADI dive school in the hotel for those who are into serious diving. Another thing worth mentioning is their service. Even my 7-year old commented that staffs here are alot friendlier than in Shangri-La Golden Sands in Penang!
Food-wise, rather standard fare but lots of Korean selection (probably due the number of Korean guests here). On the 3rd day, we are quite sick of it. Lack of chinese food.
However, do note that besides the hotel, there is really much to offer in Cebu. Well, maybe it's not a fair comment, but as a S'porean, I do need some retail therapy in the evenings but was disappointed. Nearest decent mall takes a while to get there cos of the traffic. Hotel offers free transport to these malls (but dont bother!). I would only rate 3-stars for this Cebu holiday but definitely 5-stars for the hotel. Thank you Shangri-la Mactan!",Location:Food:Value for money
"Excellent all-around. A very comprehensive large resort with mutliple pools and restaurants to keep guests occupied. Stayed for over a week but never got bored. Beach, pool, restaurants were fantastic. Only gripe would be the sheer popularity of the place, so hunting for a good shaded spot by the pool can be a challenge, as is finding the best spot at the restaurants. In connection with this is the lack of personal-level service found at other 5-star resorts. The neighboring Crimson resort, in comparison, was able to provide this, although to be fair, the Crimson resort is smaller. Another gripe was the frequency with which the card-key stopped working. A rather bothersome issue. In any case, an excellent place for North East Asia guests to escape the winter. Scores high points in all categories.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This is our 2nd visit to Shangri-la. The 1st being March 2012.

We booked a 10 night stay with the intention of ""checking out"" another hotel for a further 5 nights. However, upon arrival and over the following days members of staff just kept saying ""welcome back."" We began to realise just how much we enjoyed our previous stay so much so that we extended our stay here for a further 5 nights and decided to forget about the other hotel.

We took breakfast and evening meals at Tides restaurant and the selection of food on offer was excellent. Chef June not only catered for my dietary requirements but also prepared some fantastic traditional filipino food for me to try while Benedicto and Limuel made sure our every need was attended to.

Looking at some of the negative comments here on Tripadvisor I have to say that is certainly NOT what we experienced on either visit. Literally every member of staff we encounted was so poilte, respectful and sincere. The staff here genuinely want you to have the best possible holiday and they are so passionate about there work that NOTHING is too much trouble for them.

We also tried out the Chi Spa this time. OMG! It was the best massage (Philippine Hilot) I have ever had but let me tell you this, the cost P2400 each (promo) was a bargain just to see inside the actual place - you get your own villa!!

I have fallen in love with the Philippines and its people. They have one asset which sticks out like a sore thumb and something which is heading for extinction at an alarming rate in the UK and that is ""Self Respect"" With self respect comes respect for others. On my 1st visit I was walking through a park and a group of 14-16 year old school girls were walking towards me all with beaming smiles on their faces when one of them said ""welcome to our country sir, we hope you enjoy your vacation."" That blew me away! If you looked at a group of similar girls in the UK the best you could expect would be a mouthful of obscenities.

At the pedestrian entrance to the hotel there is a sign which reads ""Thru this pathway pass the most courteous, sincere, respectful and helpful hotel employees in the world."" Let me tell you this.......every word of it is true! These really are the best of the best!

Here's some tips for those people who have left negative comments on Trip Advisor in the hope that they might have a better holiday next time whether staying at the Shangri-la or any other hotel....

If you're the sort of person who:-

1) expects perefection..... start by looking in the mirror. You're not perfect yourself and never will be so don't expect others to be perfect.

2) is looking for total peace and quiet..... go find an uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean and stay there.

3) considers themself to be superior to others..... try dealing with people on an equal basis for a change and you'll be amazed at the results.

4) is impossible to please no matter how hard people try..... either get a life or do everyone else a favour because you're wasting precious oxygen!",Staff:Food:Value for money

The breakfast buffet menu has sufficient choices and we really could enjoy those with nice atmosphere. The most impressive experience here is its private beach. The beach itself is not so large but water is shallow and current is mild. And there are lot of tropical fishes gathering by feeding, might be good for kids. In addition, there are some marine sports available, and even kid's favorite air ball floating over the sea. Life jacket is also available for all hotel guests.

"this is at least my 10th visit, i love coming back to cebu shang. Stayed 3 short nights between Feb 6-9. The caprese salad at Aqua is the best ever, i always ask for chef Grace and she would always prepare it with extra arugula, tomatoes. The pesto and balsamic reduction is super !
The service in this hotel is always top notch. However, i will finally complain about a few annoying issues:

1-i stayed at an ocean view room and paid about P 12000/ night, yet they still have to charge you for snorkeling mask, not to mention that all their masks are all so old from overuse.

2-i remember the last year, the beach shoes were free. during this trip, even this now has a charge, and again, they are all so old from overuse.

3-one afternoon, we brought a room towel with us and walked out of the exit. The security guard stopped us and insisted that we leave the towel ( hotel policy ), however, everytime we take a taxi
from the hotel, there is no check whatsoever at the entrance for stuff that the guests bring out of the hotel.

4-upon checkout, i noticed that the hotel charged me for the airport shuttle bus transfer. I dont ever recall paying for this under the assumption that my room rate was inclusive of this service.
When i told the cashier that i was not paying for that charge, she immediately said she will remove it from the bill, so i dont understand why the hotel had to charge me in the first place

"I stayed at this resort hotel during the weekend ( Feb 15-17, 2013 ) for 2 nights. I wanted a weekend getaway and opted to revisit this place ( i.e. the first time I saw this place was during the mid 90's ). During my first visit wayback then I already fell in love with this place. When I arrived at the hotel, there was an Indian wedding going on ( for 4 days ) hence the hotel was fully booked. I thought the place would be very crowded but realized after all that the place is so big, you can still have your own private moments away from the madding crowd. The room I got was on the 6th floor, garden wing. It wasn't renovated yet ( as the TV is still the hunchback type ) but well maintained. Being an Inner Circle member, I got my daily dose of fresh fruits. Service is reactive yet commendable. Almost everyone I met greeted me with a smile. Also, if you need something, they aim to accomodate you if they can. There were 4 major restaurants and 6 other lounge / drinking places. The breakfast buffet at Tides was adequate. Dimsum during lunch at Tea of Spring was lovely. I enjoyed a dip at the Ocean wing swimming pool. Lastly, I enjoyed hanging out at the spa inside the fitness centre. I even tried the Powerbreak massage ( in which your whole body is submerged in the jacuzzi while your head, face and upper body is being massaged ) which was relaxing and invigorating. One thing though I would suggest is that they should not charge a fee for the shuttle from the airport to the hotel and vice versa considering that other 5 star hotels offer this as a free service. Other than that, everything seemed perfect to me.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We stayed here for 5 nights over the Chinese New Year period, with kids aged 8 and 10. We loved it and had a fantastic time! It was peak seaon and was very busy, but this did not impact the friendly and helpful service from the staff; they always tried to help even on the beach to find seats. Facilities for kids are fantastic, from snorkelling off the beach to pools to indoor playground. Awesome. We took the holiday package which gave us unlimited non-motorised watersports and buffet dinner each night at Tides restaurant for less than SGD100 additional per night. Great value and love the water sports.

Couple of tips for travellers:
- rooms are very clean and all amenities you would expect, but they are dated. Apparently they are all being refurbished from April so that should improve (it didn't distract from the holiday, but just letting you know).
- the expeditions from Scotty's Tours are very EXPENSIVE! We have been to Cebu before so I found a tour guide at the Korean restuarant outside the hotel gate. We hired our own boat for the day at about 30% of the cost for us all to book a trip with Scottys, and were collected and dropped back at the hotel lobby. Yes, you have a short trip to the local wharf, a ""strange"" transfer from the wharf to your boat and you have to pay your own entrance fees, tips and lunches to the islands, but we saved about SGD400 doing it this way.

Overall fantastic and we are planning a return trip next year!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"Stayed here for a week over CNY with my family of 3 children (aged 4, 3 and 4 months). We stayed in a garden view room on the 7th floor. The view out of the room was over looking the entrance and had partial sea views. To be honest I can not see the point in paying more for a sea view as you would be over looking the pool area as well. We didn't spend that much time in the room so it was perfect for us. The hotel is AMAZING for familes. We used the baby sitting service both in the day and at night (300 pesos per hour). We even had a sitter come with us on a boat trip- AWESOME!!! The holiday here was so easy because of this service. It meant we could have adult time, snorkelling, bathing etc without having to be focusing on the children the whole time. The older children loved the adventure zone and went in there most days. Children aged 4 and over can go in unsupervised. The staff are all so friendly and attentive. They pay close attention to detail. The weather was changeable during the week and we had a lot of rain. This did not spoil the trip as you could still sit at the beach under a cabana. The snorkelling just off the beach was SUPER and we saw Nemo 3 times!! I have snorkelled in lots of places and this was the easiest and excellent 'quality'. Get down early to reserve a bed as by 7:30am most sun beds were taken!!! The breakfast at Tides was great and had a huge selection. Was rather busy but that is because it was a holiday week. The dinner at Tides was also great. LOVED the fresh mango!!! I was not so impressed with the food at Cowrie Cove or the Buko special dinner. My children and I were sick after the Buko dinner. The entertainment at the dinner was great, but I was not impressed by the food at all. Stay safe and eat at Tides in the evening. Evening drinks at Cowrie Cove were good though. We went on a morning trip organised by Scotty's Tours to another island to snorkel. This was great and we saw even more fish. If you are not a good swimmer I would not recommend as the current was very strong and it was hard going. Not suitable for young children. The children's slides ere a winner. My older 2 loved the bigger water slide. The slides at the Kota Kinabalu Tanjung were better than the smaller slides here. They were a bit too small for kids aged 4 and above. Still excellent water area though.
Over I have to say it was the easiest holiday with small children. We all LOVED every day. Despite the rain and the food poisoning!!! We WILL come back there. I am already planning our next trip to this family paradise for next year. I would avoid major holidays though to avoid the very busy crowds and not so good weather.

"This hotel is by far the BEST property I've ever stayed at. We upgraded to the Ocean tower so that we could get a beach & pool view. Also, we got access to the ocean club which gave us snacks all day long and cocktail hour from 5:00-7:00pm along with some canapes. Daily breakfast was included with our package. The food was fantastic and the service was even better. I was craving cuchinta - A filipino rice cake. I asked the chef if they had it and he said ""sorry ma'am, we don't have any"" Within 10 mins he came to my table and handed me a plate of cuchinta. I was impressed that he even remember what I looked like.
They do have a shuttle that takes you into the city. If you are comfortable with taking a taxi and have more than 3 people in your party, it is cheaper to take a taxi.
They have everything from minigolf, to a full on golf course. Jet ski, tennis, numerous pools, a gym, games room, ping pong, WiFi all over including the beach area and the list of amenities goes on an on.

Stayed in a renovated the luxe seaside room, bed is pretty good, the room is slightly outdated in some area's but overall clean and well kept. there are several restaurants on the grounds, including two that also serve a breakfast buffet. From Cebu airport it is only a 15 car drive to the hotel, opted for a hotel car.

The staff are great, the food is excellent and for a resort not too outrageously priced. When you check in they offer you a full inclusive package, i declined this as I don't like buffet dinning but for couples traveling with children that could be a good option (it is a great place for children for sure).

I will most certainly go back again.",Food
"Was expecting a more exclusive place in Shang, but disappointed by the sheer number of kids and families. This is especially true at the swimming pool area.

Was appalled by the service level of a security staff dressed in yellow when she approached us in the garden walking towards the pool, asking whether we were guest! I have a feeling that the security staff were out-sourced vendors of the hotel, and did not posses the service level nor the command of the English language to converse properly - what a shame that marred the image of this highly rated hotel in the Mactan area.

At the lobby cafe, where we had our tea break, the waitress's service was cordially, but the service standards were not comparable to those Shangrila in other countries e.g. Singapore. Glasses were misaligned on the coaster, bills were given to a wrong table etc. It's such small details that define a high-class and refined experience.

Would I come back again, I don't think so, at least for the price of the place, I had expected more. Maybe I would go to Bali instead. This is not a bad place, but neither is it an outstanding place expected of the Shang hospitality; it does not have a soul.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"A few days before our wedding at the Shangri La, we stayed in the Panorama Suite overlooking the ocean. The club rooms have their own building and lobby which made it very exclusive and convenient. The room was average, food was good at the club room. The breakfast was great at Tides/Tea of Spring. The hotel has so many facilities and activities to offer. We went jet-skiing and snorkelling. It was amazing to see so many fishes while swimming in the beach. They got 2 or more BIG pools, you can also golf/mini golf near the helipad area. The days before our wedding were fun and relaxing at the same time.

We had our wedding ceremony at the Ocean Pavilion and the reception in Mactan Ballroom. The best person to contact when it comes to wedding is Lea of Shangri La events. Everyone enjoyed the wedding, with such varieties of good food, we also did a helicopter ride around shangri-la on our wedding day, and if you want to do it during your trip just ask anyone from reception and they will give you packages.

Walk around Shangri La daytime for photo-taking. Walk around Shangri La night time as well, since it is very soothing. Go somewhere near the ocean pavilion and the chi spa, go near the beach there is a deck there as well and at night time it is very romantic to walk around before going to sleep. Never forget to go swimming in the beach and go snorkelling and head to those ""platforms on the water"" it is totally fun. Try all the pools and facilities they have.

Overall, we never regretted staying at the Shangri-La. It was awesome. Even choosing it as venue for our special day was an excellent choice. It is definitely the best place to tie the knot or as a venue for your reception. Wedding guests will sure love it as well.

One thing though, Shangri La Mactan rooms are small and old. So if you are looking for a hotel with a good and updated room, and you wont be spending much time enjoying their facilities, then dont go to this hotel. But if you are in for a fun but relaxing trip with partner, family, kids, and friends, and you have a lot of time to enjoy their facilities, then choose Shangri La, it will be definitely be worth it!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I was prepping for my birthday celebration, en route to Hongkong, but decided to stay home and look for a nice (the word is underrated!) and exclusive resort where I can relax and spoil myself. Why not try Shangri-La’s Mactan in Cebu? Why, indeed?. Upon arriving at Mactan Airport, i looked for the Shangri-La booth and the person manning their small booth offered me water (boy, i was so thirsty and he just did the right thing) took my hotel voucher and immediately called the shuttle driver. After 2 minutes, i was on my way to the resort. That was fast! A mere 10-15minutes from the airport and everything was so smoothly done; my check-in was done 4mins after I arrived. The hotel is exclusively nestled in a private property that it felt intimidating yet so relaxed! The lobby reminds me of the Manila Hotel lobby but i would say less imposing and very colonial with a modern touch. I was sheltered on the 9th floor (the main wing i supposed), the room was huge with my own veranda overlooking the other side of Mactan with the imposing view of a residential building and magnificent greeneries! My room was refurbished with best shower and tub evah! Deepsoaking! Fresh towels and toilet amenities were delivered and changed every morning that even made my day fabulous (honestly, im a sucker for five-star hotels toilet amenities!). The food was delectable i gained 4 pounds upon check out! (So true!) The buffet setting at TIDES was divine! I personally love the food selections! They surprised me with a birthday cake and the crew sang ""Happy Birthday"", personally i was teary-eyed and can’t thank them enough! I enjoyed the beach area very much, snorkelling was great that my day would end around 5pm just reading on the beach lounger and snorkelling afterwards. Island cooler on the beach, heavenly! I didn’t get to enjoy the main pool, but the more secluded pool just beside ACQUA, was super inviting. Dinner at Italian restaurant ACQUA sets the bar in island dinning. They have the best selections of wine, from MOET to Sauvignon blanc to cheaper Spanish concoctions! Another birthday cake and a happy birthday song later, i was deadpan and just cried alone while talking to my family over the phone.TEA OF SPRINGS has this very romantic appeal and sophisticated ambiance matched with great food! The people at Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa are truly amazing, they will surprised you and even go the extra mile just to make you feel special.My only regret was not being able to try the impressive massage at CHI SPA. It was a wonderful birthday and cant wait to go back end of February or this coming summer season.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"My Family and I spent our Christmas 2012 at Cebu and I must say, we are outmost satisfied with the overall package Shangri-La Mactan had to offer.

Upon arrival, we were couteously greeted by their staff. We had no problems in checking in. Lobby was huge but couches in the front desk tend to go full when a number of people checks in and out at the same time. Welcome drinks are also served.

We got 3 Garden View rooms. It was spacious enough with a great view in the veranda of the Garden and the beach as well. Bed was comfortable to sleep on, couch inside the room was also nice. T&B was clean enough and basic toiletries were provided. One thing I didn't like about the bathroom is that they didn't install any bidet and our room was kind of far from the elevator. Took us a couple of minutes to reach it.

Amenities: Wow. Truly a 5-star hotel. Beachfront I believe is their asset. Great sun beds. Beach is being cleaned everyday as seaweeds floating tend to make it look as if it's not clean, but it actually is. My favorite is actually the fact that you need not rent a boat to see a school of fish since it is offered right on their beach. You can have a snorkling gear and dive right there. Their reef is not the best I have seen but is actually commendable.

Food: Lots to choose from. But prepare to spend a lot. The buffet breakfast included in our room availment was superb. Lots of food choices and 3 restaurants within the hotel actually serve breakfast to accomodate all the people checked in.

This hotel offers a lot more than I can describe. so just book it and see for yourself. I would love to go back if time permits.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Our 3 days holiday was a very good holiday.
Our day 1 was welcomed by a very gloomy day - a few rains here and there.. the weather prediction for the next few days was not that good. But even though the weather was not that great, our stay was very enjoyable.
We arrived in the airport and was greeted by the Airport Rep who immediately arranged for our shuttle to the resort..The short shuttle trip was an experienced... you will be able to see the busy streets of Lapu- Lapu city.
Check in was a swift procedure, in a few minutes we were at our rooms..
As we left Manila early and did have a good breakfast, we were all hungry and looking forward for a great lunch...We decided to go the the TIDES restaurant. Service was great, food was great but found the Indian Chicken Curry not that very good..
Pool and Beach Service was superb!!!
I will never forget our Halo-Halo - love it !!! All the other guests were looking on what we ordered!!! It was served on o a fresh coconut!!!
Dinner was ok at the Cowrie Grill - soup was cold.
To kill time, we decided to have a few drinks and be kids at the play room. There is a Time Zone at the hotel!!!
The band singing that night were really good.
I remember a friend forgot to bring rubber slippers and to our surprised... rubber slippers were available in the room!!! not only that the ladies with long hair.. should you forgot to bring ponytail holders... they have one for you. I wish that sunblock is also provided that would be a sure winner!!!
Over-all the stay was very good.",Food:Staff:Location
"This Shangri-La hotel has excellent facilities, good helpful staff and is a well maintained property. Unfortunately, it takes in non-stop large group tours of Korean's and their families. Obviously those groups receive a discounted rate and are allowed to bring free of charge, two children per family.The result is that the place is like a kindergarten, with families unused to what might have been a first class hotel. The place gets swamped with uncontrolled small children. As a consequence perhaps, standards for food are not good and much needs to be desired in terms of choice, quality and price. The hotel is remote from Cebu City proper and can and does charge for meals at a ridiculous rate, for guests are a ""Captive Audience"". On top, there is a service charge of 10%, a food tax and also VAT to pay.I cannot believe the Philippine Government can be serious about wishing to attract holiday business to their Country, with those additional burdens on tourists.",Value for money:Food:Staff

A bit late for the review but still our memories are so vivid and we can't wait to come back this year.

We stayed for 3D/2N at their refurbished wing facing the sea... It was so spectacular. The beach and the pool was just lovely! Breakfast buffet is so fantastic!

I love the scheduled shuttle and how prompt and organize they are. I booked our stay with airport to hotel transfer then vice versa and it was amazing that when we arrive in less than 5 minutes we were being escorted to the coaster and take note - we have it all by ourselves!

"Excellent privacy and lookout. I stayed at this hotel from January 6 to January 11, 2013 to attend an official workshop. This is a nice time to visit Cebu, Philippine. The weather is around 30 degree. This hotel has a very big area, with couple of swimming pools, a mini golf club and small small sub restaurant to serve you as per your need here and there and many more. They have a private sea beach as well. You will simply love that place. The overall service quality of the hotel is very much satisfactory, rooms are nice and clean, breakfast has variety. I personally love to go there again and definitely will stay at Shangri-La's Mactan Resort & Spa. Slightly expensive but the money back is guaranteed. One thing I really like to share which I liked most is the privacy of the hotel, you will simply feel it. I am requesting you all to stay this hotel and feel the beauty of nature at its best.

But the Tea of Spring when we dined in with my bff, mom & dad gosh... its really expensive..ordering a fish, 3 cups of rice & a stir fry veggie & one cup of soup cost us PHP3K+ not to mention the food is really bland. my bff & i just had a hard laugh about it.

service staff were very courteous & polite..my son (alexander) & my niece (alessandra) had a great time in the beach, swimming pool, play room plus we were surprised that there is a time zone inside the hotel. dont forget to avail your 1 hour free kayak, & snorkeling once checked in.

"The Title says Everything. Its my Favorite among All the Hotels i've been. Upon entry the vast garden heavily secured and guarded gates welcomes you. as you enter the Lobby the cool wind, nice welcome juice, folk dance will make you feel like a VIP. The staff will take care of your check in procedures so all you need to do is enjoy. Choose the sea view room as always and the BIG Marsmallow like Bed will just make you feel like a KING. The Buffet is something not to be missed. even here in Makati Shang the Buffet is something not to be missed same as the one at Intercontinental Makati ( best hotel buffet i have tried ) so going back to Shang Cebu. Take your towel go to the Pool which is really Deep and Fun. more Play under water with this depth. Take your bfast outside the garden with all the maya maya birds chirping and asking for crumbs. Its really pure vacation and luxury i may say. The Bar in the evening is a bit pricey for a cocktail drink but it wont hurt if you tell the hotel bar staff if he can be a friend and give you a buy 1 get 1 free refill. i always get 1 when i stay. The beach. Mactan island is a rocky area to have a Boracay type of beach, but i guess shang did something to remove those rocks so that you can enjoy the beach with white sand. i suggest to rent the Catamaran and sail in the middle, they do have lessons for 1st timer and its a good water sport to enjoy. BTW shangrila is near the airport so its better to stay here after you see everything in cebu city so that you dont need to travel back to cebu city to shop, but incase you forgot to buy your CNT lechon and danggit, then the hotel provides free shuttle to sm cebu and glorieta.",Food:Value for money:Location
"resorts I`ve ever been to.

Everything was perfect - there is nothing more to say.

Only minus point may be the restaurants located in Shangri-la. they are expensive and the food is OK, but it`s not very good as you would expect from the Shangri la. Best was by far the pizza in the Italian restaurant.

Shangri la is also big enough that you are not directly confronted with the neighbourhood in Mactan, which is mostly slum-like.

If you want to dive, I would recommend to compare prices with the Shangri la`s diving school and schools from outside.

The breakfast was excellent, the service as well! For children the resort is a wonderlad - lot`s of playground there.",Food:Location
"I had gone to Cebu to attend a CEO Summit and I stayed at this place. I had read about Cebu before leaving Bangalore, but I had no knowledge about the hotel where I was going to stay. The first day, when I arrived, it was off-day and it took me close to five hours just to explore the whole hotel. Its massive big, beach side with fantastic view of the ocean. With luxurious room on 4th floor, the sunset was a delight to watch. The quality of service was excellent. I tasted all types of food. It was good. I have been planning to take my family to Cebu and I will definitely stay at Mactan and in Shangri-La.",Food:Location
"I spent a few nights here in an Ocean view twin room to finish up my vacation in Philippines intending to just spend most of the time on a sun lounge.
It's a bit of a trek from downtown Cebu, and be warned that, as in Manila, taxi drivers will be inclined to want extra cash to take you there, especially at night.. And after a couple of nights you may want to go into town for a bit of variety.

Check in, etc was all very efficient and friendly - the staff in general were fantastic across the board.

The beach was much better than I expected, with plenty of sand and loungers.

There was a wide range of guests - all ages and nationalities, which was a nice change of pace.

I had a twin room which had in-room safe and a nice view to the sea, and plenty of space. Bathroom was a good size and immaculate. Complimentary water and fruit daily as well as a newspaper added a nice touch.

I ate at the buffet one evening and it was pretty good, though not as good as the Shang in KL.

There was a great band playing in the foyer bar and bar staff were great fun. That said, don't expect any real party atmosphere at this resort - it's not really that kind of place... For a nightlife with more life you'll need to get yourself a friendly cab ride to Cebu.
The bar staff told me about a place called Lotus outside the hotel, but made it clear that it wasn't really for people of my shade of pale, and that I should only think to go there after a few more days in the sun... Weather hasn't been great, so I still don't know...

I booked via Agoda, and so got a good deal on rates.

I would go again for a long weekend or for a night of relaxation mid business trip to Cebu.... But it's probably a little quiet for my taste.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Expectations are always high at a Shangri-La Resort, and this one delivers. The usual suspects are there, such as a large and diverse pool complex (with water slide for kids), the gorgeous Chi Spa, multiple restaurant options, kids club, etc. Where this resort has an advantage is at the beach. There is an outstanding house reef, reachable even for younger children. You may see dozens of tropical fish species including sargent majors, clown fish, eels, parrotfish, damsels, and even a few lion fish, Giant clams also seen in deeper water. Excellent water sports options abound as well at the beach. A top notch resort with attentive staff. I would definitely stay here again.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Pros :
-Complimentary airport pickup
-Family friendly environment with kids pools, water slides, miniature golf, ping pong table and adventure zone with giant slides (for a fee).
- Complimentary bottles of water, nespresso coffee, tea.
- Free in room Wi-Fi
- Daily fresh fruits
- Packed breakfast for early check out
- Private beach

Most the pros are standard amenities for any 5 stars resort. There is really no wow factor here.

Cons :

-Room - we have a suite with a separate sitting area but the room still feels small and no view. Bathroom is not too spacious. The room does not have a wow factor.
-Breakfast - good selections but the restaurant is crowded during the peak holiday season, so service was rush and not too attentive.
- We could not find any poolside attendants to order food. We had to walk to the bar in person to ask for service.
- Unlike other Shangri-La resort, some facilities for kids (Adventure zone ) are not complimentary.
- Kids do not get special treats upon check in even it's a family resort. Nor was there kids slippers or robes.
-Kids pool are crowded and many pool chairs were occupied by hotel nannies watching the kids.
- Shuttle bus to airport on certain hours only. For early check out, need to take hotel car which is 4x more $ than the metered taxi.
- Metered taxis are hard to get as they are all outside the entrance of hotel which a 2 mins drive from the lobby. It seems that the hotel discourages guests using metered taxis.

"We had a great time at the Shangri-la. It's only a 15 minute ride from the airport, which makes it a great weekend get-away splurge. The dinner buffets, although pricey, were delicious. The snorkeling on the private beach was fantastic. Not only was the water warm and inviting, but we saw so many colorful, tropical fish. The secluded grounds will really make you feel like you're away from it all. This is definitely not the most exotic place you can visit in the Philippines, but the service from the staff, the private beach, and the good snorkeling made it a worthwhile visit for us. Since the food prices are a bit high, you may want to take the Shangri-la's complimentary shuttle to SM Mall to eat at less-pricey establishments.",Food:Location:Value for money
"Our family of 2 adults and 2 kids stayed at the resort over Christmas night. This is our 3rd stay here, since New Year's Eve of 2000. No doubt, the rates at this Shangri-la resort is always higher than other Shangri-la resorts over the holiday periods, but it still provides endless recreation for everyone, somewhat justifying the higher pricing. The resort was clearly full and busy, but everywhere, from the front desk, to the baggage handling service, to housekeeping, staff was always helpful and prompt, never once showing signs of fatigue or being overworked. That's the beauty of the service industry in the Philippines. We also note that the hotel continually upgrades itself (we did notice that our room was refurbished), and also added more water play areas, etc, to provide more variety.

One of our bags did not arrive at the airport and when we checked in, the lady at the reception (I'm sorry we didn't get her name) immediately offered to help us retrieve it from the airport the following day on the same flight using the resort shuttle van. All we had to do was to hand her the lost baggage form. Since we were there for only one night, and did not have any beachwear with us, she offered complimentary amenitiy kits, and to extend our stay to as late as possible the following day. Sure enough, two beautiful boxes were delivered to our room, consisting of t-shirts, shorts, disposable underwear, cleansing solutions, deodorant and hairgel. My husband's shorts did not fit him, and housekeeping went back and forth twice more to bring him the right size. That's the 5-star quality service this resort offers which makes it so popular and for customers to return time and again.

It was packed at the pools and beach, but the clear blue waters with fish swimming around your feet, and extensive facilities like snooker, ping pong tables, mini golf, badminton make this place a fun setting for the whole family. Not to mention the indoor adventure zone and e-zone for when it rains or a reprieve from the sun and sand.

I had a massage at the Chi spa that night, and the therapist, Girlie, was one of the best I've experienced (this is comparing with Banyan Tree Spas and Mandara Spas in the region).

Needless to say, we will return yet again, but perhaps during a less peak period the next time around!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"we booked through agoda the night before and they did not receive our reservation. when you arrive there is a lot of greetings but it does not seem genuine and everyone is following a playbook script. we arrived in the hotel late, shown to our room was nice gesture but not necessary. the room itself compared to north america would be would be a three star hotel .. rooms need updating and nothing home to write about. we headed to tides restaurant at 10 pm after being told it would close at 11 pm. we ordered and was rushed to have our main entree then 5 minutes later asked to clear our bill. we paid and then everyone vanished ... couldn't even get a refill of water ..what was the point of paying the mandatory service charge for no service? breakfast was ok and the beach area was the nicest in the area. i would say the service was better after spending a couple of nights at plantation bay. for the money you pay at shangri-la, it isn't really worth it. the grounds remind me of sheraton in maui. otherwise i would say it was a miss and disappointment. spend your money elsewhere.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"We were disappointed with our stay at the resort. It started when we checked in, the first thing they said was we see you booked your room through Expedia which I was curious why they felt they had to mention that. I booked a deluxe garden room. When we got to our room, our view was the roof of the front driveway.

Restaurants... The seafood restaurant location was beautiful. We ordered steak but very tough. Breakfast the next day was not any better. They had 2 locations and we chose the one closest to us on the first day. We felt like we were in a low class buffet crammed packed of people. The next day we chose the other restaurant and the environment was better but the quality of food was not impressive.

Saturday night Hawaiian show... The food again was ok and the show was disappointing. The sound quality of the performance was poor. Save your money, go to dinner somewhere else and sit in the back to watch the show for free.

Checkout - when I mentioned the room and the restaurant, they were apologetic. As I was paying my bill, the other lady told the lady that was helping us in filipino not charge us for the airport shuttle fee. The lady helping us said in Filipino never mind, I already did. Well, I spoke Filipino and I asked her to take it off. She did.

We have been to several 5 star resorts around the world and this has to be the most disappointing. Prior to our stay in Shangri La, we stayed at Marco Polo for 5 days and we have to share that they exceeded our expectations. Marco Polo's service is excellent, their restaurants are excellent and their hotel is beautiful. Unfortunately not close to the beach but only a taxi ride to wherever you need to go in the city.

The only thing I can say the best thing Shangri La has is the beach area.",Food:Staff:Location
"If you are looking for a resort to relax, unwind, and just do nothing, the Shangri-la at Mactan is the place to be. Located on Mactan Island, the resort is a 15-minute drive from the Cebu airport. After a long journey, a short ride to the hotel is always a welcome. The resort staff were friendly and always available to help. They upgraded us to a suite, which included a living room, a maid's room, which was the smaller than what I would call a walk-in closet in the US, two bathrooms, and a very large balcony with two lounge chairs and resting area. I could have been happy just to spend the vacation in our room ordering room service around the clock.

However, I was in Cebu to take a GUE dive course, which took place at Scotty's dive shop, located on the grounds of the hotel, and I did not have time to enjoy the amenities of the hotel much. If I hadn't been there for a dive course, I would have lounged by one of the two pools, worked out in the fitness gym, sipped cocktails in several of their bars, or just read and napped in a lounge chair in the privacy of our living-room sized balcony. Because the dive course required almost 12hours of theory/diving, I was a little disappointed that I could not truly enjoy all the hotel amenities. However, we made it back to the hotel a few evenings to catch the cocktail hour in the executive lounge and the staff members were wonderful. They kept our wine glasses full.

Just a few minutes walk outside the hotel entrance there are a few restaurants that offer a change from the resort restaurants. We tried Michelangelo's for their pizza. It was okay, but not good enough for us to leave the resort again for another meal. Both Acqua and Cowrie Cove were okay hotel food - nothing spectacular but easy and convenient. We had a list of restaurants we wanted to try in Cebu, but because of our late finishes each evening and the bad Cebu traffic, we opted not to venture out into Cebu late for dinner. After a full day of diving, all we wanted to do was have a glass or two of wine, eat a few bites and go to bed. However, if we were to go back to stay at the resort, without other commitments, we would definitely try the Cebu restaurants recommended by others.

There is a marine sanctuary just off the beach from the hotel. Because visitors have taken to feeding the fish, it's easy to step into the ocean and have a swarm of fish swimming around you, hoping for a morsel of food. I have never experienced that before-shooing schools of fish away from my face. The resort has all the water-activities you could want-scuba diving, snorkeling, banana-boating, jet skiing, etc. Although my husband and I were there as a couple, the resort is perfect for families because there are lots of activities for kids - water slides, jungle gyms, kids activities - and an area where you can drop off your kids, if parents need an ""adult' break.

I recommend the resort for couples, families, friends and business travelers.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We were expecting to stay in a 'Garden View' room, but were interested to find we were given a room which faced the pools and sea. Not a 'sea-view' though as we were low down and adjacent to the roof over the restaurant - 'cement-roof view' really but no big deal. The room was rather tired, with scuffed and damaged fittings, no plug in the bath, very poor reception on the TV and a flickering strip light by the bed - there is a program of refurbishment taking place and it was very good of the maintenance man to assure us that our 'room would be much better in a year's time!' (very helpful). Anyway, he replaced the TV and fixed the bath so we were happy enough. Just a rather underwhelming start to our holiday.

Let's be positive, the main buildings, grounds, pools and beach area are all beautifully maintained; a stunning environment in which to relax and unwind. The fitness gym was excellent with all facilities well equipped and staffed. The quality of food was good, if a little expensive. Our son enjoyed the snorkelling, swimming pools and water-playground, he also enjoyed a few sessions in the 'Funzone' such as the T-Shirt painting. The staff are fantastic; always smiling and keen to please. Shops, bars and entertainment all good.

Some issues we encountered are basically a result of the size of the hotel. Long queues at breakfast time, room not made up until late in the afternoon and (despite what other reviewers might say) 'poolside sun-lounger politics' every morning. Having stayed at Shangri-La properties in Penang and Kota Kinabalu, we were surprised and disappointed at just how many of the activities and facilities had to be paid for as 'extras'. Whereas we could grab a kayak and go for a free paddle in KK, here we had to pay. Dropping in and out of a range of activities at the kids club wasn't an option either (different to Penang) as you pay for a whole morning or afternoon session. Basically, no opportunity is missed to get more money out of you; the fact that the 'free shuttle' service to the shopping mall costs money being a perfect example.

Reading back, I realise this review sounds rather more negative than intended. The resort is beautiful and the setting superb; we always treat disappointments philosophically and we did have a great week. The convenience of direct flights from Hong Kong and proximity to the airport mean it's a place we probably would return to. It's not cheap though and when you pay that much you don't necessarily expect an occasionally shabby experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"I stayed in a refurbished garden view room for two nights, and though find it a great experience, it is still not perfect. although compared to the Shangri La in Boracay, this is definitely more worth it (depending on what you seek, though).

Service is warm and great, but not consistent. My room did not had tea and only had coffee. This happened over two days. Yes, I really want my tea. The refurbished room looks clean and new and bathroom was clean. Bed wise, as with all Shang, is firm and comfy. The only other fault i can complain about is that the light settings could have also been remodeled to have a gradual intensity setting when turning it on; now, all the beams just straight out when you turn the switch-not necessarily ideal for someone who is waking up.

The beach here is great, and i spent most days and afternoons there. the waters are amazingly clear and you do see fishes constantly in the clear waters. Bring water shoes if you intend to walk in as there are lots of edgy coral reefs. so the beach is not exactly perfect for a dip with all that rocks (Borocay is reef free and has great waves, but lack the clarity as it is deeper)

Staff everywhere are so attentive and they can spot what you need or want almost immediately. Though I had same problems with getting help from staff when I head towards the beach; no one spotted me and I had to find my own spot and get my own towels.

There also also two huge pools for you to choose from; I spent time mostly at the smaller (but still huge) Ocean Wing pool as there are lesser kids.

Dining wise, food was decent at the many restaurants and I really enjoyed the outdoor area for dinner at Cowrie Cove as the waves come sweeping into the shoreline. Breakfast was included in room rate and had a great huge wonderful selection. Service here also seemed calmer compared to Borocay despite the throngs of Japanese and Koreans.

Chinese food was also not bad, and prices are almost on par with better restaurants in town.

There is also wifi throughout the hotel, even on the beach, though connectivity can be on-off. The shuttle to the mall costs 100 pesos per person and i rec. one to head to Ayala Mall rather than SM as Ayala is ore upscale and with better dining options. Even if you cannot make it back on the bus, the cab from Ayala to the resort costs less than 300 pesos. In short, if there are 2 or you, which will most likely be, just grab a cab. The cabs are all metered and when you get onto one at designated taxi stands at airport, malls or the hotels, there will be someone to pass you a note with the cab license so you can always file a complain should they not charge you by the meter.",Food:Value for money:Location
"This seems to be a nice place for a family vacation, with a large property and good beach access. Scine it is a beach resort, note that it is not near Cebu City. It is said to be among the largest of the Shangri-la hotel properties. However, I found the rooms to be quite plain and rather dated. I haven't seen a cathode ray tube (CRT) TV in a 5 star hotel in a while. More disappointing was the service. I had to call numerous times for simple items such as toilet paper. One also has to call housekeeping to get a toothbrush which I also found unusual for a 5 star hotel. This hotel charges substantially more than others in Cebu so it seems that basic serives and amenities could be provided smoothly. With some interior upgrading and revire of their service standard, perhaps this hotel can again be one to look forward to visiting in the future.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money
"From Crimson resort, we went directly to Shangri-La resort and availed a one day stay. We are very happy that we chose this place as our last destination for our vacation. I've been to Shangri-La for several occasions but we never got the chance to really book a room and try out their facilities.
During our stay there, I am very pleased on how well maintain the place is. It has a great and sunny atmosphere. We had a garden view room and we are delighted with what we saw from our balcony, the view is breath taking. Place is really relaxing. Room is modern. Flat screen TV, Fresh fruits were provided, comfortable bed etc. CR is a bit small compared to Crimson but I can't really complain because we spent most of our time outside exploring the place. Great pool area, Great beach and I love the fact that there are plenty of fishes while swimming on their beach, Great landscape, place is also a paradise for children.

Customer Service is also great. People are always ready to help you with inquiries, they are always smiling and attentive.

Food is also delicious in Tides with a wide variety to choose from.

Minor problem is our stay comes with a free kayak and snorkeling package. But when we inquired on how we can avail it, they said that we can only avail it at 2pm. It’s a bit disappointing if you're staying for 1 day only. We checked in at 2pm so there's no chance we can avail the offer. I hope they can look into this so that those who are staying 1 day only can avail this.

The ocean view is highly recommended, great to have early morning coffee outside the terrace. Bathrooms just OK but high end toiletries like L'Occitane.

The first time, our children were playing and no one told them about the procedure and that they would have to order the food themselves through the staff - so once they ordered they still had to wait for over 1 hour for lunch. Unacceptable for children. 2 days later they came back for lunch, this time we asked specifically for lunch to be before 1 pm (they arrived at 12:20) as they were hungry and had a lesson at 2 pm. By 1:45 lunch had still not arrived. We asked several times and finally at 1:55 lunch came. This was very disappointing.",Food:Staff

As an aside, there are a lot of first-world problems here – it’s perfectly possible to have a decent stay just about anywhere. However, when you are parents to two super-active toddlers, a rare break is not to be messed around by inept service and poor room design.

Hindsight is a wonderful thing and in retrospect the choice of Shangri-La could have hinted at the issues to come, as this is one of the most inconsistent higher-end chains around with some very good properties, some terrible ones and an even worse loyalty program (if anyone can explain the relevance of Golden Circle, please send details!).

Overall, this is a fairly typical resort in terms of the hotel and services – large pools (family and Ocean), several restaurants, an indoors’ kids play area, bars etc… the staff is incredibly friendly – only smiling people from the moment you get picked up at the airport (Ocean club and suites have access to a free shuttle but we booked a private car with the hotel to make it easier with small kids – no issue at arrival).

We were greeted by our “butler” and checked-in our suite (Casa Suite).

Overall, Shangri-La has one thing going for it – its amazing photographer. The online pictures of the resort and the suites are really beautiful and give such a great sense of space – reality however is very different. The Casa Suite we had turned out to be fairly dark and far less spacious that I had anticipated. It suffers from one major design problem and several minor aspects (to taste) – #1 problem is a connecting door in the bedroom. This is simply idiotic – usually a suite with a connecting door would have it in the lounge, which enables the hotel to sell either a suite plus separate room or a two-bedroom suite with a shared lounge in between both bedrooms… here no such logic – the connecting door is right next to the bed. Huge problem as we would soon find out.

Other aspects include over-sized furniture for the space and a ceiling design with a cornice going around the room which gave the impression of having a much lower ceiling than in reality, further reducing the sense of space. Basically this room was designed for the photographer, not guests.

That aside, several other issues – electric curtain was faulty (never fixed despite raising this several times), taps were wobbly, room was set-up for one kid when we had two clearly stated in the reservation…

On our first night, we were awoken at 5.45AM by our neighbours talking – the connecting door is very poorly soundproofed and what was a normal conversation was loud enough to wake the kids up… after flagging this to the front desk, we were shown two other suites – the Veranda suite (same connecting door issue so pointless despite being nice otherwise) and the Panorama suite (not refurbished, very dated décor). However rather than try and make amends, we were asked 5000PHP to move room… since the Panorama suite didn’t appeal at all and that we were promised further padding foam would be added we stayed put – it has never before happened that a hotel would try and charge extra to move me… amazing.

Room issue aside (more on this shortly), service throughout the hotel was patchy at best – terrible food in Tides, very limited pool-side service at the Ocean pool (if you can find someone, they bring lunch without any cutlery or napkins – happened throughout the stay), inability to manage basic requests (table booking was farcical, phone lines never answered, housekeeping was inconsistent and always missed some items), completely chaotic breakfasts in Tides and also in the Ocean club lounge where we battled a constant supply issue for high chairs, zero use of the “butler” whom we only saw twice again in the club lounge, inconsistent in-room dining service – but all with lots of smiles. Quite tiring after a while.

The most telling aspect was when we eventually got to speak to one of the managers and she admitted that due to various cost cutting, all the best staff had left for cruises and other hotels, leaving casual workers and less experienced people… what an amazing thing to admit to! She also offered cheese puffs to compensate us – by then we were speechless.

Back in the room, on our third night a new neighbor decided to smoke in their non-smoking room – the connecting door enabled smoke to seep in which again disturbed us. So this design issue is far more than a cosmetic problem – it will indeed affect your stay.

Upon our departure, checking out took way too long and we had also a smaller car than the one coming in – so they switched car but charged me the same amount – classy!

Overall, the kids enjoyed the pool and water slides but the parents didn’t have much to relax about – service is truly horrible (didn’t dare use a hotel babysitter), the room was OK but very expensive for the size and the overall value is extremely low. If coming from Singapore, this seems like a rather long flight when there are better choices from Bali to Bintan a shorter distance away. I would say that with older kids (6 to 14), the resort may work well but set your expectations to low in terms of service.

Some further tips…

1. If you are still undeterred, I would recommend booking a normal room in the Ocean Club levels – this caters to most needs, affords easy access to the Ocean Pool and beach and the lounge access is definitely relevant here. The lounge offers a good option for a light evening meal (excellent pastries too) and Aqua is really pretty good and ideally located. For those looking for a bigger accommodation, the Veranda suite with a connecting room (so for those with two bedrooms requirement) is nice. Take a room ending in an odd number to be on the resort side.

2. Beware of the packages on offer – I didn’t find a single one to be of real value. For example, one package offered a PHP4500 credit for the stay… since we stayed 5 nights and this was offered at a cost of PHP2000/night over the standard rate, we would have been paying 10K to get 4.5K back… Similarly, a package offered at 5000PHP extra per night provided dinner at Tides. For the reasons mentioned above I strongly discourage this but on top of the quality issues, the cost of buffet dinner is 1800PHP (free for under 4, half price otherwise) so clearly not a good deal in our case.

3. In the same vein, be careful when shopping in the hotel store if looking for last minute clothing items – I had to buy a no-name brand anti-rash shirt and paid 2800PHP when another shop (travel store) located within the hotel but managed independently had O’Neill’s shirts for 2200… Amusingly this store also stocks anti bed-bugs spray… go figure! No such issue to report but then again, why are they selling this...

4. There is a regular Filipino-dinner night arranged, which also has small shops – check before buying there – we bought small wooden guitars for the kids (at initially 500PHO, lightly-""negotiated"" down to 350) only to find these for 199 in one of the independent hotel shops… no big deal but no one likes being ripped-off.

5. Make sure to pack suitable waterproof beach footwear – the beach itself is made of crushed up seashells/coral and there are numerous bits of corals sticking up as well as rocks – impossible to walk bare foot. No scuba diving gear to rent for kids so bring your own.

6. There is a 15% F&B discount for your entire spend if using your Amex card to pay – may not be mentioned to you so worth checking.

7. Watch out for black millipedes by the side of the deep end of the Ocean pool (under the concrete ledge of the pool and in Aqua) – my wife had a pretty bad allergic reaction after stepping on/kicking one by accident in the restaurant (!) and these could easily be touched by kids playing in the pool.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"Shangri-La Mactan Resort & Spa did not disappoint at all. my friends and i landed in Cebu with no reservations and/or plans. we decided to get a little fancy and head to the Shangri-La and it was a great decision. it's a bit of a drive from the airport, but once you're on the resort you really don't have to leave the property.

the staff was amazing and even without reservations they were able to give us a great rate. we ended up staying just 2 nights as we had other bookings in Bohol. i really wish we could have stayed here the whole time. the resort is located in a perfect location along the water. only a few other resorts were nearby and not easily accessible from outside the resort.

the resort is MASSIVE. we weren't even able to see the entire resort in 2 days since there was so much to do. the beach (man made) was great. plenty of seats for our group and the service was second to none. we were able to stay on the beach the entire day and not have to go get anything. truly a 5-star experience. we spent a lot of time at the several pools they had... especially the massive one in the middle of the resort. the breakfast buffet was good, but was expecting a bit more for the price. the resort also has several restaurants. we opted for the outdoor buffet and it also came with a little show that was fun. live music and the food was great.

the most impressive part was that we checked in the main part of the resort and our room was on the newer wing. this was roughly a 5 minute walk, but by the time we got there the staff in our wing knew our names and escorted us to our room. i knew as soon as they happened that our stay was going to be great.

our room was quite large as we got a family room. large flat panel TV and even a large balcony (bottom floor). room service was available around the clock and the food was great. definitely try the cocktails at the poolside bar...they were great!

i've stayed at several Shangri-La hotels/resorts and this is by far my favorite. i would definitely recommend this resort to anyone looking to get away from it all. you definitely get what you pay for here.",Food:Location:Value for money
"This is a very high-standard hotel. Although placed in a not a very attractive area in the suburbs of Cebu, the hotel complex offers a variety of attractions: a nice beautiful beach, two large swimming pools, bars and restaurants, a truly lush SPA, diving school, water sports equipment rental, golf course, car rental (you’ll need an international driver’s licence), babysitters, gym, saunas, and so on. So almost anyone can find something for themselves.
Food-wise, there are many international restaurants, from Japanese to an Italian one.
The rooms are spacious, clean and cleaned daily, including sheets & towels change.
On the downside, the housekeeping is apt at subtle thefts – I had some banknotes disappear from my wallet. So you might be willing to use the safe.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Cleanliness
"Stayed at the Shangri la during an Ironman triathlon event. The event made the hotel crazy busy and there were a lot of non hotel guests hanging around the hotel which sort of detracted from the five star feel of the place but thankfully it was only one day so the rest of the time we had a great time. The room we had was an ocean view room, not sure if it was a refurbished room but I thought it was quite comfortable and we had no problems with the doors, bed or windows like some other guests have reviewed. The hotel, although quite large, still feels quite private. It is definitely a children's paradise though with the pool, kids club, slides, beach and all these places to run around in. Our friend's 4 year old daughter who we traveled with couldn't understand why we had to leave. She enjoyed it that much. Not sure if couples who want some peace and quiet away from kids would be quite as enamored with the resort though. The service was amazing and as I went to all the restaurants with my 6 month old baby the staff in every restaurant went to great lengths to make us comfortable. Very impressive. Highly recommended!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"Cebu is a beautiful place to go. The beach is just breathtaking with white sand and transparent waters. The staff at this hotel is extra-attentive, as is very noticeable everywhere in the Philippines. My husband and I went a weekend to this hotel to end our honeymoon. They have free airport shuttle services and receive you in a very accommodating way. I had booked through orbitz and thought the meals were included in the price (which is a bit pricy), but it turned out only breakfast was included and you can't really go out of the hotel to eat, because there's nothing nearby. oh well. I don't regret having paid the price for my meals! The food is SOOOO good! (and I am usually picky). They have about 6 restaurants with really really good food (every meal will cost you about $15-$20 USD per person, though). You can get pizzas at the pool restaurant for about $10 USD (good for 2 people). Most of the restaurant have buffet options, some will hand you the menu. Breakfast at Aqua Restaurant is amazing! They had a full table only for breads (my husband is a big fan of breads), tables of fruit, juices, great coffee, omelets upon request and Filipino rice and food for a cultural taste. They also have water sports and activities available at an extra charge. The Hotel was VERY beautiful and big. The room was great and comfortable with cool toiletries that remind you that you're in a luxurious place. They have 2 very nice pools, shops, table tennis and nice hammocks all around so you can relax. The staff again is very friendly in every part of the hotel. I don't recommend for honeymooners, as it is more of a place for families, but overall a great place, luxurious, with delicious cuisine!",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

Beach Front: was clean with stunning sea view (will take your breath away); the tropical breeze relaxes you as you laze in the sunshine and lounge in the beach chairs; not overly crowded.

Resort grounds | Swimming pool: first class; the lush green garden well kept and the swimming pools are perfect for families with children.

"My partner and I visited the Shangri-La Mactan Resort during the China National week, keen to escape the craziness of Shanghai, where we live!

I must admit that my initial impression wasn't so great - yes the check in staff were all very welcoming and friendly but once we got to our 'refurbished' room, I definitely felt a little underwhelmed.

We have stayed in the Shangri-La hotel in Shanghai and were amazed by their luxurious rooms, so I guess we were expecting the same here and instead we felt that it all looked okay but it was how an average hotel room looked in the 90s - it felt very dated, with not much of a hint to the beautiful location apart from a couple of naff shell pictures on the wall. Oh and if you book a 'Seaview room', just be prepared that your main view will be of the pool and gardens. I felt that this was a little misleading of them, as the room should have been labelled 'Poolview with a hint of Sea to the side!' if they were going to be honest.

We had so many issues with the room, including the bathroom handle falling off, balcony door not locking, lights not working etc not to mention the very poor service by the housekeeping staff... yes, they were very friendly and polite but they came into our room one morning when we were on the balcony and they didn't know we were there, as the curtains were closed, and they were literally in the room for 5 minutes. Bathroom amenities were not replenished apart from the occasional extra shampoo, but they didn't check to see what else we had used, like cotton buds, shower cap etc. Numerous stains that were on the bathroom floor and desk when we arrived were still there at the end of our trip a week later - it was a horrible feeling to know that we had paid a lot of money for a room and yet we were going to sleep at night, not knowing when the surfaces, bathroom, floor or carpet had last had a thorough clean.
This is a big hotel so I can imagine that the housekeeping services are stretched but if that is the case, they really need to employ more people for this role.

I even wrote a long note, detailing all of the issues that needed fixing with the room, which I left for the manager, and I have never ever done that before! But I felt that if I didn't say anything, then whoever stayed in that room next would wonder why this 'refurbished' room had all of these problems.

We received a reply from the manager, which frustrated me a little as I would have assumed he would eat a slice of humble pie and just say 'thank you', however, he felt the need to explain and justify the points which I had raised, which I felt was a sign that in his eyes, the customer is clearly not always right.

For example, I said that the pillows were awful (the kind that are high when you look at them and then sink down to 1cm once you put your head on them) so I explained that most 5* hotels are offering a pillow menu now where guests can choose the best pillow for them and he said that actually this WAS available... well I looked in the hotel book and saw that you could get a hypo-allergenic pillow... ummmm is THAT your idea of a pillow MENU?! and there was nothing in an obvious place, for example, a card on the pillow or on the bedside table AND in fact, another recent reviewer also commented on EXACTLY the same issue, so it is clearly not just me who has missed this invisible pillow menu. Hopefully the manager will soon realise that if more than one guest is making comments about things like pillows, housekeeping staff etc. then maybe that is actually helpful information which he could use to make the hotel better... hmmm, you'd think wouldn't you?!?!

The overall service at this hotel from restaurant staff, to the gardeners, to the pool staff was EXCELLENT... everyone that you see greets you with a smile and a kind word.

Food is generally very good... you MUST go to Acqua for breakfast as Tides is generally a nightmare... we likened it to a cheap cafeteria, where guests push and shove and is just way too crowded. We felt quite stressed on our first day, thinking that we wouldn't actually get any chance to relax here, but the breakfast service at Acqua was a lot more civilised.
Dinner at Acqua was also excellent and the beach bar and pool bar were great for lunchtime choices. Although quite often our first choices at restaurants were not available, so always have a second option of what you want to eat. Our only let down with food was at Cowrie Cove, which was our most expensive meal and the most bland... but our dear manager friend has assured us that he has informed the chef of our concerns... yes I'm sure that was the first thing on his to-do list - go and tell him that we were underwhelmed with his food! Hmmmmm....!

The pools are lovely and the sunbeds are great to relax on (although stay away from the garden areas, as we were covered in ants one afternoon, despite there being no food anywhere near us), however don't stay here if you like a gorgeous beach. We went for one walk on the beach in our whole stay here, as the sand is very rough and rocky... basically if you've ever been to beaches in Thailand, you'll be disappointed with the sand quality! However, we went diving when we were here and the sealife is brilliant so you will enjoy snorkelling or diving in this area.

We went to the spa one day, which was good, although of course the services are over-priced, which we knew to expect from a 5* hotel. It felt like they were constantly plugging for more sales though, even after we'd paid and were relaxed and wanted to chill out, we kept hearing 'and maybe you could come back and have a head massage next time to compliment your massage from today?! yes? I can book you in now?!' Ummmm no thanks, we've just paid an arm and a leg already!

This is definitely a family hotel and as we were there as a couple, we did find it hard to find a quiet area, away from screaming kids... or screaming parents more like! And the tacky evening shows are unfortunately hard to miss, as you'll hear some dreadful drumming for a good couple of hours, so don't sit on the balcony thinking you can have a drink and enjoy the peace and quiet!

We personally wouldn't come back here again but I would recommend it to families who have young/teenage children and who don't mind a rough beach and a slightly dirty hotel room!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Regardless of whether your stay is for business or pleasure - the Shangri-la Mactan Resort & Spa is by far the best hotel, resort and spa in the Cebu/Mactan region.

The new kids water park is a great addition for your family holiday and it has the only white sand beach in the area which is a huge bonus, as is the kids playground area.

There are regular fireworks displays for weddings and other parties which naturally are enjoyed by all guests. The downside is occasionally the music and noise continues into the night (as late at midnight sometimes) - so if you have a sea view room, you could be kept up a little late.

The Spa is spectacular and the treatments great. The downside though is that the dressing rooms have seen better days and I was scared to use the steam room and sauna because it didn't seem the cleanest.

The restaurant and room service meals are generally good and enjoyed, with us rarely not liking a meal or not being able to eat it. The Ocean Club provides a great bonus to those staying in a club room with evening cocktails and snacks served for two hours - get in early, while the food is replenished it quickly gets busy. The staff are also ultra-generous with the drinks. They are also very attentive and remember your name and favourite drink/food whether it be for breakfast or other times.

The hotel is bar far the best in the area and we have stayed at all the competitors. With free wifi and courtesy cars which can collect you from the airport (which also have wifi in the car) you can seamlessly walk around the entire hotel and stay connected. Great for a quick VOIP call to let someone know you have arrived safely.",Food
"I've been to the Shangri-la in Cebu on two separate occasions. It's generally our pick of place to stay in Cebu because it's so large and nice to just spend the entire weekend (we go for weekends from HK) at the hotel grounds without ever having to leave. The buffet breakfast is great, with a wide variety of Western and Asian choices.

The staff are friendly and even allowed us to check in super early after we took a redeye in, arriving around 5 or 6 a.m., effectively giving us almost another whole day without an upcharge, which we really appreciated (otherwise we would have had to sleep at the pool).

The rooms are nice, the pools are great, with poolside service, and the beach is fantastic with snorkel gear, etc, for rent (and tons of fish just right in the water on the beach). Staff are friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend if you're OK with the higher price range it commands.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"If you've ever been to Hawaii (Honolulu) and stayed at the Kahala, then the Shang hotel feels like the Kahala. But, the Shang is better, bigger and with nicer amenities and facilities and a more beautiful beach and more fun-looking pools.

When you're inside the grounds of the hotel, you feel like you're somewhere else, far removed from the chaos of Cebu. Honestly, it felt like I was in Honolulu - but with the renowned hospitality of Filipinos (and friendly rates too). You had your own world while in Shang and you felt wonderfully disconnected.

We stayed at the refurbished sea view wing with the view of the pool and the sea. The wind was relaxing, and with the al fresco theme of the hotel, you could constantly hear the chirping of birds. The landscaping was nice - green all around. At night, it was relaxing just going around the paths from the pool down to the beach, up to the front of the Tides.

The breakfast selection at the Tides was great and food was delicious. Though the area can get crowded and cramped, especially the portion by the egg station. It wasn't the peak season when my wife and I were there, but I can only imagine how chaotic the Tides can be during peak season.

The room itself is wonderful. Nice shower, beautiful interiors and superb lighting. You also had free bottled water every day. The bed was comfortable (though the pillows were too soft).

The hotel has free shuttle service to and from SM and Ayala (mall centers). And to certain tourist spots. We didn't avail of those though since we just wanted to bum and relax in the hotel.

For a quiet and romantic dinner, try the Cowrie Cove. Try their fresh seafood - salmon, prawns, squid, lobsters, skewers. And you can request for them to cook it any way you want. In fact, my wife had the prawns done thermidor-style, and the chef did so (cheesy and delectable)!

Airport shuttle leaves hourly (not 30 mins or 15 mins). So make sure you allot time for the shuttle versus your departure time.

What also impressed my wife and I were the facilities. The gym was modern and clean with sauna and jacuzzi. The hotel even had an arcade station with billiards, arcade games and even soda and popcorn. They also had a massive (2 floors) playpen for children.

For Catholics, the hotel offers anticipated mass at 5 PM, Saturday.

There seemed to be a lot of Koreans where we there (I think they had a holiday in Korea). You do notice the amount of people during breakfast, but after that, at lunch or dinner, the hotel didn't feel crowded, which was nice. Maybe because it is a big hotel and everyone did their own thing.

Unfortunately, the in-room dining is where Shang missed the mark. When we arrived in the room, we couldn't find the in-room dining menu. So I called to request for one. After 30 mins, no menu still. So, I called back to follow it up. After 10 mins, still no menu. They called me up and asked if I had received the menu already. I said no. Finally, the menu arrived. Thankfully, the food was superb (beef bulgogi, vegetable lasagna, mixed satay) - with free small dessert of coconut macaroons.

Now, we had the food cart stuck in our room (it had to be folded in order to fit through the door). We called them to remove the food cart since we didn't know how to fold up the cart. But they never came to our room. By the middle of the night (after more than 3 hours of waiting), we decided to figure out how to fold the cart. We finally wheeled out the cart ourselves. It's a shame no one came to our room to get the cart.

Also, the level of cleaning by the housekeeping leaves much to be desired. Some trash weren't discarded. Some items were left where they were and not returned. It felt like the cleaning was rushed.

When we were checking out, as I was standing in the lobby waiting for my wife to pay at the counter, I was approached by at least 3 Shang personnel asking how they could help me. Now THAT'S attentive service (I've never gotten that much attention, and I've stayed at the Ritz, the Marriott and Hilton). One staff even asked how our stay went (she was Korean or Japanese), so I aired out my complaint about the in-room dining and food cart. She then took note of it and my room number. Kudos to Shang.

Overall though, my wife and I had a wonderful time in this hotel. Good food, awesome landscape, great facilities - I was pleasantly surprised that one can get this level of satisfaction so near Metro Manila (just a 1-hour flight). We shall definitely come back!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"From the bad experience at Waterfront, my dad and I went straight to Mactan Shangri-la and wow what a change! The garden is huge, so green. Service is fantastic and food was great at Tides Restaurant. Cowrie Cove restaurant also saves delectable cuisine and really is value for money. The rooms are grand (but they need to change their TVs) and are overlooking the sea (at least for the room we got). It is very much peaceful and I just wonder how much work and money goes to maintenance. All pools have their stationed lifeguards. All employees of the hotel greet you with sincerity - from the frontdesk from the best sweepers there are in Cebu. The beach is a marine marvel. Go to the beach and experience snorkeling without even going far or riding a boat. The fishes are all there near the beach! Everything is accessible and my dad really enjoyed snorkeling except for that jellyfish bite.

One thing to note though: to the management team - consider putting more people to assist during breakfast at Tides Restaurant. I'm really a fan of customer service and somehow you don't want your guests to be lining up to get breakfast - doesn't sound like 5 star, right?

Anyway, it really Shangri-la! Will go back soon with the whole family.",Food:Location
"Our Family stayed at the Shang the last time we were at Cebu. We choosing between Shagri-La and Crimson resort but we couldn't find a review that compares the two resorts so we decided to just stay in both resorts and I would have to say that Shang wins the comparison hands down.

The service was impeccable. It feels that the staff are always one step ahead of your needs. Sometimes, it was a bit too much though. The amenities were superb, I loved that the pools were luke warm so it was fun to swim any time of the day. The kiddie water play area was a big hit and my daughter loved it! she just couldn't get enough of the slides.

My hubby particularly liked the basketball in the pool, it was indeed fun.

The breakfast was really good with so much choices and you just couldn't choose what to eat :D.

The only thing that I liked at Crimson better than Shang is the room, the rooms at shang are clean and well appointed but the TVs are outdated.

"We stayed in this hotel on a four day family vacation, and booked three rooms on a busy public holiday weekend. Despite the hotel being at full capacity, I felt that the staff coped well with the number of guests. The service was warm and friendly, and replicated the 'Shangri-la' standard of service that is found in their two branches in Manila.

The rooms are newly renovated and very spacious. We only had one extra bed in our room, but we were able to easily fit four people in it, as the beds were absolutely massive. The bathroom was a good size also, with a plentiful supply of towels.

The only disappointment on our trip was the visit to the onsite Chinese restaurant, where the quality of food didn't reflect the standard of the other hotel restaurants. The dimsum had obviously been frozen beforehand, which really affected the taste. However, I suppose that excuses can be made for our bad experience here, as Mactan is essentially an island, so I suppose some ingredients can be difficult to find here.

We would, however, recommend the Italian restaurant for their black pasta, which was lovely.

Breakfast was good though the standard and quality has definitely dropped from our first visit a few years ago. There is a fantastic array of cereals, breads, muffins, pancakes, etc. and a range of hot foods, like bacon, sausage, local meat, fried noodles and rice. They also offered sushi, cold soda noodles and Chinese rice porridge.

However, they used to have a chocolate fountain and a pancake/waffle/crepe station, which has since disappeared. They now set out cooked pancakes and waffles on display, and don't really make them to order anymore, though I am sure that they'll whip up a fresh batch for you if requested.

They also have a station where you can choose from seafood or meat noodle soup - they cook it for you on site, and you can add vegetables/sauces as an option as well. The fresh juices were very good and available in watermelon, pineapple, orange (these changed daily).

The gym was really well equipped, and the sauna was good though a little outdated. The gym was manned by an assistant who handed out towels and bottles of water, and he was absolutely brilliant - as soon as I got on the treadmill, he offered me a pair of earphones, and taught me how to watch TV and change the channels on the machine. He also attempted to teach my sister (who is a personal trainer) how to use the weight machines, much to her amusement. However, he did have the best of intentions :) There's also a supply of fruit in the gym and you can grab your own bottled water and towel if the assistant is busy.

If you're local, I would strongly recommend that you call the hotel direct for their best rates. We took a package that included breakfast, return airport transfer, and 3 standard rooms for 3 nights (including one extra bed), and saved over US$1000 as opposed to booking online via their official website.

Despite the small hiccups, we had a fantastic family holiday here and would strongly recommend the Shangri-la to other guests. The quality of service and accommodation is unmatched elsewhere in Mactan Island, so you're sure to get your money's worth.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

Beach-although it was a bit small, water is very clear . You can clearly see the fish and swim with them. There is enough beach chairs/loungers with shade. Towels are big and newish. There is an area where kids can play and create sand castles cos they provide shovel toys, etc...

Swimming pools- be careful you might get lost cos it's big, hehe. There is an area for kids. Sometimes you will want to think twice which way to go-pool or beach. Both are awesome!

Other activities-you can think about anything and they mostly have it. I am with my nephews and they did enjoy the play area and yes, the pool.

Breakfast/Lunch- has an array of dishes, local and international. Although, I wish they can have a bigger area for this because it is crowded especially during weekends. I wanted to have another serving of that Korean dish, but I have to battle it out. I changed my mind. Yummy sushis.

Service-whenever we ask for ice, they gave us a pail of ice! :)

Dislikes

Directional signs-since it was being renovated at the time when we were there, it will be very helpful to have a lot of signs. Took us sometime to find our room. We went to 2 buildings before we found it.

Check in/out-can be bit difficult due to the number of guests.",Comfort & Facilities
"I went to this resort last two weeks ago for a wedding. Stayed in their One Bedroom Suite with club floor access. For an old resort, it's well kept, clean and maintained. Service is impeccable, food in all the restaurants were good. Club floor was pretty ok, good selection of wine, we even had our own buttler. Overall i must say it is very good except when it rained for 2 days, the entrance to the walk in closet had rainfalls too... ofcourse it disturbed our sleep because it was dripping hard on the carpet even if the rain stopped and i had to remove all my clothes from the walk in closet and pack them again...To think this is a Suite! Oh boy!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Cleanliness
"This is my 3rd stay at Shangri-la and everything is still superb from the rooms to service. The room was newly renovated. Room amenities were top of the line. Service is of the highest level. Which is consistent whenever you stay in any Shangri-la propert.

Highlights of the stay
Good service from airport pick up personnel to room attendants.
Well decorated rooms at the club floor.
All day drinks and snacks at the club lounge plus cocktails at night. You don't even need to have dinner because the food they serve during cocktail hour is plenty and very filling.
Nice gym with steam, sauna and jacuzzi.
Delicious food in their outlets.

Downside
The beach is pretty small and can get crowded especially when hotel occupancy is high.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
This was a decadent and luxurious getaway for myself and my husband. We had a lovely 1 bedroom suite on 2nd floor in Ocean Wing with view over the pool out to the water beyond. It was at the quieter end of the complex however still easy stroll to Spa at other end and the Waves bar on the beachfront. We were away for our wedding anniversary and had booked the secluded table on the one small island in the bay area of the resort; unfortunately the rain put a stop to dining outside however the restaurant staff did a marvellous job or transferring a corner table in the restaurant (keeping tables near us empty) scattering rose petals around our table with little tealight candles and dimmed lighting for a very romantic atmosphere. We had a set menu which we were given three to choose from earlier in the day with wine and a complimentary cake to celebrate (although so full from the meal we did take it back to our room for eating the next day). The staff were attentive although not intrusive and very nice menu. Our 'Butler' Bobbi (i did say it was a decadent weekend!) proved very helpful and accommodated our every request. Valeria at the Spa was extremely good at her job and i loved her massage (We had the couples romantic getaway treatment). I would very much like to make this an annual visit.,Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"As newly hired employee my generous boss wanted to treat me and my family for a day out and he chose Shangri-La as their chains are his favorite hotels in the world. He planned it as a surprise at first but really DISAPPOINTED about the telephone operator or the front desk staffs. After calling for 3 days alas, somebody picked up and told him about the rate so on and so forth. The next day, he wanted to confirm the inquiry and move on to reservation but suddenly rates changed from Php2,000.00 to Php3,000.00 per person. Manager confirm that it was really Php3,000.00 what a shame information. He was again DISAPPOINTED again, for bad customer service, so he booked buffet lunch, transfer to a local number and telephone rings forever. DISAPPOINTED I must say, because he don't want to use the word PISSED OFF. Just for booking a lunch buffet he needs 90mins telephone call from the U.S. when in fact he can booked a month long stay in Shangri-La Hong Kong for 5mins. BUT FNB Manager, Tides Supervisor are really accommodating, trying to supplement the other staff lapses and negligence. Over all experience was awesome CREDIT to Tides Restaurant and their Department. This comment is not to harm Shangri-La this hotel is pretty good and at the top of their industry, this comment is to call the attention of the neglecting DEPARTMENT.",Staff:Value for money
"This was the 6th time that I have stayed at this resort and I think that just about says it all. I have stayed at other resorts in the Philippines and in South-East Asia, most of a similar (purported) standard and none have impressed me as much as this hotel has. The Shangri-La would be well advised to use this resort for training purposes for their employees at all their other resorts.

I have also previously stayed at the Maribago Bluewater Resort on Mactan and the saving in cost was definitely not worth it.

Check in was again done in the room which was beautiful (seaview), the swimming pools and the private beach are clean and spotless and the food in the various restaurants is of a high standard...even in the main food hall where the buffets are served.

The staff went out their way to make this a great holiday and frankly, I cannot think of a single thing, from being collected at the airport to checking out that was a less than very, very good.

A hint for those travelling with young children. You don't have to use the normal hotel laundry service. There are self service washing machines and dryers on the same floor as the reception....not easy to find and not advertised (as far as I am aware). A much cheaper alternative if you have lots of washing !",Food:Staff
"I will keep this short! my review is nothing different from those posted below. But just one very important point, this is very much a family resort, lots of kids running around etc, No, they did not bother me much, but for couples looking for some quiet time, then keep this in mind. But then again the property is fabulous, so you may want to compromise.
The rooms are huge and well lit, we stayed at the Ocean Wing, but it was overlooking the gardens, premium toiletries from L'occitane and the bath was spacious. Really nothing to complain about, but then again nothing out-of-this-world to gush about.
The service was as expected fantastic and food was good. We tried Tides as well as their inhouse restaurant Aqua and they did not dissappoint. At Aqua you must try their ""3 pasta selection"" for mains, it was amazing!!
The morning buffet breakfast selection at Tides was great! But the selection is also such as to cater to their clientele i.e Japanese, Korean and Chinese tourists, but that doesnt mean the Western/international spread was anything less.
We didnt feel the need to go on a snorkelling trip outside the resort, as they have their inhouse marine sanctuary with a pretty impressive variety. Snorkelling equipment can be rented for 300 pesos ( i think) though they say it is for an hour, we used it for over 5 hours and they did not charge us for it. Please note I am an elementary snorkeller, so was content with this.
The hotel is very close to the airport so their free shuttle (depending on your package it is free) was great!
Their private beach though small, is EXTREMELY clean and well maintained, including the sun beds and cute private cabannas/tents. Though small it retains its exclusivity.
Safety first, as they have life guards always on the lookout, and even have a speed boat stationed in the middle in case of any emergency.
We did venture out to the city, and decided to have a local dinner at Sukutil- Manna Restaurant. You purchase your live fish and they cook it for you Phillipino style, meal was very average and the price we paid for was just a few hundereds pesos less that eating at Aqua ( Italian)Shangrila, would recommend to eat at the hotel and save yourself the disappointment.
In short if you are going to Cebu, must stay at the Shang...dont venture out at all, there is no need... it was a fantastic stay!!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"We had read all the positive reviews and heard from friends who have stayed at this resort. So it seemed like a safe bet to book our winter holiday here. We even suggested that another family join us during the holiday. And all nine people in our big group -- including five kids aged 3-10 -- had a fantastic time.

The beach exceeded our expectations (no, it's no Boracay, but still beautiful and great fun). Plenty of marine life in the private bay. And even during peak holiday season, didn't feel over crowded. Pools were the same (less the marine life).

Food was great and with breakfast buffet included, daily spending on food wasn't exorbitant.

The only complaint we could come up with was that the room we got had recently been renovated. So while it looked beautiful, it still had some of the that new room smell which led us to keep the sliding glass doors open for much of the day.

Our kids still talk about some of the fun things they did there. We will definitely go back!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"A very beautiful resort with excellent amenities. Great staff. Delicious breakfast buffet. The employees are very courteous and always willing to help. I have been to many resort hotels here in the US but this one is on the top of my list right now. When in Cebu, make sure you stay here. Expensive for locals but well worth it for about 200-250 dollars/night. Unbeatable!",Food:Staff:Location
"The staff
I've been to a number of resorts but none beats (to-date) the service provided by Shangri-la Mactan. From the front desk to concierge all the way to housekeeping and the staff in Tides restaurant and Adventure Zone - one word: excellent! They are courteous, helpful and customer-oriented. We are a big group (12 in all) and they try as much as they can to accommodate us - by lugging our luggage (which is a lot), getting us rooms near each other and by finding us a big table that will fit all of us during dining.

The resort
Shangri-la Mactan is an all-in-one resort - they have beaches with activities for snorkeling and kayaking. They have a number of pool with slides. They also have an indoor play area for kids where they can run around, climb ropes, slide and join activities like sand-art painting. This is ideal for families where they can leave their kids for a few hours and enjoy some quiet time.

"We stayed in the Ocean Wing on the Ocean Club floors - the package was perfect for my son and I as we were diving everyday. We had early breakfast and early supper. The club facilities gave us the extra space in staying in the hotel and the free drinks were great, plus the free aport pick up/drop off and laundry all helped. The breakfast buffet at Tides was swamped from 07.30 so go early or have it in bed!
The pool and poolside service was very good, Had several nights in the Ezone playing pool. we did however venture further afield for our diving as we got a much better deal outside the resort.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"This is a very nice resort style hotel and the staff are pleasant and work hard BUT...
It is NOT the place to go for a relaxing couples getaway. That is if you don’t want to be confronted at every turn by the atrocious behaviour of Junior Park and Junior Yamamoto.
The place is awash with badly behaved Japanese and Korean kids of all ages and their adoring parents who indulge these brats and even take their photographs and videos as they run riot and generally make normal people’s lives hell. And yes they were all Japanese and Koreans I recognised the languages spoken.
Rooms were OK I wouldn’t really go stronger as mine, though VERY expensive and big was badly in need of refurbishment.
To avail oneself of the sea view that was promised you could stand on a chair or squat down and peer through railings.
Housekeeping was OK, airport pickup worked fine.
Check in was fairly painless and check out was OK except the guy who did it had no clue as to why my account was incorrect. He just mumbled and kept saying “Siiir this your bill”. I was actually trying to tell him they had undercharged me but I confidently expect to see the mealy mouthed email telling me my card has been further debited any day now.
The Chi Spa was very pleasant and thank God a true kid free zone!!
The resort is BIG and does have areas reserved for kids but of course Mum and Dad can’t be bothered complying with any rules whatsoever so everywhere you go the screaming babies are there hurling food, spitting it out throwing it on the floor and generally being a pain.
The wild younger boys and girls run around and barely look as they crash into you and even body surf across the dining room floors.
Then the surly teenagers walk around with Ipads, Iphones and ear pieces and No manners crashing barging in front to board lifts into you and never saying a word of apology.
The hotel is in many ways to blame. They have a policy (they say) of one restaurant Cowrie Cove being an adult environment. I ate there and the food was good. The Japanese kids on table adjacent and behind were less good. Father of brat even indulged in a raspberry blowing contest with junior and when junior hurled the glass of water and ice from baby chair onto table he even applauded!!
The hotel treats and cleans the pools every night and its clearly posted in several languages and they erect a cordon around the pools with notices every 20 metres. This really doesn’t stop the maniac children from throwing themselves in to the pools (sadly they do manage to get out without drowning or chemical poisoning). Its sad to watch the staff having to bite their tongues and have to grin and bear it. Ditto serving staff in restaurants who dice with death carrying crockery and food and have to constantly swerve to avoid these hooligans.
If you say no kids then mean it !
The Italian restaurant, Acqua was pleasant enough for lunch but the whole environment was spoiled by incessant screaming and food littering the floor from a Korean “little darling”.
Tides is a living nightmare, if you have ever read of plagues of locusts, then you can experience it at every breakfast and dinner in Tides.
The poolside bar Buko is pleasant and has a varied menu. Be careful if you want to tip (note that there is already a hefty service charge included in all bills by the way). I wanted to give my waitress some Pesos as a token of thanks. She brought the bill and politely stepped to one side while I signed it. Then out of nowhere a staff member appeared who was (unlike the rest) dressed in green. He seemed to have no useful function other than to hang around asking annoying questions like, “is the food OK” “ is that the correct drink”, “do you want ice in your beer?” and other nonsense. He didn’t actually serve or do anything or even take orders. He picked up the bill and the tip and when I told him “Hey that’s hers” Incredibly he gave her the pen which was inside the folio!
I was obliged to re-tip the hard working Joan while this vulture vanished with my Pesos!!
Note to Mummy and Daddy don’t allow your child to take 5 Kg of food (mixing desserts and savouries in one unholy mess) then liberally toss it all over restaurant this doesn’t endear them or indeed you to other guests or indeed the staff.
OK so if this is a 1950s style Butlins holiday camp in Cebu then so be it but at least tell “normal travellers” i.e. those without brats that it’s not fit for adult occupation.

We stayed in the Ocean Club which keeps you away from the rather busy breakfast areas. The gym is rather good and the restaurant are excellent. The last time I stayed for one night on a business trip and found it so-so.Had to wait for the car at the aiport and got dropped (around 730pm) at the entrance to the Ocean Club. Good that I had been there before as you need to know where to go to get checked-in. The meal at the Italian restaurant was OK but I somehow noticed that this is more of a vacation place.

"We loved every minute of our stay! As expected from Shangrila chain of Hotel & Resorts, rooms, location, amenities are great! For a mother traveling with a baby like me, it does not come easy. Staying at Shangrila Mactan made it not only easy but enjoyable too! You're family will be overwhelmed with the choices of pools to swim (aside from the beach). My 1 year & 4 month old who was initially afraid of swimming, enjoyed the kids pool! There's also big playrooms where you can bring your child to play whenever they get bored or tired walking in the vast grounds of the Hotel.

What's greater is the service! All staffs are genuinely smiling & accommodating. With it's size, you can really get lost. Just ask anyone of the staff & they will gladly accompany you to where you intend to go. Or they will be sincerely concerned to give you beach towels & toys without even asking.

"I was staying at the Shangri-La Mactan Resort and Spa Hotel from 29-Jun to 2-Jul. The hotel is terrific with everything you can dream of in a 5 star beach side resort. The marine scantuary has lots of coral and fishes which I don't get tired of snorkleing all day and everyday. I am perfectly happy with the staff and the hotel. However, this one incident at my departure really ruin the whole thing.

I took the 9:30am hotel airport shuttle to the Cebu airport. When the shuttle stopped at the Philippine Airline gate, me and my boyfriend got off the shuttle bus, which is normal and reach for the trolley to get our luggages. However, when we turn around, we realize the shuttle bus had closed the door and did not off load our luggage. I tried to bang on the shuttle and there are local people helping us to try and alert the driver, but the shuttle continue without any sign of stopping.

I ran after the shuttle for about 5 mins and was about to gave up. Luckily, there was a group of Japanese getting off the shuttle in the next gate. I quickly ran up to the shuttle and the driver did not even realize what happend to me. They off loaded all luggages as if everything is normal. I stood there getting my luggages, really wanted to go up and punch the driver, but obviously they cannot speak English. So, I decided to save my breath and do a complaint instead.

I think this is unacceptable and really made one of my nightmare came true. I am a frequent traveller and this is the frist time I experience such horrible ordeal.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"The Shangri-la experience was definitely on in Mactan. We celebrated our 10th year wedding anniversary there for a weekend and it was awesome. Friendly staff, nice pool and feeding the fish in the morning on the beach was really something else. My daughter had a great time as there were lots of activities aside from swimming to keep her occupied. I would suggest to stockpile on food if you don't want to spend too much on the hotel restaurants. A 10am breakfast would hold you well into the afternoon and then you can decide where to eat. Would definitely go back again.",Food
"It's Shangri-la - what do you expect? Well, for starters I knew what to expect: over-priced rooms, good and thorough house-keeping, well-maintained lawns and facilities and friendly staff. Yes, I got all these. It's what one would normally anticipate in international hotels such as Shangri-la - but they certainly made my expectations seem basic and normal!

Upon arriving, my partner and I walked into the hotel and situated ourselves quite far off the check-in counter to drop off our bags. We were quickly followed by a staff bearing cold and delicious drinks to welcome us. At the reception, aside from the ladies being all beautiful, they were all polite, professional but maintained certain warmth that I immediately felt less conscious and more at home. Right then and there, I decided to sign up for a membership. The check-in was smooth and before long, we were being escorted to our room. We only had a Garden View Deluxe Room and though it was expensive, the room amenities and the furnishing more than made up for it. And the TV - it was just huge! The bed - I didn't want to be anywhere else. The room was just exquisite...everything you would want to have in your own room. After all it is Shangri-la. Imagine excellence and you have the picture. They even provide a shuttle service to and from the malls in Mandau, Cebu City (100 per transfer - not bad!).

I cannot say enough great things about this place. It is sheer luxury. From the well-manicured lawns, the structure, the facilities, the pool (great for all ages!), the ambience, the beach and all the way to the tinniest detail, it was impossible not to marvel at it all. Simply put, I was in love. I felt like a kid in wonderland, eager to try out everything - which is exactly what I did.

Writing about my experience can never give enough justice to this resort. If you want to understand what I mean - then book your stay.

"My favorite hotel is Shangrila. I always choose to stay in Shangrila whenever we have a trip in or out of the country. But Shangrila in Mactan Cebu is the 2nd worst Shangrila I've ever stayed in. We went there last April 2012.
FOOD: It was great!
LOCATION: Not good for me because it is situated near schools and PR houses but close to Lapu Lapu Shrine
ROOM: Terrible. Worst of all. Smelt like damped. Even I sprayed my perfume it didn't take away the smell. The hotel is like a school. It does not really look like a hotel. Surroundings are great like the garden and restaurants but if you look at the rooms, the hotel itself, oh, you will realize you're like going to a school. Small rooms, small and not 5 star reception at Ocean Wing. Toilet bowl not fixed when we arrived.
POOL: It looks good at first sight but when you look at the tiles, it's like tiles in the kitchen that has molds around it.
BEACH: I don't really like the beach. I am not really into a beach where you can see a school of fish on the shore. And there is a big signboard from Shang stating fishes that you might encounter during your swimming. And listed there the fishes that are not Yes, the beach is private but there is one thing that we found out. On our way out from the hotel, we saw that the beach in Shangrila is connected to the public beach which has floating trash around and stilt houses on the side. Aside from that it is rocky on the shore. You might take your slippers on.
SERVICE: and here's the worst thing of all, the lifeguards there are very unfriendly. If you are not a foreigner, you have to go their restaurant to buy your own drinks. Self-service in short but if you're a foreigner they are very keen and attentive. Acqua restaurant is the worst. And aside from that they never change your wet towels. I have to squeeze my towel to make it dry since the towel area is just too far from the beach. The staff there just walk around and enjoying the sun. I requested for a towel and it takes years to come so we finally decided to get it by ourselves.
RESTAURANT: the best is the Cowrie Cove. Worst is Acqua.
MALLS: Too far from Malls. You have to cross the bridge to got to SM Cebu and Ayala Mall. They have shuttle bus but you have to pay it for around 200 pesos. (actually I forgot the price)

And everybody is consistent. Its just something that you wont get in any other place in the world. From the housekeeper to the frontdesk to the security personel, all of them made our stay an exceptional one. One time I called for a bucket of ice, the operator did called me up several times to make sure that i got what i needed. This is what is ""service at its best"" means.The facilities are at par with world class standards. They are well maintained.

"Brought my mom for a mother's day weekend. We stayed in the Ocean Wing. The hotel was packed but we only felt it when we checked in. We were able to enjoy breakfast in relative quiet and find our spot on the beach or by the garden. It helped that Sunday mass was scheduled in a quiet corner so we didn't have to leave the resort.

"It was my first stay at the Shangri-La Mactan resort and I must say I was pleasantly surprised.

I'll start with the staff, they were amazing, they try to accommodate your every request. We only stayed for 3 days 2 nights and already by the second day it seemed like every staff member knew us. Whether it was at the gym for an evening workout, or at their multiple restaurants around the resort the staff knew exactly what we wanted before we even had to ask. Every single staff member we passed would greet us good day. I am an avid traveler and this service was like nothing I had ever seen before. The room we stayed in was great, there are some reviews on here that say that the rooms need upgrading, but I didn't notice anything in particular, and we were in a ""non-refurbished"" room.

The food was great, I looked forward to the buffet dinner at tides every night because they always had something different and the food was always delicious - especially the dessert! It always had an assortment of different types of food, not only those native to the Philippines.

Most importantly, their beach is beautiful - white sand, crystal blue water. The area is a marine sanctuary so I would highly recommended renting some snorkeling gear from the resort, there are so many different types of marine life that you will encounter just steps from the shoreline. They also have fish feeding on monday, wednesday and fridays - if you are a non-swimmer, this is great because all the fish will come to you!

If you are a scuba diver, this resort is very convenient as it has it's own dive shop right on the premises, just steps from the beach. It offers many different types of dives including certification courses.

You will never get bored on a resort like Shangri-La, as they offer so many different daily activities - some at an extra charge (scuba diving, banana boat, ski doo etc.) or free of charge (yoga, jogging club, introduction to scuba diving in the swimming pool, swimming lessons etc.) Their grounds are also very large and gated that you can take long scenic walks/jogs through the nature paths with ease of mind. I also highly recommend making use of their spa facilities, it is truly a relaxing place to be!

The only negative feedback I have about this resort is that when we stayed here (May 2012) they were doing a lot of renovations in the waiting area for the elevators on our floor - thankfully there was a door separating this area from the hallway leading to the rooms and we weren't bothered by the sounds or smells, but every time we needed to get to the elevators we had to hold our breathes as to not inhale the varnish odors or the dust/wood particles in the air. Although, I do understand that this work is all necessary in the up keep of the hotel.

3 days wasn't long enough to enjoy and take full advantage of what the Shangri-La Mactan has to offer. I will definitely be returning to this resort soon and I highly recommend it if you are considering a trip to Cebu.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"The beach looks amazing! I have no complaints about the food. I love the food in their Chinese restaurant which is tea of springs. It's fresh and had the best lumpia I've ever tasted.

We had breakfast buffet in Tides restaurant and even though their food is excellent, I feel like they are trying to hurry guests to finish their food because there are so many guests. This is unlike my experience in Shangri la Boracay wherein the Vintana restaurant which held the breakfast buffet was very spacious and we didn't feel like they are trying to hurry us.

I enjoyed the tours they had for us though which were outside the resort and in Cebu City. It included a Chinese temple, a church were Magellan supposedly put the cross in the Philippines which marked the start of Catholic religion and a very old house which were preserved to show us what houses looked like during the spanish reign.

The rooms need improvement though, it looks old compared to the rooms in Shangri la Boracay.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay in this resort and I wouldn't mind going back but some things need improvement.",Food
"We had a lovely 4 nights stay at the Ocean Club. 2 adults and 3 kids aged 2-6 years. It is really a 5-star resort. A few points though :-

1. Stay at the Ocean Wing with the view of the pools.

2. Do the mini golf. It was good fun.

3. We had buffet breakfast and buffet dinner as part of the package. That made the Ocean Club deal worth while. The spread at the Tides was good but not great.

4. The Filipino and some Koreans do not queue. Get used to it.

5. Go for lunch or dinner at Restaurant Hola Espana, just outside the hotel. The best tapas and pizza in Cebu and at only 30% of the hotel prices. It was really that delicious. You can take the golf buggy to the restaurant from the hotel lobby.

6. The activities at the Kids Zone are very good. The package included free 2 hour playtime for 2 kids per entire stay. It would be better if it was 2 hours per day. The staff at the counter could perhaps control the kids better. A few of them ran out of the zone and they could not stop them. My kids loved a temp there. I think her name is Rapunzel. Her contract ends in September. She should be offered a permanent job as she is excellent.

7. One major drawback is that there is no sound proofing at all between rooms. We could hear the conversation of the guests next door. They were talking till 3am and we had to complain to the operator before they quietened down.

8. The geckos on the balcony walls are huge.

"My wife, three kids and I stayed the ocean wing panorama room for three days and two nights, after a brief three day two night stay in Bohol. We were treated with the usual warm and attentive service you come to expect from a Shangrila resort or hotel. We informed them about our itenerary and they helped coordinate and arrange everything for our convience. For example, on our second day we left at 3AM to swim with the whale sharks in the town of Oslob, they prepared our packed breakfast and informed us when our van arrived. Another instance was when they recommend activities for my three kids to do: adventure zone (large playground area with a ""drop slide""), mini golf area with historical and geographic sites, and the fish sanctuary and watersports. they informed us of the best times to do such activities. I would recommend to you check your itenerary and ask the staff to help you arrange everything. i have visited Cebu numerous times, but i haven't felt as relaxed and rejuvenated after my previous trips. excellent service and superior facilities, highly recommended!",Staff:Location
"Unbelievably beautiful place to spend time with whole family. Booked 3 rooms at Ocean Club and the extra service quickly given to us made our vacation extremely good. We had Jeannifer Singco, who personally made sure that our accommodation and needs were provided. She is genuinely warm and caring. The private beach is fantastic with many fish that are not afraid of people. The pools, facilities and various water sports contribute to making Shangrila Mactan a perfect experience.

Will definitely stay again at this hotel. My whole family are excited to have another round of Shangrila Mactan experience.",Comfort & Facilities
"For a family vacation this really can't be beat, we stayed in the ocean club that came with breakfast and cocktails from 5 until 7 pm. The room was very dated with a shower that leaked water all over
But it was easy to overlook the small issues because of an exceptional staff and facilities. The beach and pools were stunning and the snorkeling right at the hotel was awesome. The week long stay was very worth the price. I would recommend this hotel for all who have the means.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"The last time that I stayed in this resort hotel was 6 years ago and it has changed a lot. Before, we used to go here almost every year. Currently, the resort hotel is under renovation and some rooms are being renovated and some are already done. The resort is great for families with kids and also friends. Over-all service was good. The only thing that they need to improve is their check-in and check-out process wherein the front desk does not explain well what comes with your room package. It is not critical to us since we frequent here, but I heard many guest asking for clarification during check-out and check-in and heard them saying that it was not explained to them. The food has improve a lot but still needs to improve for it to be very good. Activities for adults and kids are plenty.",Staff
"Big hotel but not too big. Big pool. Great beach. Clean. Only thing is the massage I got was pretty awful, much too hard. Food was ok. All in all a great place. I recommend staying in the hotel resort and not wonder outside. Aso I did catch a terrible terrible pneumonia type of breathing disease either on the plane, or when u got to the Philippines so be very careful! it's not related to the hotel.. Someone must have sneezed or coughed or it's from the water. I couldn't enjoy the holiday. Came here 3 years ago.

However this is a great hotel, as most Shangri la's are. I wouldn't come back to the Philippines any time soon given my experience but this hotel is superb.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
My husband and I first went there in 2008 and again in 2009. We were very satisfied with the premium room although it was rather expensive (about S$500/night during peak period). The marine sanctuary is wonderful and we received fresh mangoes in our room every day that we were there. We went for the 3rd time in 2012 during the CNY period and have to say that i was somewhat disappointed that the premium room has started to look pretty worn off (cost S$600++/night and the resort was fully booked!). Breakfast at the Tides is still as wonderful as ever. Am unlikely to go back there again unless they refurbish the premium wing and start lowering the rates/offer promotions.,Value for money:Food
"probably the best vacation hotel in cebu. being just 45 minutes away from the city, this is the best hotel for people who plan to spend more time relaxing and less time in the malls and the city. you do not have to drive 3 hours and pay twice as much for a room to lounge in a beautiful beach.

it has the widest beach among the other resort hotels in mactan.the price is reasonable, the rooms are nice and the food is great. if your idea of a vacation is to shop or see local sights, get a hotel in the city.",Location:Value for money
"I've always considered this resort to be the best in Cebu. Overall, I would say that this is still a great place to stay in. However, management would do good to note the exceptions listed below and urgently do something about them...

Let's start with...

What was EXCELLENT:

- The private beach is amazing, especially now that they've expanded it (I think) and that they've cultivated a marine sanctuary just off the beach where you can go snorkelling. Good job in developing eco-tourism. Not only are they doing themselves a favor, they are doing good to Mother Nature as well...Good effort is also noted in the way they try to educate the public on their marine sanctuary as evidenced by a board listing all the fish that one might see when snorkelling.

- The Ocean wing pool and the waterslides around the main pool for kids were nice additions. My neices had so much fun playing and swimming there.

- The manicured gardens and landscapes around the resort were still very well-maintained.

- Had dinner at Tea Of Sping on our first night. The food was very, very good.

- The E and Adventure zones are good for those travelling with kids, especially when you want to get away from the heat. They have a good selection of activities for kids, games (like billards, Wii) and even a small arcade where there is a variety of videogames.

What was GOOD:

- Airport pick-up and welcome were efficient. Upon arrival, we proceeded to the Shangri-La lounge with my baby while my companions picked-up the luggage. The lounge provided us with a place to relax (there's a TV and some magazines) while waiting for the shuttle. After a few minutes of tagging the luggages and waiting for the other guests get all their stuff, we were off to the resort. The driver was nice and there was even Wi-Fi on the bus.

- Buffet at Tides was good... Loved the Indian selections.

- The restaurant by the beach is a nice place for happy hour, although there were a lot of mosquitoes.

- If it weren't for some plumbing issues in the bathtub (the water drained very slowly), the renovated rooms were very nice, even excellent. Nice comfy beds, flat screen and balcony with amazing views of the Mactan Channel.The baby cot provided for my son was also in excellent condition - even branded - Graco.

What COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER - for the price that we paid and the reputation of the hotel, attention to detail and excellent customer service are paramount. These were the 2 major pain points of our stay.

- After check-in, no one escorted us to the rooms. The staff should have been proactive enough to realize that, because of the on-going construction in the hotel, the guests would have to pass a different way to get to the rooms and this might confuse them. They should have escorted all their guests to their rooms. We had a hard time finding the rooms and had to ask a hotel employee where they were. The thing that made this experience even worse was that we were travelling with my son (a 7-month old infant) and my Mom who was in a wheelchair...Not exactly Shangri-La standard of service...

- Before the trip, I reserved 3 seaview rooms and the hotel confirmed this in writing via email. Upon arrival, there were only 2 seaview rooms available and the other room that was given to us was one facing the garden. We tried to get a room transfer and even explained that the reservation was confirmed for 3 seaview rooms. They were unable to do anything about it since the hotel was fully booked (according to them). What's worse was that they did not offer anything substantial to us as compensation for their error...A big disappointment for a Shangri-La hotel...

- The wheelchair given to my Mom was very rusty. Rusty wheelchairs = Shangri-La?

- There was a lady passing by when were were on the beach who asked us if we needed towels. We were grateful and we said yes...but she never came back with the towels.

I hope to write a much better review in the future as I really love this resort and I hope management reads my post and corrects these exceptions as soon as possible. I also took the survey to let them know what they should address ASAP.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"This is by far the nicest hotel in Cebu. The rooms are nice, clean and comfortable, but what really makes the hotel superb are the fantastic grounds! Beautiful pools, lawns, beach and tropical vegetation make this truly a unique experience. The only downside is the location which is a long way from the city, but the place is so beautiful that you don't really want to leave anyway!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Cleanliness
"spent a short 3 day trip in one of the best beach resort in cebu. the refurbished deluxe ocean view rooms were really great. the resort gave you the choice of two areas to have a fully arranged buffet breakfast complimented with prompt service. the hotel provided you also with a clean white sand private beach, two large pools, a golf link, a top class spa and gym, recreational facilities for kids, numerous restaurants and snack outlets and a shuttle service to the city center... among others. a quick half day city tour or a whole day trip to neighboring bohol or a fantastic island hopping and diving adventure can be arranged for you by the resort. 5 star comfort plus superb service added to a wonderful itinerary certainly makes a stay in shangri-la mactan worth all the money.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This is hands down the best beach hotel in Cebu. It is also a great example of a large beach resort done right. This is the type of place where you go and stay at the resort the whole time, and you don't feel bad about not exploring the island.

We have been here twice as a couple without children and although there are lots of children around you can still have a romantic holiday.

The beach is just wonderful (but is a bit small) with chairs, umbrellas, and a swimming area with swimming platforms. The water is crystal clear and perfect for snorkeling. The pool by the water is the best and is very relaxing.

The rooms are just okay but honestly you are not in them much. We stayed in the executive level the second time and the included breakfast was worth it. Service is pretty good and they go out of their way for anything special. (For instance my husband proposed here with a lot of help from the staff to make it the most amazing surprise.)

The spa is a 5-star experience, which is part of the reason why we returned. Private pools, private treatment rooms, an extensive number of treatments to choose from, private outdoor baths and showers, and some of the best therapists around. Small touches count. One time they noticed it was my birthday and gave me a signature eye mask to take home.

The restaurants are also good but the best is the one on the water, with the best lobster curry ever. You can also do private dining on the beach, which is such an amazing experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We chose the hotel after reading the reviews, and were so glad that we chose this hotel. First of all, we had to change our booked dates, and even though we had booked online through a room booking site that stated we would have to forfeit the cost of one night in order to change the booking, the hotel management arranged it so that this would not be the case. This was the first of many kindnesses shown by the staff of the Shangri-La, and by staff I mean everyone from the beautifully attired lobby host ladies who greet you with their sparkling smiles all the way through to the waiting staff, the hotel garden staff, the lifeguards, the chambermaids, and the Adventure Zone staff who gave our children such a fun couple of afternoons ... someone mentioned that everyone here seems to be on happy medicine, and I have to agree, but it doesn't in any way come across as artificial. It's a warm and friendly manner that everyone has here, and it makes the guests respond in kind (hopefully). Well done Shangri-La for some incredible staff training, and thankyou to the staff for being so courteous and gracious and understanding and helpful at every moment of every day we stayed there. An incredible experience, and I haven't even started talking about the two beautiful swimming pools, the perfectly manicured garden lawns with tropical flowers and flowering bushes at every turn, the fun little minigolf course, the picturesque pitch and putt, the private coral-filled lagoon teeming with marine life, the delicious food, and the wonderfully relaxing health club, all of them still available to us hours after we had checked out, to keep us entertained while waiting to take our late night shuttle to the airport for our 1am flight. Shangri-La was an expensive treat for us ... but what a treat!",Staff:Food
"Why Shangrila, Mactan? 5 star hotel so we expected the 5 star service, right? Wrong! We arrived at the resort around 2p for our 3 day/2 night stay. Nice greeting at the entrance. Receptionist greets us and sends someone to walk us to our room. The room stank of cigarette smoke and the employee who escorted us disappeared as soon as we started asking about the smell. It turned out to be a smoking room next to a construction and a party area! Anyhow, make story short, we ask for a differerent room and it took them four hours to find another room in their non-smoking tower on the 4th floor (not 7th floor as first suggested because they had a ""Korean tour group"" coming in)! From then on, everytime we passed by the main lobby area, the employees who first greeted us snubbed us everytime (because we had the guts to complain?). Informed Shangrila Mactan management after returning to the States and response was an apology and an offer of a free upgrade for the next visit. HA!
The Hotel, itself is a nice location with great private beaches. White sand, clear turquoise waters with a beach restaurant staffed with wonderful employees! Cocktails are so- so but we loved the food. The Acqua restaurant by the infinity pool is a tranquil place to eat a breakfast buffet. They have two outdoor pools staffed with diligent life guards. Lots of areas for families with kids.
Hotel plus is Scotti's Tour booth by the beach. We took a snorkel tour to Nalusuan Island through Scotti's. We boarded the motorized boat at the hotel pier with a tour guide, her assistant, the boat's captain and two other boatmen. The boat ride itself was amazing with the friendly staff. Once at the snorkel site, one of the boatmen held my hand and guided me to where the schools of fish were, and did the same to each of my other companions. We saw differents kinds of fish and had a great time!
Overall, I might give them another chance but I would definitely inspect the room first before I agree to it. They do need a friendlier, more competent reception staff!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I booked the Shangri-La with some reservations as it's a family friendly resort and we're a couple. (I was swayed by the beautiful pictures and positive reviews.) My 'worries' were unfounded. Sure most were families with young children but there was plenty of space for everyone, even over the long Easter weekend where occupancy looked high; and I believe the staff knew what to do when they assisted us with securing empty chairs on the beach.

And that beach, wow! White sand, clear warm waters teeming with fishes and corals close to shore, it's a beach lover's paradise. The other winning point was Filipino hospitality, which I think played a great part in making our stay relaxing. The staff were ever so genuinely helpful, friendly and cheerful, you can't help but feel chilled. We also went to the spa, Chi, and that itself deserves a full rating.

I'd say the only downside was the food. Everything was a little too salty and didn't taste as fresh as I expected. Ice cream at Scoops was the best thing. The room furnishings, even the ones that are refurbed which we stayed in, could do with a little more polish. But that's pretty minor; nothing that's a deal breaker.

For us to think about returning to a family friendly resort is a big deal but that's how good it is.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Philippine hospitality combined with lots of kids entertainment made this an excellent holiday for us. Really good service, nice room, beach and pool areas. Breakfast is massive but well organized and of good quality. Take away capuchin? No problem, all is taken care of and included in room rate.

"As we got off the plane at the airport, there was a air-conditioned shuttle bus ready to take us to the hotel. Upon arrival, we were all extremely hot and sweaty. As we entered the lobby, a small, refreshing glass of sweet mango juice was given to us, which was a great way to cool us off a little.
We were on the Ocean Club level, on the Ocean Wing, which gave us access to the Ocean Club lounge, where they have drinks, breakfast and evening cocktails. Our room was right next to it, so it was convenient for us to go over and grab a few drinks before we went to the pool or back to our room to watch a movie. We also had all of our dinners there, and the food was great, a lot better than some other club lounges that I've been to.
The pool was also great, although, the water was a bit warm, due to the constant sunlight shining directly on top of it, but it is something easily forgotten about, since everyday is aroun 30 degrees Celcius. It had a water-slide, which was only for 5-12 year olds, so my siblings went on it about 20 times a day, they really seemed to enjoy it. There was also a basketball hoop on the edge of the pool, which gave you a chance to shoot a basket from the water. (Sorry for somewhat breaking the backboard :P) A kid's pool section was also there, which is great for the little ones, because it is always in the shade and shallow.
The beach was a highlight. The Shangri-La has a Marine Sanctuary, which is perfect for snorkelling. There are a lot of different fish in there, and many aren't afraid to come up close to you. My sister got the chance to feed the fish, and there were so many that surrounded us. The Shangri-La also has snorkelling equipment available for hire on the beach (our hire of non-motorised water sports was complimentary, since we were in the Ocean Club). They also offer kayaking, scuba-diving, wind-surfing, jet-skis, and a lot more.
The buffet breakfast was also fantastic. My personal favourite was the fresh grilled squid, but there were many other great dishes. A noodle station, different types of rice, sausages, fish, salad, sushi, and a lot of desserts and fruit juices. The food in general is great, although, we ordered two pizzas from room service, one, which arrived cold, and the other, coming at a different time (about an hour late).
There was also golf. We played the mini-golf, and it was fun, although, it was very hot as we were playing.
If I was to visit Cebu again, I would choose to stay at the Shangri-La. The service is great, the food is great, the rooms were great, the pool was great, the beach was great...everything was great!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Our little family of 4 (2 kids aged 5 & 3) spent 3nights here and we had a blast!
We were allowed an early check in at 9am! Super appreciated this, as we had an early flight,
it gave the kids time to freshen up , take nap.
Our local resident package included free buffet breakfast and 2 hours in adventure zone. Upon check in we were advised there were free complimentary activities for the kids in adventure zone, but when we got there, the free activities were only for those aged 3 y.o below, you will have to pay additional for them to join other the activities. There is a separate play area called toddler zone, unlimited playtime for kids, but the room itself can get really stuffy, and there wasn't any attendant to supervise if the kids/adults are wearing socks. The adventure zone is more well managed, I left my 5 year old here while we took a rest, and they just gave our room a call, when she wants to be picked up.
Beach is small but clean, although getting beach umbrellas can be daunting. A lot of guests seem to reserve the chairs first by leaving their stuff, before heading for breakfast. You can request for fish food, to feed the fishes, the kids loved it! You dont have to go far, to see and feed the fishies. My 3 yr old loved it!
Pool - we spent majority of our time in the Aqua Play Area - its perfect for kids 0-5yrs old. Theres a bigger slide, which my five yr old also enjoyed.
Room- One downside was when we checked in, our sheets had a musky smell, however, 1 call to the housekeeping and they were able to change it asap. They also set up a small extra bed for my 5 y.o., she loved having her own cozy nook.
Food - we mostly hanged out by the pool, so we just ordered pizzas, ice cream, chicken nuggets for the kids. The food can take up to 30-45 mins per order, its reasonably price for a hotel.
Overall, its really a great place to spend quality time, you can lounge on chairs while you watch your kids run around it the aqua water play. The restrooms are all clean, even those on the beach, with an attendant regularly cleaning it. I think the place is perfect to bring your kids, as they will have tons of activities to do, while the parents an also find their own space to relax and unwind.
Be sure to ask the hotel for any ongoing promotions, when we went there, citibank cards get 20% discount on food and room rates",Value for money:Food:Staff
"There's no doubt about it, the Shangri-La at Macton Cebu is very impressive BUT what's even MORE impressive were ALL the staff! I'm sure they've all got silicon chips inside them and programmed to be on happy mode 24/7. At the pedestrian entrance to the hotel is an overhead sign saying ""Thru this pathway pass the most courteous, sincere, respectful, and helpful employees in the world"" and let me tell you this............ every single word of it is TRUE

EVERYTHING comes from their hearts!

While we were there was a refurbishment programme going on but did not cause any inconvenience whatsoever.

If you go there, checkout these 2 employees..........Abigail Anam-Anam - she is with the Pool Butler Team (wearing yellow) and Ghane Mandras - he is with the Pool Bar Team (wearing Blue). Nothing but nothing was too much for these guys and they were such fun to chat with and very knowledgeable.

We stayed 3 weeks at the Shangri-la and ........................... we're definitely going back!!!!!!!!!

WARNING! You might find it best to use the hotel shuttle bus to go into Cebu city which takes about 45 mins and come back the same way because the taxi drivers are so greedy that as soon as you say ""Shangri-la"" (they only see peso's) they try to rip you off by wanting EXTRA to that shown on the meter or not use the meter at all! We refused every time and told them to take it or leave it..........most of them took it with the exception of one driver who asked us to get another taxi. I would suggest that the department responsible for policing these sharks to take appropriate punitive action (there is no way this would be tolerated in the UK) if they want tourists to keep coming back to the Philippines!

I would also recommend a trip to Bohol which is about 1hour 40 mins by Ocean Jet from Pier 1 at Cebu docks.

"This place is really quite amazing: meticulously-kept grounds, beautiful white beaches, extremely friendly staff, great variety of restaurants. The downside for us was the room. The bathtub was chipped, the carpet and love seat stained, and it smelled of old smoke and mildew. I told the staff and they said they would do something to 'freshen it up' but we noticed no difference. The other downside is that they charge you and arm and a leg for small necessities bought at the resort itself...hows $25US for a small bottle of after sun cream? No thanks. Yes, I realize that it's ""The Shangri-La"" but still...people are already paying a lot to stay here so why nickel and dime them on the small stuff? I can only hope some of the profits go to the local population (who live in extreme poverty just outside the gates). Overall though we did have a great time and would probably go back. Everyone was polite and helpful and the whole compound is absolutely gorgeous. Food and drink excellent but of course cost much more than anywhere else on Mactan Island. We didn't bring our daughter but the Shangri-La also looked great for kids. It also had the best breakfast buffet I have ever seen in my entire life bar none. So basically if you don't mind paying a bit extra for food/drink/small items and can get yourself a nice room I would heartily recommend the Shangri-La Mactan.

A few tips: Want an amazing dinner for less? Head 1km. up the road to Abaca. Unbelievable dining experience (the hotel will arrange a car). Want a great massage for half the price of the Shangri-La's Chi Spa? Head 100m up the road to the Tea Tree Spa. Great massages, free mango shake when you're done and a free ride home! We also took the shuttle bus from the hotel (again, for a charge) to the SM mall...a shopper's paradise and definitely worth checking out.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"I have stayed at many 5 star hotels around the world. This is a typical place with many things to do, decent beach, etc. BUT. service is very lacking. We arrived and check in took longer than expected although there were no one else in line. Then we waited for 45 minutes for our luggage to arrive to our room. Which we had to call 4 times. Then we asked for a king size bed but got two twins. They said, ""oh, we can push them together."" We figured that would be ok. So some guy showed up. Pushed them together but instead of get us king size sheet and bed spread, he actually used the two twin sets to makeshift the bed. I commented, ""really?, is this the hampton inn?"". Finally, he said he'd see if it was possible to find us a king room and would get back to us, he never did. So we went out to relax at the beach. We ordered some drinks and food but when we had to pay, They said our room didn't exist. They finally looked up our name and we signed for our food. Then we went up and the key wouldn't work. Finally, I went back to the front desk and they told us they moved all our stuff to a new room. So we went to the front desk, again. They apparently move our rooms but never told us. They even moved our things without asking us. Then realized the didn't move all our stuff. After more work, we got all our stuff back. Finally, we called and asked for later check out since we spent 2-3 hours wasting our evening. They checked and said sorry, check out was 1pm. I laughed and told them when I stay at Hilton or Marriott I not only have NO problems like this place but get 3pm check out. Then had no response. Save your money. Stay somewhere else. By the way, the beach may look nice but be VERY careful. If you go out 10 ft, the rocks are VERY sharp and you can get cut very easily. Sadly, I am NOT impressed with this hotel. Many better places for your hard earned money. Note, there room cleaning staff were good, I asked for more shampoo and they didn't have any on their cart but said they would get more... 10 minutes later, they brought it.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

You can have a relaxing massage in one of the huts, right on the sand and see the calm blue waters and the waves. The daily brunch is international and there is so much to choose from. We had the best New Year's eve celebration with an all night dancing performed by live performers, as well as all night serving of champagne and hors'd'ouvres on the house, for all guests. This was topped off with a fantastic fireworks display. The staff was friendly, attentive and made sure that our stay was comfortable.

The breakfast buffet has a wide selection of food, which was superb. We were delightfully entertained at the dinner buffet at Buko Bar, Filipino Fiesta theme, that comes with a Cultural Show. Our stomach were fully satisfied with their Sushi Mania dinner buffet at Tides.

"Stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in the month of March for my family's annual vacation. This is the 3rd time my family and I have stayed in this hotel and we Love it. The service, facilities and the beach is excellent. Rooms in the Ocean Wing are starting to show some wear and tear and would probably need a make over in the next year or two. Our family booked adjacent rooms with each room able to fit 3 people comfortably (4 per room if you have infants). The beds and pillows are good and guarantees a good night's rest. The hotel's beachfront is not so wide but is enough for kids to run around without getting lost. The beach also serves as a marine sanctuary so bringing bread to the beach shores in the morning is a must for kids as feeding allows the kids to get up close to schools of fish. Kayaking is free and para-sailing, glass bottom boat rides, scuba diving, jet skiing are available for a fee. There is also a game room and play area called Adventure Zone for adults and kids to use. Restaurants in the hotel are ok but on the pricey side, eating outside of the hotel is recommended as there is a small Spanish restaurant that serves good ""Paella"" & pizza just across the road. The hotel offers a free shuttle service that takes you to the city proper where malls with stores and restaurants can be found.

The room was comfortable and spacious, the reception was efficient. My colleagues and I did not eat at the hotel so can't rate the restaurant, but we did entertain some clients in the lounge and found the service excellent.

"We were on a business trip and stayed in this hotel as a jump off point to the Minantaw Marine Park and Sanctuary. It's the only double reef in the Philippines but one of the most exploited fishing area. It's under a rehab program by Proj Seahorse the NGO handling the program.

It's a pity though that we stayed only for one night and didn't have the chance to enjoy much of the facilities. Though I saw that they have 2 very inviting pools. The bigger one has slides and fountains/water falls that are popular with the kids. There are more people here while the other secluded infinity pool has the view of the ocean and seems more quiet, ideal for honeymooners. They also have a mini golf course and a gym. The property is so huge, one can actually run around the pathways.

Their beach cove has white sands. I believe they have their own sanctuary and nemos abound in that contained area. You will definitely enjoy snorkelling. Don't know though if the hotel provides snorkelling kits free of charge.

We had cocktails at the Cowrie Cove while watching the sun set. I got two perfect mojitos, a good deal because it was on buy one take one during happy hours (5-7pm). It's one of the most romantic places here at the hotel property. If you're on a honeymoon, be at this place exactly at 5pm to book the most romantic table.

The room amenities were good as well. Soft beds and pillows, new towels and L'Occitane toiletries, got what we paid for. Wifi was strong in the rooms. There were fruits in the room, and the mangoes were so sweet.

Overall, this resort is very ideal for families. If you're on a honeymoon and would want to have peace, avoid being in the lobby area where it becomes busy especially during lunch time. Could have been the best if there's no additional payment for hotel transfers (P200). They can probably just tack it on the rate per night.

Next time, I'll make sure that at the very least I have my husband with me. So nice to be looking outside my balcony with him.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"If you are after a resort that you don't need to leave, this is it, pretty location, 5 good restaurants, beach bar, private beach, water sports, great spa, many other amenities and with good diving close by.

Cons....it's an expensive place by PI rates. Exploring the city of Cebu would be fine on my own, but with my wife...it gave me some concern...",Location:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"This was our second visit. We decided to come back again for this was the Resort we stayed in during our very first overseas trip together and we had an unforgettable time. We did state in our reservation that we would appreciate if we could have a quiet room and a possible early check-in. Room was not ready upon arrival and we decided to proceed for lunch first. Room was not ready by the time we finished lunch and we waited for another half an hour or so before we were finally allocated a room on the 5th floor, non-airconditioned corridors and rather near to the lift and you can imagine the noise when people walk past our room to the lifts. We hear occasional banging of doors (can't understand why they can't close it softly), children screaming and laughing and the most amazing part was when we hear our next door neighbours and their children making tons of noise at about 6.30am in the morning! So much for a request for a nice quiet room! We decided to request for a room change and was informed that they will try their best to expedite our request. We waited till about 5+pm before we were finally allocated another room. Our plans for the day was ruined for we wanted to make a room change and settle down nicely before heading out. New room was on the 7th floor with a nicer view and was much quieter for it was located far away from lifts. Service was excellent like before and we were always full of praises for the warmth and great service provided by the team here. Service was actually another main reason we returned. Had dinner on our last night at Cowrie Cove. Food was rather disappointing. Ordered prawns but it weren't fresh. If I remembered correctly, the old Cowrie Cove had better lightings and a nicer seating arrangement. It was so dark, we had to request for additional table lamps and yet still have problem seeing what was on the table. And no, we have perfect eyesight. Haha! There are buses (chargeable) to the city area and it is definitely not of Shangri-la standards. There were mosquitoes in it, dirty curtains and seats. I was abit taken aback by the state of it. All in all, it is a very nice resort. Oh! And I must comment that they have the nicest uniforms ever. We might return again some day.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"This is an outstanding resort. The service was truly spectacular. The complimentary breakfast buffet each mornig was the best I have ever seen. The two pools are extremely large. While lounging at the infinity pool near their private beach where you can snorkel the staff walkes by and offered complimentary skewers of refreshing water melon. The resort amenities were outstanding. There are table tennis tables and a pool table in a huge gazebo.
They offer Guests complmentary bottled water that they replenish daily. The bathroom mirror even has an area where it will not fog up.
If you are celebrating your anniversary and inform them they just might have a nice welcome in your room.
The Italian and Chinese Restauranst were both amazing. The food and service were both spectacular and the prices very reasonable.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"The service at this Shang is much better than their Manila & Boracay hotels. However, I found the resort frentic. Crowded with tourists 'competing' for pool/beach space; playing their iPads out-loud and rushing about. So, if you're looking for a relaxing tropical resort experience go to the Shang in Boracay",
"Shangri-la Mactan is one of the best hotel I've ever stayed with. The food are great, their employess and the management itself are very nice and accommodating.

We had so much fun during our stay there. You have the choice to either go swimming in the pools or the sea...go diving and many more.

You can either dine at their buffet area or choose to dine at their First Palace restaurant inside the hotel.

To sum it all, it was a very good and a very memorable experienced staying at Shangri-la Mactan. A very good place for Business review and conferences or for just simply enjoying your personal time with your family or a love one.",Food:Location
"Stayed at this resort for 5 nights in a family room. Rooms were very new and clean and immaculatley presented. Beds were super comfortable and were by far the best beds that we slept on on our whole holiday to the Philippines. Kids had a ball at this resort in the pools and the beach. Beach was glorious and swimming with the fish was a highlight for all. Service at this hotel is fantastic and what you would expect from a 5 star resort. Buffet breakfast that was put on in the main wing would have to be one of the best that I have experieced in my travels , Staff were so accomodating for the kids and even cooked them chicken nuggets and penne bolognaise for my son when this was not being served at the buffet the first night. Hotel is on the expensive side so watch your spending as ou room service bill was $900 AUD for 6 days however it was all worth it for the great time we had at the resort. We ventured into Cebu city a couple of times to the shopping centres and these felt safe and we wernt looked at for being foreigners as much as in other parts of the Philippines. SHopping malls in CEBu reminded me a bit of SIngapore. Would definately recommend this hotel even for the most fussiest traveller",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"I stayed at the Shangri-La Mactan in September 2011 on business and was very impressed with all aspects of the resort. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The hotel staff is extremely friendly and very willing to assist with special requests. The location and beach are awesome. Private beach with lots of stuff to do. Beach restaurant, water sports rentals (wave runners, snorkeling, hobie cats, and more). Great snorkeling right from the beach - calm water, coral/rocks, and tons of fish. Very nice gym. I wish I had my kids with me because the play area and big pool looked great.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Stayed recently for team meeting (wish it was a vacation instead of business trip). The resort was amazing huge with all kind of activities for entire family - young and old alike.

Room that I stayed in was almost perfect - furnishings n fittings kinda worn out (old) but still almost perfect. Anyway, when u r here, u will be crazy to spend most of your time in the room as there are tons of activities - mini golf, golf, scuba diving, snorkeling, sea-trekking (must try for those yet into scuba), kayaking, water activities aplenty...beach volleyball, fantastic pools, giant chess set and many more... For those with small children.. Check out their indoor 2 Floor (levels) playgrounds.

Food wise - wonderful. Plenty of choices - buffet or nice cozy candle light dinner, etc... You can even party at the many beach bars in the resort. Probably may have added a few kilos while staying here ;p

Too bad it was a business trip. Will return one day for my long overdue fun, sunny time on the beach.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We visited the resort for the 5th time in January with our children aged 4 and 5. The overall experience is still the best we have experienced for a family vacation in Asia, only comparable resort was the JW Marriot in Phuket. The staff are always friendly and helpful, the kids club is well above the standard yuo would normally expect, Scotty's dive centre which is located onsite is the most professional dive centre I have used in any resort in Asia during our holidays.

The resort rooms could use an upgrade and it looks like the decsion has been made to invest in the facilities ahead of the rooms from what we have seen, while expensive you get what you pay for and overall we believe the resort is good value for money.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"One of the best hotels I have stayed in the Philippines. They have their own private beach which is very good since its not crowded. The beach is not Boracay but its still really good and clean. We rented a jetski here and we really had a great time. We stayed here for a conference / company vacation and from the moment we stepped out of our bus, we were greeted with a traditional dance from a group of costumed dancers. That really made an impression. The hotel itself has an airy and outdoor atmosphere which I like. I really dont like the airconditioned, urban feel of other hotels especially when you want an escape from everyday office work. If you're staying here or any place in Cebu, you have to go snorkeling at Nalusuan. Its just a boatride away and its really amazing. I could swim all day with the warm waters and beautiful corals. I dont dive but I'm sure the diving spots here are one of the best in the country from what others were telling me. Overall, my Cebu ""vacation"" has been made that much greater by Shangrila Cebu. Will definitely go back here again.",Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We have stayed at the Shangri-la several times over the years and we always yearn to go back. The service at this resort is not consistently perfect but it certainly is a cut above the rest. Check-in is usually swift for us since we usually arrive way past the standard check-in time but the counters can be busy in the mornings and at noon. I love that they now placed a kids' lounge in the lobby so the children won't get bored waiting while checking in. My daughter quickly noticed the lounge and rushed to play with the toys. Hopefully they would add more toys and books in the future.

During the time we stayed there, they had just completed the room renovations in one part of the hotel. We availed of the local resident's rate and expectedly, we were not assigned a renovated room since they charge more for it. Although the room is showing signs of age, it is clean and everything works. I have nothing to complain about. I would love to try out the renovated rooms next time. I also received a personalized letter welcoming me back to the resort. It is also worth noting that they now offer free broadband and wifi. The wifi is relatively new since they only had free wired internet the last time we were there. Their internet speed is super fast!

Shangri-la has the best beach in Mactan. We love lounging by the beach in the afternoons and my daughter loves to play in the sand. The resort has a toddler and kids' zone which are indoor play areas should the kids get tired of the pool and beach. We have yet to try the toddler zone since my kid prefers the pool and sand over anything.

For dinner, Cowrie Cove is the choice if you want to be near the water or you want a place that is romantic. I prefer going to Tides though because I find the menu in Cowrie Cove limited. Tides offers quite a buffet spread that even picky eaters and kids will surely find something they like. I especially love their creme brulee! For me, it's the best creme brulee in Cebu! I simply can't get enough of it.

The lobby lounge also has a band playing every night. My daughter loves music and even when she was still 1 year old, she loved listening to the band. She's now 3 and is a joy to watch when she would sing or dance along. We would make it a point to bring her to the lobby lounge whenever we were in Shangri-la. Nothing beats listening to live music while sipping our drinks and letting the cool sea breezes blow our cares away.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I first visited this hotel 10 + years ago in my teens with my Mum and Dad. Have to say that it has since improved and better than i remembered it. This visit I had taken my 3 year old and decided a relaxing beach resort would be ideal. Its only 15 minutes away by car from the international airport.

Firstly the hotel offer renovated rooms, we stayed in the newly renovated ocean wing rooms, the rooms are comfortable and it has a built in extra bed mounted against the wall so when its not in use it looks like a wardrobe. Apparently not all rooms offer this so you need to request this in advance. The rooms are comfortable but I did manage to sneek a peek of the old rooms and they do look tired but If I would go again I don't think I would be too bothered since we spent most of our time by the beach.

The Food & Beverage at this hotel is excellent a brillant choice for breakfast. We sat outdoors most of the time as indoors was busy and noisy. Only problem is that the area outdoor is fly infested and they can be annoying after a while. We had the buffet dinner which offers a good selection however if compared to the Shangri-la in Hong Kong it could improve. Cowrie Cove for dinner was nice, offers a relaxing ambience and they also have a kids menu.

The beach is brillant in fact we spent everyday by the beach. From how i remembered it 10 + years ago the hotel has done an excellent job in caring for the marine life and the place was made into a sanctuary from 2006. If you are with small children recommend you take bread from the buffet breakfast and go down to the beach and feed the fish. We took our 3 year old on a Kayak every morning and she enjoyed feeding the marine life. There are hundreds of fish. Snorkeling around the beach is also very good, the water visibility is excellent we saw parrot fish, clown fish, clams, abalone, eel, angel fish, lion fish.

The hotel also provides spades and buckets for kids at no cost so they play in the sand. The staff are attentive and are amazing at remembering our names.

I would say if you are looking for a short getaway with kids. This is it. Short trip from the airport, clean pristine water and great hospitality. The hotel is not cheap but I felt its worth every penny.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Shangrila Mactan Resort is just less than an hour's drive from Cebu City and a few minutes away from Mactan International airport. Whenever we want to have a relaxing and pleasant stay, this resort is our top priority. Staying here makes you fell like you're in paradise. You can just stay here the whole day or more and enjoy the many amenities that this hotel offers. It has a spa area with pool. Eating is not a problem as they have Tides restaurant, Aqua, Cowrie Cove and Tea of Spring to choose from. We love the beach where the water is so clear that you can see the fishes and feed them, too. The infinity pool is also a favorite, aside from the other big pool where you can play some water sport games. The hotel has lovely and clean room with toilet amenities. Hotel lobby also has boutiques and convenience store. Hotel has shuttle bus service to and from the major malls in the city.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Overall, I was very pleased with my experience at the Shangri-La. The resort is excellent for families, though the resort works for couples as well. If business is your first priority, then I would not recommend this hotel as many amenities (e.g. a proper work desk in your room) might not be convenient or available.

There are two pools -- one designed for family fun and a second that is quieter and geared toward relaxing adults. The private beach is excellent and includes a coral reef and fish sanctuary. The restaurant servers on the beach and by the pool were a bit lacking, however, and it was often something of a chore to get their attention.

There are several restaurants, though only one is suitable for a romantic dinner (Cowie Cove -- it overlooks the ocean). The others are geared more toward family dining.

An Excellent Example of Service:
At one point, my wife became ill (completely unrelated to the hotel), and the hotel's in-house nurse worked hard to make her more comfortable. Without our asking, the nurse coordinated with room service to provide soup and gatorade for my wife, which was a much appreciated gesture.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Went to shangrila mactan with our 20month old baby, who enjoyed his stay very much.

1)Service was great, the staff were very friendly and well trained

2)Food- we tried the food at the tides and it was really good, breakfast had a number of choices and my son ate free for all the meals

3)stayed at the premiere gardenview-2nd floor ocean wing
the rooms are abit tired already, its carpeted but part of the room had a smell, to fix the smell they placed a humidifier in the room and it worked okay...My brother was staying at the the deluxe seaview room (newly renovated) I liked it much better as it didnt have any carpet in it thus no smell and the views were much better

they were very generous with the complimentary water and use of towels.

3) they had a kids place called adventure zone and another for toddlers called toddler zone-- bring socks for both parent and kid/s to be able to use the facility",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"The Good
1. Beautiful Beach (white sand)
2. Housekeeping cleaned our room and replenished our supplies twice a day
3. Free shuttle to airport and city center (only till 5pm though)

The Bad
1. Overpriced car rental and restaurants
2. Bay view and Garden view rooms are exactly the same but they charge more for the Bay view room
3. Half-board is more expensive than paying for the $30 dinner (per night)

The Ugly
1. Management doesn't allow front desk to call taxi for guests (yes you read that one right) and they don't allow taxi to enter the hotel property unless they have passengers staying at the hotel.
2. Hotel employees. Asked personal questions throughout our stay. Especially this one employee who harassed my gf while I was outside the hotel property trying to get taxi. It was after 5pm and the shuttle service was no longer available. I know they're probably just trying to be friendly but they can't seem to differentiate between casual convo vs prying.
3. Atmosphere. There are armed guards throughout the hotel. Exactly what are they trying to protect us from? Is it that dangerous outside? It made us feel secure however we felt unsure about leaving the property.
4. The clientele. People staying here seem to be a bit uncivilized. On more than one occasion men between 50's and 60's gave my gf inappropriate stares.",Staff:Value for money

"I dont know where to begin! From the moment we were picked up at the airport (most organized, easy and efficient airport pick-up I've ever had) to the moment we checked in at the Airport, the service of the Shangri-La Mactan was amazing! We were greeted car side upon arrival, walked directly to our room (a perk of staying in the Ocean Club as a Golden Circle Member I believe) and did check-in in the room. Because we are a family of 4 and wanted room to spread out we decided to try the Suite. We had a Panorama Suite, it was wonderful. The hotel is a bit older but updated and incredibly well maintained and immaculately clean. With our suite we were given a complimentary Butler (which was an awesome surprise)! We chose to eat breakfast in the Ocean Club Lounge each morning because it is more quiet and less hectic. It was perfect for us. Some people perferred a bigger selection and went to the Tides Restaurant or Aqua. Both were excellent. There were TONS of awesome activities for the kids, an amazing beach PERFECT for a family. Because of the Nature Preserve the area is loaded with fish. Just walk out 5 feet from shore and you are surrounded by beautiful fish. Our butler set up or chairs, towels, snorkle gear, and bread to feed the fish each day. My kids are young but we had a great time: Aqua Ball, snorkling, kayak, wave runners, swimming pool, water slides, power water guns in pool, tons of kids activities and games. If it had rained the indoor Adventure Zone is awesome with tons of stuff to keep the kids busy. The indoor Arcade is also great, clean, neat, updated and well organized! There are also plenty of computers for the kids to use if they wish. We ate dinner at all of the restaurants and every meal was divine! The babysitting service was top notch as well. There was never a moment we were bored or stuck for an idea of what to do. I might also mention when my son became ill (the last day!) and we mentioned it in passing to the staff they immediately sent a nurse to check him (she didnt not charge us) as well as sending room service with gatorade, ice, water, rice and crackers. The staff constantly checked on him (and I) throughout the day to see if they could help in anyway. Their genuine kindness was amazing and appreciated!

"The Shangri-La was wonderful. We stayed in one of the Ocean Club rooms. It was a bit more expensive but so worth it. We took full advantage of the Ocean Club. The breakfast was great as was the evening happy hour. They also provided snacks, including sandwiches all day. And the view! It was amazing. Our room was on the top floor overlooking the water. The balcony was very spacious and comfortable so we spent quite a bit of time out there. The staff could not have been more friendly and welcoming. They provided just the right amount of attention, not to overbearing. There are 4 restaurants on the property. We went to one and the food and service were outstanding. The beach is a good size with plenty of chairs. The snorkling was stunning. We would definitely return to this resort.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The Shang-ri La brand excels on providing the best hotel service in the world and the Mactan Resort & Spa represents that statement very well. From the check in to the check out, everything was perfect! We are greeted without hesitation at the door, our bags are tagged and grouped for delivery to our room. We are given fresh juice at the Front Desk and are greeted with a smile and a hello by every employee that we pass by.

Rooms are very nice, clean, and very well maintained considering the hotel isn't that new. The bathrooms are big (our tub looked slightly old and dirty, even though it wasn't) and there are speakers in the bathroom, so that you can hear the TV or set up mood music.

There is so much to do in the resort besides the typical swimming, waterslides, and sunbathing. The resort is on the beach, with the ocean there for swimming (it was a bit rocky for walking in) and lots of beach chairs. The service was a bit slow on the beach because there were no flags or ways to notify the servers that you needed them. There were always enough beach and pool chairs available even though the resort was busy. It never felt over crowded. There is also a 6- hole pitch and putt golf course (if you don't mind sharing, I recommend paying for 1 set of clubs and sharing to save money), water basketball, volleyball, giant chess, a Time Zone, badminton, computer room, X-Box to play with, Adventure Zone (place to drop off your kids with a ball room, arts and crafts, etc), 3 or 4 restaurants and much more. I would recommend this place for families or couples.

The spa is supposedly world reknown, but the prices were beyond even US prices, so I didn't have a chance to try it.

It was so relaxing and I will definitely return to this place!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"This resort has perhaps one of its greatest gems - it's very own private marine reef sanctuary in it's backyard. The corals and marine life can be viewed with snorkeling gear just off it's beach. Waters are clear and very calm. This was a friends and family outing consisting of 4 adults and 3 kids (Ages: 5, 8 and 8). Hotel is located conveniently 15 mins from the airport and has a full range of family and kid friendly activities and facilities. Apart from the snorkeling which we got to see Nemo's and Sgt Major fishes that would swim right up to you, a huge pool and newly opened slides keeps the kids all fired up. There's also a miniature golf course, activity center (table tennis, punch bags for slightly older kids) and in particular - the kid's adventure center. This is a 2-storey high indoor play area with slides and all (remember to bring socks and wear long sleeves). Extremely safe with the staff present. Hospitality was good as always at a Shang establishment. We stayed at the Ocean Wing which was newer and closer to the beach. It's got it's own separate check-in lobby and breakfast restaurant. Mind you, this is a huge compound unlike other resorts. The mature coconut trees, flora and nice landscaping coupled with outdoor sofas and deck chairs make this truly a resort. One other great thing - kids below 12 eat free for both lunch and dinner. And if you feel you need some retail therapy - Cebu City has a few large malls to cater to that: SM / Ayala / Park Mall...",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"I had visited this hotel twice, first Stember 2010, second November 2011. As you know this hotel is the highest pricing hotel, of course I cosider that when I reviewed.

First visit,
1) I and my family (hus and son) were impressed, their facility, meal and service.
2) Room was just good but not superbe considering the price. I made a reservation for Oceanwing, but when checked in, the room was not ready, front desk suggest main wing ocean view room (they said it's upgrade) We were tired and did not want waste time for additional waiting, accepted. But when we entered into the room (no escorting service), we jumped out immediately, due to strong and terrible smelling. It was a kind of stink of rotten laundry, we could not stay the room for a minute. I contacted the front desk to change the room (actually to the room originally I reserved) , but long waiting and my own visiting front desk again was required before final room assigned. No apology for this. Second room was also little smelling (on 2nd floor), but could be negligible considering our shot stay. Except that most of things were good, food, service and facility, especially we felt it was better because we had stayed 'Imperial Palace Hotel' the day before which we felt terrible.

Second Visit.
1) We had arrived very late (2 AM), and we were assigned 1st floor room. I do not like ground floor, because usually in tropical weather it could be smelling. But it was too late and front desk said it was bigger room for the family, I accepted and we were escorted. Not avoiding my worry, the room smelled of mold. Of course they said there's no room available for change, we should accept. It was terrible, due to not only for smell but also (more serious) humidity. All bedding was almost wet, thus in the bed we felt sleeping with wet clothes, the airconditioner was not helpfule at all.
Of course next morning I had requested room change, and I could get 3rd floor room (normal size), much much better, not smelling and not wet (as like normal 5 star hotel room). Really the room of first night was not above 3 star level. I can hardly believe those two rooms are in same hotel. (Avoid ground level room)
2) Food was same with first visit, but service was not on same level. Especially on sunday (first day) there were a lot of day visitors, thus hard to get enough service from pool side bar (Aqua and Buko??). They missed order or delayed a lot or delivered wrong food, and some time ignored the call. It was not the service level we expected in Shanglila. (If possible avoide stay in SAT or SUN)
3) Their late check-out time became 4 PM (on the first visit it was 6 PM), I paid full one night charge for 8 PM check out. But it's OK. Check-out on Ocean wing was rapid and efficient.

Comparing with other resort in Cebu, and those in other popular destination in South-east Asia, as like Phuket, Bali and etc, this hotel is not bad, but cosider the price, I am not sure it's great. Maybe for a while I and my family would not return this hotel for the vacation. Not so impressive or fascinating.",Value for money:Staff:Food
"We stayed here 2X this year and both stays were excellent. Staff deserves a 5/5 as everyone of the 600 full+part timers work as if this is the only resort to work for. EVERYONE from the car rental driver to the cleaning staff to the pool and beach staff and in room dining staff were excellent. First time we travelled just my husband and I and I was 6 months pregnant. Every staff member in the beach area made sure I was comfy as the pool beds didn't have pillows so they had to run and get them. It was high season so I wasn't expecting any special attention. They also check you are alright with beverages, towels, etc not hard selling or anything. The food was amazing both times. Beach barbeque, aqua and breakfast buffet all good.
The second time we arrived with our 3 month old baby. The resort is very family friendly so if you have issues with kids, maybe this isn't the place for you. Having said that, there are areas like the pool in front of Aqua w/c are almost adults only - unless you fancy your child breathing second hand smoke from lounging swimmers.
As per activities, my husband did snorkeling and loved it. We also went to the CHI spa which was absolutely amazing. No kids here so great perk to use their private pool if you want a little quiet time.
The rooms are being upgraded in phases I hear. Ours was fine both times in the Ocean wing. Very good value so if there is a bit of tile that is not in place that's part of the great value. If you're obsessed with condensation like a prior reviewer, maybe just ask for another room bec there are a ton.

The management is very responsive to ideas for improvement. I filled out the comment card for both stays and got an email twice acknowledging all the comments, and there were a lot. Little things that I noticed especially as a new mom. I don't get this much service both during and after a stay from other hotels in this price range so whoever thinks there's no manager should just fill in the comment form on the way out. There is also a food and beverage manager who is always in the lookout during the breakfast buffets and lunches and dinners to check everything is ok.

Overall a great resort, 5/5 when rooms are upgraded. The only shade of spotty service was the check in/check out w/c took a bit of time but is understandable in peak season.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
The hotel was very expensive for the facilities that they have on offer. The bedrooms are very tired and in need of refurbishment. That said the food and service were good.

"Stayed for the weekend and enjoyed it. Hotel is nice, but a little older - stayed in the Ocean wing. Sits right on the beach, and has a great views. Had lunch on the beach, and it was excellent. Visited the Chi spa - amazing! Dove 2 dives with Scotty's right there at the resort. It was a good choice and easy to do. Had dinner in one of the restaurants, which was fine. They wanted to charge $800 PHP to uncork a bottle of wine, which seemed high, especially since they have a wine shop on prem.
Upon check out, they had this mysterious charge on the bill greater than the amount of a 1 day's stay. She said is was the ""room guarantee charge"". I didn't argue with her, but will be researching it when I'm home. Seemed excessive and unnecessary since we showed up.

"Shangri La Hotel in Mactan Cebu is on a sprawling estate. So much to do to keep all the kids occupied. The property is so big, there is a pitch and putt course. It is very spacious that you can find your own private gazebo or hammock or bench or swing, at different areas, isolated from the others. The kids on the other hand can spend hours at the big multi level pools. They have a good water slide, and are building a water park Aquazone. Kids can also do the Adventure Zone (ball Pool, big slides, obstacle course) or Mini Golf, or the beach.
Beach is okay in size with white sand. Surprisingly have good snorkeling with lots of small and big fishes. Nice touch of cocoon style cover for sunbathing cots- for hot days.

Always lots to do , but always at a relaxed pace and ambiance. Take note however that most activities are free, but some do come at a fee. Freebies are billiards, boxing arena, outdoor badminton, volleyball, ping pong, pool slides and activities, computer usage, etc. Activities with fees are banana boats, pitch and putt course, mini golf, wind surfing, etc. Anyway, check before you use the facility if it is free. If you are a Scuba diver, the dive fee is expensive. Scuba World is a dive facility you can walk to from the hotel (5 minute walk- turn right upon exiting the hotel main drive way), for less then half the price. Its a pleasant walk too.

Cebuano hospitality will always surprise you. Pleasant people- so goes without saying the staff will always be friendly.

The breakfast buffet does not disappoint. Lots to choose from. There's so much to try, that we end up in the dining area till about 10:30 am and could not eat anything till about 4 pm, for snacks. During peak seasons, I recommend starting early at 7 am or come later at about 9:30 to avoid the rush.

Would definitely recommend it. Enjoy!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"The overall impression of the resort is very impressive. They've got their swimming facilities and man-made beach well organized and designed. A good variety of food selection for the morning buffet was good, especially the generous offers of tropical fruits. I am a mango person and there is more than enough to go around. The Chinese restaurant there is also a ""must"" try. I was impressed by the quality. Thanks to the Head chef from Malaysia. '

There is only a small complaint that Shangri-la might need attention. The room we had on the older wing 6th floor was quite outdated and had a strong mildew smell when we opened the door. We asked for a room change and got another on the 9th floor, which still have the similar smell but less. I think operation must look into the matter and try to have those rooms update.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"We stayed at this resort for one night as a surprise visit for our friends who were getting married there.

We arrived very early Saturday morning at Cebu airport but they still had Shangri-La staff at the airport to take us to the resort. Check in staff were still friendly at that time in the morning and whilst we were told previously that we could not check in until 8am we were able to. Even better we were able to use the room then at no extra charge so we were able to catch up on some sleep, so thank you Shangri- La.

We booked a sea view room, which we were able to see the sea but maybe more of the resort to be honest. The room is fairly large, with a double bed, couch and dressing table and usual standard amenities. There was a balcony too. The bathroom had a tub and shower together and single sink, again with the usual selection of amenities and towels.

There was an older style CRT television but at least it worked. We were in the main wing but having visited our friends who were staying in the ocean wing, it was apparent that our room was older and could probably do with modernising.

Breakfast was included in our tariff and it was an international buffet type with a large and varied choice. The restaurant was very busy but staff still were courteous. They had a live noodle cooking station which was ok, but I've had better in hotels I've stayed at in southeast Asia.

We used their pool and beach, which are only some of their facilities. The sea was clear and full of marine life so snorkelling was great fun. We attended a wedding at their chapel but still there's loads more you could to do, which we didn't have time for. It's a very family orientated place so bear that in mind if you're just wanting a romantic getaway.

Overall this is a nice hotel with a lot you can do and friendly staff.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"Aside from the lovely grounds and amenities, what stood out are the welcoming and helpful staff that made our stay a wonderful, relaxing getaway. The kids enjoyed the beach where they saw lots of fish & swimming at the pools. The resort provides swimming rings & snorkeling gear so there was no need to bring our own. I did some snorkeling with a helpful hotel guide who showed some specimens under water including giant clams, lots of bat fish & other colorful tropical fish. The resort is doing a great job doing their share in adopting a marine sanctuary. They also offer a lot of other free activities like kayaking, art activities for kids, etc.

There are lots of places and nooks to just chill out at this resort. I haven't tried the Chi Spa though. Maybe next time. The breakfast buffet was more than adequate with lots of Asian and Western choices. All wait staff who attended to us were more than helpful, even bringing out fresh marshmallows from the kitchen when my son eyed the ones on the jar display.

Here are the only cons during our stay. We kept waking up at night due to noisy guests returning to their rooms. We could hear their loud voices and knocks to their doors. Apparently, they didn't know how to use doorbells. We never had issues of noisy, screaming kids. The only other complaint comes from our kid. He said there were annoying, noisy Korean grown ups in the kiddie pool trying to deflate the swimming rings. They were eventually approached by the lifeguard.

Overall, we really loved our stay.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We didn t know what to expect while arriving in this hotel except the reputation from the Shangri La itself. But after 5 days we can just say it was close to perfection : Cebu is a good place, Shangri la is a great one : the place is just amazing : fantastic beach with exotic fishes in no distance (just put a mask and you ll be like in any aquarium), the pools are just great for all ages and the service is just perfect : ever smiling people who realy take care, remember your name or like and dislike.
The room are good, and the formula Ocean's club is just perfect when you have kids : private breakfast, lunch and quick diner, a place to rest when the children are sleeping in the room, with always drinks and things to eat...
We have not much seen from the philippines this time, but will certainly come back and certainly in Shangri la. congrtulation to all their team !!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"It's a luxurious hotel with huge territory and tropical garden. Comparing to some other hotels of this brand it looks a bit dated, but remember it's one of the oldest 5-star Philippine hotel.

Pros:
- excellent location just 10 minutes drive from Cebu international airport;
- nice territory, 2 large pools, infinity pool is the highlight (as well as Ocean Wing ocean-facing rooms view I guess);
- personnel is sufficiently trained, high level of service;
- magnificent beach bar, spending here late evening watching dark dark Visayan sea and drinking a cocktail is terrific experience;
- quiet enough hotel (though huge), convenient for both families and couples;
- security is guaranteed, very important item due to Mactan island neighborhood is not looking safe at all.

Cons:
- only one complain to be mentioned, we sensed the smell of mustiness and dampness when first entered our room. But the problem was solved by housekeeping staff very quickly.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed here to celebrate my family reunion. It was such an experience! The staff were so attentive. The buffet breakfast was scrumptious. The kids and even I as an adult really enjoyed all the water sports (zorb, kayaking, snorkeling). The snorkeling and feeding of the fish were the best part of the trip! A must try is the Buko Shake at their Buko Bar! This trip was perfect! Given another vacation, I would want to go back here!",Food:Location
