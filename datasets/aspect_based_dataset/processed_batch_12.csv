"Stayed at the Edsa Shang for business, I was in the garden room wing. Overall the hotel is well done with a respectable staff (attentive however not hovering) and plenty of amenities. Though I didn't use the pool area, I noticed it was done well to shut out all of the surrounding traffic noise and had a nice area for kids. The gym was expansive with plenty equipment and connected to good steam/sauna rooms. Plenty of meal options at the multiple restaurants, a few coworkers never left the premise to eat and were very happy. Also, quick walk to MegaMall or the upscale Shangri-La mall, many options for shopping and eateries. Only downside was the room was out dated, well maintained but could use a remodel.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"There are now three Shangrilas in Metro Manila. One in Makati, another in BGC (Makati/Taguig Area) and the Edsa Shangrila in Pasig. For a family outing, this hotel is still pretty good for its price. We always get a connecting room which makes it more enjoyable for the kids. The best place is still the garden wing but staying in the tower wing this time was a very enjoyable experience.
The front desk was especially helpful and the concierge and its stay were very attentive.
The pool area was very enjoyable for the kids and I especially felt relaxed as the life gaurds (there were three I could see) were very attentive especially to the kids. There were a few times they had to blow their whistles but it was not obtrusive.
Heat's breakfast set-up was still up to par offering a variety of food. At night, the Summer Palace still served excellent Chinese food and was a bit surprised they still had open tables when we ate there last Saturday.
The grill at the poolside was good but their potato and fries buffet could be better improved. The staff were generally attentive and acceptable but not excellent.
The Japanese restaurant is still there but did not try it this time. So with Paparazzi but had a bad experience there before (never coming back) but surprisingly it was till open, I assumed the extremely back service and back food was more a fluke from before.
Overall it was a great experience and value for your money.",Food:Staff
"Edsa Shangri-La Manila never ceases to out perform itself in terms of facilities. The hotel still looks good despite being 25 years old. It's food and beverage outlets still among the best in the metropolis. My favourite, East Cafe.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"What can I say - in-room check in for my convenience (what a treat!), the wonderful staff, the gym, the food, the surroundings. Two things that do not subtract from the score: 1. Please don't wait 15 min when brining my morning coffee and 2. Please don't apologize when I lock myself out of my room and you come running within 5 min. It was my own fault!!
Keep it up!",Staff:Food
"You just don't sleep here. there's a lot of things you can do. They have fast internet, and a lot of facilities like fitness center, dry and steam saunas, jacuzzi's, cold plunge bath and outdoor swimming pool, tennis court.

The swimming pool is inside the forest and they call it garden which is cool. I call it forest coz there's a lot of trees rather than a lot of flowering plants. hehe

The staff is accommodating and polite.

You will enjoy your stay here.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"This is just a review of the banquet hall because we celebrated a friend's 80th birthday here, but did not stay overnight. The place is just what a five star Shangri-La hotel should be. (I like the one in Makati better, though.) It is a big place, but finding your way to the banquet hall is worth the misguided adventure.

The hall was beautiful but slightly functional (i.e. stoic, bland, or generic). The food was good, but it is expensive for what you get. You don't go there just for the food though. The atmosphere is something that just can't be described. To give you an idea, the banquet room had four chandeliers the size of a small house. It is worth doing every chance you can afford to go.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
If you have booked before at the Shangri-La in Makiti prepare to be disappointed. When entering the hotel it appears very similiar but this is where the comparisons end. The rooms appear to be significantly smaller and the amenities are just not the same. Getting a gluten free meal after midnight - a real struggle. Each restaurant has a gluten free symbol at the bottom of the menu but no meals tagged???? No bar to speak of other than the lobby and just not the same feel. Makiti for me next time.,Food:Comfort & Facilities

"I stayed here about a year ago, and rated it 5 stars at the time. This visit, I see no reason not to rate EDSA Shang again 5 stars. From the Mercedes 550SL that picked me up at the airport, to the check in process where hotel staff met me curbside from the SL550 and walked me directly to my hotel room, to the again fabulous lobby and entertainment, the clean and well appointed room, the excellent attitude extolled from all staff who bend backwards to be nice, this is one great hotel. The health facility renovation has been completed, and it is a first class. Fun classes for all types, gorgeous locker rooms and showers, clean machines, and staff the make you feel like royalty.

I did not partake in the buffet breakfast in Heat this time around, and opted for coffee and pastries from the hotel lobby shop. The staff there are really pleasant, pastry selection good, and coffee decent.

Not a complaint, however, what happened to the reception ladies attire? They used to be so elegantly dressed. Now it is a drab business style.

Some gripes:
1] The wifi is terrible. My research into this found that only two hotels in MetroManila have reliable wifi, and both those hotels are in Makati. Thankfully, the wired room connection is pretty darn good, and was able to do my work and actively participate in online mtngs.
2] My visit coincided with Valentine’s Day. The hotel had a large event that took over the lobby area. I wasn’t able to use the lobby area that night. There were no alternatives other than my room. I wish the hotel had given notice to the guests that their lobby area was reserved for an event. Unsure why the event wasn’t located in a ballroom.
3] Like last time, it is nearly impossible to get a taxi at the front entrance. I’m told by the locals this is deliberate, to perhaps have you use the hotel’s rental car service which can cost quite a bit. You must walk to the rear entrance where taxis are relatively easy to flag down. I wish the front door staff would simply suggest to try the rear entrance.

Still, EDSA Shang deserves to be rated Excellent. This is a fabulous hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"this was my first ever visit to Manila and after the traffic which is quite astonishingly slow to arrive at the Shangri la is to arrive at an oasis! The staff are some of the most friendly and helpful I have ever known, (but the Philippines is packed with friendly people so I suppose that was to be expected..) it was great anyway!!
Our room in the garden wing was at the early stages of 'tired' but not in any way tatty or scruffy, everything worked and the bed was comfortable.
The range of choice at breakfast was quite astonishing! I have never had so much choice and seen so many quality things offered. it is without question the widest choice I have ever seen!
We had a great time and will be back soon in Manila. it is certain we will stay in a Shangri-la but probably the new one in Fort Bonifacio which we understand will be even better",Staff:Food:Location

We had an Early check in and late check out at no extra cost as well, made me realize that your hotel is not all about the money but making sure that we feel that money we spent are all worth the experiences we had.

"Usually stayed in Makati Shang but tried Edsa Shang this time. The room n toilet are smaller but it's cheaper too. Very comfortable as u can always expect from Shangri-la. Facilities are complete. Gym is big and not many people. There was a free yoga class last night too.

The hotel is right next to the Shangri-la mall where u can find food and things from the very expensive boutiques til the more affordable ones.

Good choice to stay. Recommended.

Only one problem which is the same as Mactan Shang in cebu too. You have to shower in the bathtub. Though curtain is closed water still flows out and wet the floor. Maybe there are some Shang-shower skills which I haven't acquired.

"We have just returned from a wonderful 10 days at the EDSA Shangri-La. Our visit coincided with Lunar New Year and Valentine's Day and despite the hotel being completely booked, service was top notch throughout the hotel.

With the traffic as it is in Manila it is a bonus that the hotel is located adjacent to several large malls catering to whatever your imagination could wish. There are also several restaurants in the hotel, and in the immediate surrounding area that shouldn't be missed.

The pool area is large and offers various options for sun worshipping or enjoying the shade of the numerous palm trees surrounding it. It should be noted that weekends draw many local families, not to mention many of the city's large expatriate community, to the hotel to use the pool, eat at the restaurants and just enjoy some downtime. It is best to get a chair early as the sun leaves the pool at around 2pm.

Our room was satisfactory, with nice bedding, towels and robes. The bathroom had a large walk-in shower with a rain-shower head in addition to the hand-held shower. It did not have a bathtub.

As in any older hotel, there are always projects to be done and worked on. The elevators have been recently redone and are fast and efficient. The carpets are beginning to show wear and will need to be replaced in the upcoming years.

We will be returning here in April.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"We stayed at the hotel for the holiday so the kids can swim and try the water slide. It was a usual stay like any of our stays other in other hotels. Service is excellent. Room is clean. Staff is courteous in all parts of the hotel.

But I think what sets good service from excellent service is when the staff experiences something out of the ordrinary and still rises above it. My son was swimming by the slide doing his thing when suddenly hives and rashes appear all over his body. My son is not the allergic type and its the first time this has happened. Immediately, the pool staff alerted the clinic and within 2 minutes a doctor, nurses, security, the duty manager were there to assist us. More than 10 people to give their helping hand which I and my son appreciate. The doctor assessed my son and gave him oxygen right away and gave the proper first aid. I would like to that Dra. Sunico, the nurses of the clinic, Ms. Corpuz, the Duty Manager who showed sincere concern to my 11 year old son.

"I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in asia, I was expecting more but on average the room was comfortable and the service at the restaurant was fantastic. Things to improve on... wi-fi was virtually non-existent.. I was here on business and on many nights I was not able to connect to the wi-fi..the status is always weak or my phone or laptop were not able to detect the wi-fi at all... the toilet always smell of cooking after 10 pm for some reason, I have to make sure I shut the toilet door tight so the smell doesn't leak to the room...another disappointment for a 5 star hotel....

Breakfast was another shocker... there was a long queue at the breakfast table, this is not because there is no table available but the staff took their time to clear the queue.... I was the 6th in queue but it took 15 minutes before I was shown to my table...

I was a frequent stayer in another hotel chain and I thought I will give Shangri-la a try but unfortunately it doesn't live up to my expectation",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Internet
Hotel room is nice but now lacks a bath tub. It does have a seat bench in the shower room. The health club is newly refurbished with a modern look although I prefer the original oriental design.

"I was looking forward to my stay at the Shang...The location is next to two malls that are within a few minutes from the hotel on foot. The staff was kind and very willing to assist. However, there are some operational issues that need to be addressed because from beginning to end there were things that guests would think twice of returning to the hotel if they had a choice. The first one was a minor inconvenience when the newly issued hotel card keys would not work on the elevators to get to my room. The long line at the HEAT for breakfast with wait time close to an hour makes you feel like standing in line at a Las Vegas buffet line. Lastly, guest check out times during peak hours must be made quicker.

"Three in 1 - functionality, service and understated elegance.

This is a hotel we frequent for many years, perhaps in the past 10 yrs. We frequently hold events and functions here, and also use this for personal stay or for our overseas guests. Shangrila will not let you down. Hold your business functions or social events here, you get the most out of it since they have built their experience over the years. The same senior staff has been here since at least 10 yrs ago.

Hotel rooms are big and have been refurbished and continuously been improved over the years. We recently stayed in one of the suite rooms with an ante room.wuth a sofa and 48in flat screen TV, writing desk and welcome basket of fruits. The bedroom is attached to a large marbled bathroom with jacuzzi and steam facilities. Toilettries are superb using L'Occitane. Towels are crisp and white. It's very clean and fresh. Needless to say bed is comfortable and the bedroom has a great view of the pool and gardens. Though this is a suite room, rest assured other regular superior or de luxe rooms are equally comfortable and homey.

Breakfast buffet is excellent with the greatest selection from usual continental to filipino, Chinese, Japanese, Indian, European. From healthy yogurts and fruits to heavy rice and tapa or curry and roti and delightful crepes and pastries and many many more. you can feast on every morning. You can choose to sit AL fresco or dine in.

Pool area is lovely and you can simply relax on the poolside or enjoy a dip with a beautiful lush within the city scrapers. The pool bar serves good quality food you can enjoy all day.

Chill in the lounge bar with friends or simply relax and enjoy the music in various times of the day.

This is definitely the best place to stay in the heart of Manila, very central and accessible with the MRT just across within shangrila mall and voila you can shop and hop to other places like Makati and Quezon City from there very easily.

Come and enjoy the beautiful smiles and beauty of Filipino hospitality in Edsa Shangri-la.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

Staff is always aware and active to all our needs.

I've been a Golden Circle Member for a long time and they never miss a birthday! The last time I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La they surprised me with a chocolate mousse cake which was thoughtful. They always go the extra mile. The turn around time for their replies when you try to contact them through email for any inquiries is quite fast.

My favorite part of this hotel is their health club, and you don't even have to be a health buff to love everything about it. The facilities are great - they have trainers ready to assist you at any time, and you can even have your BMI checked. They also have a jacuzzi, sauna & steam room.

Watch out for their promos - last December they had room rates inclusive of 'Disney on Ice' tickets which were practically free. They also have promotional offers for non-staying guests at their Heat restaurant which can either be a lunch or dinner buffet.

The newly renovated lobby lounge is also a relaxing place to hang out after a long day. You can opt to go to 'The Bakeshop' located near the main entrance - their pastries go on sale at 50% off after 8pm and the cronut is to die for.

"I was able to reserve for a traditional Hilot massage. By stroke of luck, there was traffic so got there almost photo finish. Chi, The Spa is near the pool area, they got a separate lift for it from the hotel. The address in the web states level 4, 5 Garden Wing. I thought it was just Garden Wing of the hotel. It is like the one in Shangri-la Kota Kinabalu area where it has separate hut. Prior to the massage, while they let you fill out the questionnaire prior to the massage, they serve the ginger tea.

It would be best to go there an hour earlier than the scheduled time when you are in Manila and will be coming from another place. There is a steam bath with shower. This is best enjoyed before the relaxing massage. The bathroom have a small pitcher of water with lemon slices and a fruit cup. They also provide disposable underwear and robe.

The hilot massage comes with warm banana leaf to heat the body before the relaxing massage. They make sure that they wash their hands prior to the massage. They also wash again before massaging your head and face area. I think because I was late, they need to prep the place again for another client. They had to open the curtain and tidy up the place while I was in the bathroom.

The gauge of a good massage is the day after, I felt good, the soft relaxing massage was different from the Shiatsu type wherein there would be bruise the next day and pain still felt in some parts.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

Pool was really clean, great staff always made you welcome there assisting with anything you would need. Really recommend this hotel not only because of all the above things, but also for being so safe: each taxi entering hotel has their boot/trunk checked by the guards with dogs.",Staff:Food
"I had a memorable experience at Rdsa Sangrila executive floor and had a very warm and good experience personally with every staff at the club lounge including their great and charming chefs.

"I had my tinghun Summer palace. I have to commend Ms. Nancy for being hands on in attending to our event. They have a wonderful Chinese operations director! However, the food was underwhelming, considering we paid 21-25 thousand per table. The steamed shrimp with garlic sauce and the lapu-lapu dish not only were overcooked (hard and chewy), but were also served cold. The misua for the tinghun ceremony was served cold as well, especially the bottom portion. The suckling pig cold cuts and pecking duck were both really good. For the soup and scallops, I must say that we’ve had better for a far lesser price. I and my fiancé were initially considering Edsa Shangri-la for our wedding reception; however we came to the conclusion that how the food was prepared during our tinghun will reflect how it will be on any occasion. All in all, the authenticity was absent. The dishes were not served Lauriat style.

For the overnight stay , it was unusual to find a shoe print on one of the bed sheets under the comforter. Since we were really tired because of the intense traffic going there, we did not bother to call the attention of the management and wait for soiled sheets to be replaced.

Overall, the ambience was really nice. The bellhops were also commendable. Even if some of the tinghun ceremony stuff were heavy, they gladly took them to our room and from the event to our car. Upon check out, my fiance and I gave them P1,000 tip for sharing because we were so happy with their hospitality and service!",Food:Staff
Staff at registration knew exactly what my requests were when I arrived at 3:00 am for a late check-in. Was pleasantly surprised that the hotel was updated. Room was great and so was the lobby! Looking forward to coming back.,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Have heard that a renovation for the hotel is scheduled for 2016. That's a good thing; the rooms need it; they're tired. The staff members continue to be accommodating which is a plus for us since, oftentimes, we have plenty of work to do in the room before going to city meetings. The lobby lounge service is erratic. Room service food comes from HEAT, the lobby restaurant, and is too frequently cold when it arrives. The Italian and Chinese restaurants have offered pleasant experiences. There's a lot of completion in Manila now but we're hopeful this property can be brought up to speed.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"The Edsa hotel was our last stop on our vacation in the Philippines. We had been staying at budget hostels and decided to treat ourselves and it was well worth it. The room was excellent - with the most comfortable beds I have ever slept on. But more so, the staff were amazing. After a mishap with Uber, my friend and I were dangerously close to missing our flight. The hotel staff helped us to call motorbike taxis and waited with us until they arrived. Excellent customer service, and an excellent hotel.",Staff
"The hotel was of course beautiful, and the rooms amazing. There was a pillow menu, in case you weren't satisfied with the one they provided. And sleeping in the hotel bed was the best sleep I had in months. It was an added bonus when we showed up and found that the hotel has a Plaza attached to it, where there are many clothing stores, a big food court, wine, super market, coffee shops. In addition, just down the street there is the SM Mega Mall, which had a really good selection of well known brands too. It was nice not to have to go very far to get everything we needed. The staff at the lobby were really attentive, and helpful. The pool was also amazing.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"They are insisting on valet parking while there are still spaces. The room is small compared to other hotels with that ranking. On breakfast, they usher you to other rooms but the choices of food is limited, to our dismay.
No sufficient chairs on their lobby, so while waiting for our companions to check in we have to stand for that long period of time.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"This is the second time we stayed in this hotel and nothing has changed, still a pleasant experienced. The food are great and the staff are very polite.

It is also very near to shopping malls which make it a plus if you want to go for quick shopping or try different restaurants.

The pools are good and my kids enjoyed the slide.",Food:Staff:Location
"I have stayed in Edsa Shang numerous times. It is my go to hotel whenever I celebrate my wedding anniversary (had my reception here way back in 2000).

When I checked my FB posts, I have stayed here in the past 4 years every December 28. This 2015 was no different.

The hotel is still beautiful & elegant despite its age. The room we stayed in was a Delux but still very luxurious. Bed was a King Size which was good and the pillows were very soft. Tv is your standard flatscreen with USB port for your movies.

Bathroom was also very spacious but expect no bidet on the toilet and a shower instead of a bath tub.

Breakfast at Heat is still good but their lunch/dinner buffet is better.

The Hotel is connected to the mall so you can shop leisurely and not worry about parking.

Overall, I still like the place as it is comfortable and gives a very relaxing vibe. I have stayed here and will most likely continue to stay here. It is indeed a home away from home.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Ok so where should I start? My husband and I decided to stay in edsa shang rila for 1 night from our international flight before flying domestic. When we get there, I noticed that most of the staff are very accommodating to my foreign husband without paying any attention to me. They greeted my husband, offered help and everything but not to me - the service towards me is very cold - I felt invisible. I honestly felt discriminated from my own country. Not what I expect from a well known 5 star hotel. The staff needs to be trained to give an excellent service to their customers regardless of their nationality. By the way I am 24 y/o and my husband is 26y/o, I don't see where the cold treatment is from.

Apart from that drama, the hotel itself is majestic! The pool is amazing.",Staff
"Stayed in this hotel as my family's new year celebration. Check in was smooth and general manager who attended us offered the horizon lounge in the garden wing for a discounted price.

Check in was a bit slow but organised compared to to how it was last year.
Staff were as always ever so fantastic and polite.
There were activities for the kids which my daughter attended and enjoyed.
Pool was crowded but understandable being a family friendly hotel, i would recommend adding more sun beds.

"Staying at Edsa Shangrila this holiday season makes a memorable Family get together experiencing their Winter Season having a snow falls outside the glass of the lobby is indeed a great scene. We checked in last December 24 and as expected it was a peak season and there are a lot of guests but booking our stay at the Horizon Club you get to experience the express check in and you don't have to worry falling in long lines at the Front Desk. Our Room for the 1st time was not in the pool view but it was ok. The staff there were all friendly and greeted us every-time they pass thru us. During our Dinner we went to the Paparazzi for an authentic Italian restaurant the food was superb and the interiors are very cozy. The staff there was great I would like to thank Ms. Jenny for the warm welcome and for assisting us and having a feeling of a 5 star service.
Staying at Edsa Shangrila and booking a Club Room with added privileges is having a worry-free vacation because you get to experience Daily Breakfast at the lounge. The food there is not extensive as the HEAT but everything you want for breakfast is served there. The service is more personalize because it is not crowded. I would like to thank Ms. Len also for being very friendly and cheerful in serving us during our breakfast. Thank you also for taking good care of my 2 boys when I left them there for breakfast. In Club Room you also have a privilege for an evening cocktails and canapes which is my husband favorite time and an afternoon tea with snack If I may suggest also If they can serve sandwiches during snacks prior to cakes and cookies.
During our stay my mom and I tried their Sauna/Steam Bath and the jacuzzi it was really pampering and relaxing. 3days and 2nights stay is really quite short to us because we are having a great time. So I will definitely go back again with my family next year. Thank you Edsa Shangrila for making our Holiday a memorable one.",Food:Staff
"I must say the hotel has improved, with much better service than before, and the people seem to know what they are doing now. They are better at accommodating requests and seem to have gone through training. The butler service is much better too ! However, the funny thing is for such a top hotel and I stayed at the edsa suite, the toilet paper is of similar quality to sandpaper...apart from that, its great !",Staff
"I was there for three nights. Their rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. Their staff is one of the best, starting from reception to lounge.

I was bit disappointed with quality of their food in HEAT restaurant, they are more focused on quantity and it adversely affects quality of food. For example- their Indian is the worst Indian food I have ever eaten in a 5 star hotel. It's not Indian at all, don't know who cooks this food.

I tried lounge and ordered a Lasagne. Food in lounge also comes from HEAT. By the time I got my lasagne it was cold and it tasted like ""Heat it and eat it"" type of food not specially prepared. Staff was excellent again, they replaced my food swiftly.

Overall, good place yo stay but I will eat elsewhere.",Food:Staff
"It's a good thing I requested early check in and late check out and after several email exchanges it was granted. I wished it didn't take too much effert as it did though because other hotels in Makati are very welcoming without the disclaimer of an extra charge for such requests. This request saved us from the block buster queue that was building in the lobby during the regular 2pm check-in time. It was good as well that we booked a room in the tower wing as the amenities were newer but the size is smaller and toiletries were not as nice as the other five star hotels I've been to. The pool was not yet crowded when we visited so it was good we took a dip before the chaos. The pool ambiance is very nice and is kid friendly. I love that there were lots of trees and plants giving it a redort feel. The Chi SPA was amazing well decorated & massues were well trained. We thoroughly enjoyed the health club as it had a very good line of equipment and wet room facilities. I commend them on that. Breakfast was excellent but because they were not ready for the check-in rush we had to wait a while before being seated. It was a good thing that they opened another ballroom toaccomidate their overflowing guests. Despite the crowded ambiance and over ccrowded pool my family still had a good time. Service and friendliness was a bit compromised but all in all it was a good stay. The 7pm snow show, the daily kiddie activity, the polar bear photo booths and the Christmas mass was a good touch helping make Christmas more festive in the Hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"My second time to stay at Horizon Club floor in this hotel. Disappointed this time that it took us 1.5 hours to finally get into our rooms. Rooms are well maintained but not as new. With the rate of the rooms in the club floor, it is a disappointment to see that the cocktail selections downgraded compare to my previous stay. Worst of all, cocktail hours is only from 5-7pm. I have stayed in many hotel lounges and this is the shortest operating hours I had experienced. Shangrila is one of my favorite hotel chain and i'm very surprised to get this kind of services.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I appreciate how attentive their staff are, from Mr. Albert of the lobby leading us to another check in counter at the back, to the generous housekeeping staff Mr. Roger who kept offering water and toiletries.

The room interior is a little bit outdated for my liking, but I guess because they gave a room from the older wing.

The breakfast buffet was nothing superb. They offered a number of cuisine but there was nothing really special about it.

As of writing, I'm currently enjoying my favorite salmon wrap in the lobby. I have a view of faux snow from my table which is delghtul.

It's around 4pm and we just left the room an hour ago. The lines for check-in are still overflowing, so this late check out is a kind gesture we truly appreciate.",Staff:Food
"I'm afraid this hotel has to come off the Number One spot in my favourite hotels list.

It's not that it is bad - heavens no - it is still a very good hotel but it's just not the same it was when we first stayed there many years ago and did my first Trip Adviser review singing its praises.

The staff are still ultra friendly and helpful but there were a few glitches during our latest pre-Christmas stay that simply would not have happened in the past.

It all started after we checked into our Horizon Club room at 12.30am after 15 hours travelling. We were met, as usual, by a pleasant lady who took us to our Horizon Club room (1234) - room delivery - a nice Shangri la touch. All we wanted was to get to sleep but despite phone calls and me wandering around searching for the bell boy, it took 45 minutes to have our baggage delivered which meant we had to stay awake until the suitcases arrived - that was a bad start and set us both off on the wrong foot.

We had booked a Horizon Club King Room and that's what we got - one has to remember that the rooms at the nearby Makati Shangri La are a lot bigger so don't expect anything very large - it's adequate but not roomy. If you have a lot of baggage, take my advice and book a larger room like we should have done and like we did on our previous stays - that room choice was my fault, not the hotels, I would add.

The room was fine, if showing a little age - the plumbing worked but needs an upgrade (eg the bath plug release sticks and the clothes drier line was totally useless - black/dirty and not working so we couldn't wash/dry our ""smalls""). Apart from that, the room was fine - A/C worked well, all typical Shang amenities were provided but we noted that the L'Occitane toiletries have been replaced with the Shangri la ""own brand"" stuff and pencils are provided for note taking rather than ball point pens.I'm sure there is an environmental motive here, rather than one of economy, so this is not really a complaint - just a comment.

Our bedroom Wireless Internet was free but bitty and intermittent - the signal was sometimes weak and caused downloads to drop both on hand held gear and laptops. I reported this and they did what they could to fix it without success so I assume that maybe it's just that the Wireless Internet in the hotel is ageing and just not up to scratch although we have never experienced that before when we have stayed here. I suspect, despite protestations to the contrary, that it might just have been a room location problem.

Their HEAT restaurant is still one of my favourites - that will not change - it's truly a Legend in the area - don't miss going there even if you are not staying in the hotel. We did have a little problem booking our table on the two nights we ate there but after some discussion, that was put right quite quickly. Ian, Marco and Lawrence must be singled out for exemplary service in HEAT and the Wagyu beef was gorgeous, even if we ate too much !

My wife bemoans the loss of their in house Beauty Salon but I suppose that is because there are now so many out of hotel locations for the ladies to maintain their appearance and such an establishment was not sustainable in the hotel itself.Who knows?

Don't get me wrong - this is still a fine hotel, especially in Horizon Club guise - it's just that it no longer makes us feel special like it used to and whilst our problems this visit were acted upon relatively promptly, in the old days such problems would not have happened in the first place. It's a pity.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

One surprise to me was to see the little water park for kids outside. There is a splash pad and a water slide. I saw very few families at the hotel, but if you happened to stay here with kids, they would be delighted to see this.
The restaurants are good, but are not cheap. $35 for breakfast, $50 or more for dinner.
There is live entertainment in the lobby during the evenings and the lobby was decorated really nice for Christmas while I was there.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

People are extremely polite and endearing, the food is delicious, the room is comfortable, there is an effort to engage in environmental responsibility with biodegradable packaging where possible, etc. The pool area is very nice. It isn't the most kid friendly hotel, but there is plenty to explore in the lobby and pool area with a child. It is certainly a very nice option for a work trip. It has a very close proximity to 2 enormous malls, if that's your thing and everyone is very keen to help make your stay comfortable.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

Great place !,Location
"Even if you survive the 2 and a half hour (non peak hour traffic ) pace slow transfer from the airport to the Shangri-La, Edsa, I'm afraid (and even as a loyal Golden Circle member ) I couldn't recommend this hotel.
We booked two rooms at the Horizon Level in the Garden wing. Despite everything being re confirmed in advance, check-in ( at about 3pm ) was slow, because the rooms were being checked. The rooms are tired and shabby. We had a view over the roof top car park of the shopping mall.
We went down to the lobby restaurant HEAT for a late lunch. We waited 45 minutes for a soup, laksa and rice dish, and when the latter arrived, it was stone cold. It had to be sent back.
The next morning ( Friday 9.10am ) we went for the buffet breakfast to the Horizon lounge. The breakfast area was a shambles, full of dirty uncleared tables. We had to sit down at a dirty uncleared table, we never given a menu, so we didn't know you could order eggs etc, at the buffet the food was cold, mostly empty dishes and I had to ask for glasses, dishes for the cereal and butter.
In the evening, we decided to have a drink and a snack in the lobby lounge - we waited 40 minutes for the snacks, which again were cold. I was offered a choice of only one white wine, and both the singer and the piano were badly out of tune.
I relayed all of the above to the duty manager.
Next day we went to the pool, which really has a lovely setting and is salt water. But the whole seating area was covered with dead leaves and dirt, including on the loungers ! Some staff did eventually arrive to clear up.
At breakfast the next morning, whilst it was a bit more organized ; I still had the same issues of having to ask for crockery and butter etc, even after having raised these issues with the duty manager the previous day.
We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant, the Summer Palace, on our last night - this was a saving grace, and was really excellent. Expensive, but well worth it.
In the evening, we ordered drinks to my friends room where we were chatting, but the staff kept delivering them to my room - despite being given the room number where we were. As in most hotels nowadays, I don't think the service center operators are able to recognize the room number on the system when one calls from the room. So it was a bit of a messy and spoilt evening.
We checked out early the next day.
I think unfortunately there are some systemic issues with the management and the team ; a lack of staff and poor training.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"This hotel is located in an ""upscale"" area and surrounded by lots of shopping. Laundry service is way too much so pack more than you need and wash it at home. I once did laundry here and was charged $200 (USD)! If you don't have breakfast included it will cost you $35 (USD). Don't bother asking for a free room upgrade even as a loyal customer because you won't get it. They definitely take advantage of the international traveler. The positive is that the people are super friendly, the pool is nice as well as the gym. If you find yourself up at night don't bother watching TV because the available channels suck! Don't wait to eat because everything closes by 10pm most nights.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"This was the annual convention of my profession this year and I was fortunate enough to br billetted here by my sponsor. I stayed 4 days 3 nights and I must say they've been able to keep their hotel up to par since the last time I stayed here almost 20 years ago.

As I've aged and gained more travel experience... I think I safelt say that there is nothing like a 5 star hotel with a 95% Filipino staff. The friendliness, hospitality and warmth has yet to be paralleled anywhere... but you have to remember, I am Filipino myself.

Breakfast at Heat is good and extensive as ever.

The area around the hotel has changed a lot. The parking lot which had to cross years ago to get to Shangrila plaza mall is gone and in its place is the wonderfully new east wing of Shangrila Plaza mall. Megamall is equally accessible by a few hundred steps. These are two excellent places to shop and eat at without having to deal with the HORRENDOUS December traffic.

The gym is very well eqiupped and updated. Though there is a sizeable crowd every morning there was always a handfull of cardio machines available for use.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"I have just checked out of the EDSA Shangri-La after a 2 week stay for work. I thought I would to stay there because the pool area looked very inviting. However I was prepared to be let down because things never look as soon as the pictures. Well this actually exceeded my expectations! That is one amazing paradise within an otherwise smoggy and chaotic city. It was a bit busy on the weekend mornings, but during the week it was practically deserted. Often I'd be the only one in the pool! (I was there late November-early December).
The buffet breakfast in the Heat restaurant is very good as well.
Most importantly, I was extremely impressed with the service I received everywhere in the hotel. I'm a former Customer Service Manager and I look for bad service. Didn't find it here! I had the most amazing room cleaning guy who made sure I was properly looked after at all times. The wait staff in the restaurant were great as well as where the folks working in the gym, by the pool, in fact everywhere.
It's hard to find something to complain about but if I have to say something negative, it would be that they blast this really strong old lady perfume smell in the lobby area where you come in. I really couldn't stand it, but I didn't spend much time there so it was okay.
I highly recommend this hotel. It can be quite pricey but it's worth it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Cleanliness

"Shangri-La Edsa was a disappointment. I only stayed there because I had such a good experience with the Shangri-La in Boracay. Obviously, all Shangri-La hotels are not on the same level and I would not choose this one in Manila again. I had only a short stay in Manila on my way back to New York and figured that this Edsa hotel was only a block from their largest mall to entertain me before my flight home. When I arrived in a private car, no one rushed to help me with my bags, people are not uniformed, and beyond the windows, it looked more like a mall itself, than a hotel. There are no automatic doors and only when I asked the front security guard if I'm at the Shangri-La hotel did they snap into attention and opened the door for me. The confusion continued as I had to look for the front desk which is not readily apparent. They gave me a smoking room, when I specifically requested for non-smoking due to my breathing sensitivities. The rooms are cramped, not luxurious, or eye-pleasing, and finding out they didn't put shampoo in the bathroom when you're in the middle of a shower was Not pretty. The staff does not seemed concerned for the quality of your stay. I actually had a far better experience at the Makati Holiday Inn attached to the Glorietta Mall, which is even closer to the airport. I looked down at my cousin's booking at first, but had a very pleasing stay at that Makati Holiday Inn; the rooms over there were modern and extremely clean, breakfast complimentary (not like Edsa Shangri-La) and the Glorietta Mall is much more organized, cleaner, and with better stores. Anyway, it's a NO for me regarding Shangri-La Edsa, considering I could get better value and better hotel experience elsewhere in the city!",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"It has all ammenities and things to use inside the room. Its expected because its super expensive per night. The buffet is good but they're very unfair for some. Some staff give out disposable containers for other customers to take out food from the buffet area while to others, they complain very harshly if they even take some bread out. Due to the rude and unclear policy of this hotel, it turned me off really well. Hope they teach their employees the same thing! Training is a must in 5 star hotels, right? Also, I was requesting for anti allergy beddings but all they gave me were pillows. For all sakes, this is a basic requirement since a lot of people have dust allergies.

"This is one of the best hotels in Manila. Good food. Great rooms. Excellent location. Shopping for great finds just around the corner. Malls are just 5 minutes walk from hotel. Only thing that needs to be checked is there is no waiting and sitting

My last visit in early Nov 15, they gave me a corner room and it came with a nice little balcony. Very nice.

"Stayed here for 3 nights and it is a great hotel! Have been to Manila a few times but this was my first time at the Edsa Shangri-la. Great service, great breakfast and overall atmosphere. Room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. If you like to exercise, then this is the place. Probably the best hotel gym I've been to!

Location wise it's next to 3 malls so if you like to shop, you won't be disappointed. However I found that there weren't so many good restaurants around....maybe I'm wrong because I'm not familiar with the area. Normally stayed in Makati and think that there are way more options there.

Would definitely stay here again!",Food:Location
"The quality of service improved a lot since i last went here.

Its very secure, clean, and spacious.

But more than this... the aircons are now super cold. Which means they got to fix them already.

"Our parents celebrated a major family milestone by having a little staycation getaway. I sent an email to the hotel management to make sure that the celebrants were treated to something special, and they went the extra mile.

Most hotels do the usual cake or perhaps a bottle of wine, or other treats within the hotel, but they came up with a very creative and personal experience beyond the walls of their hotel that really made the stay special.

As in my previous review, we love EDSA Shangri-La for its location and its relaxing resort feel in the middle of the city. The renovated rooms in the tower wing have beautiful flowered wall panels and the best hotel lighting we have experienced. (I have not stayed in the Garden Wing and cannot comment on the rooms there.) The food is good, and morning coffee is excellent.

But the ultimate luxury here is the service. The management and staff anticipated our needs, and most of all, took my little request and ran away with it.

Thank you, EDSA Shangri-La!",Food:Staff:Location

"This is the second time that we paid the security deposit in advance. What happened the first time was we paid double because the front desk insisted that we have not yet paid the security deposit. After finding out that we already did they said that it will be refunded. Recently, I booked and paid one day in advance because I dont want my guests to pay any amount of money for their stay. Surprisingly, the following day the front desk asked me to pay again for the security deposit. I told the front desk that I already did. He insisted that I have not paid it. I told him the second time that I already did. He argued with me and even showed me the computation of the base price, room rate and tax computation which was quite embarrassing and since other guests could hear us. I told the front desk guy that I am already tired and I want to take some rest because we just played golf but just to show give him proof that I already paid can go back to my car to get the receipt. Unfortunately, when I came back he was already gone. I approached the attending supervisor/manager and told him what happened. The supervisor/manager was able to verify that I already paid the security deposit. Basically, it was completely a waste of time doing the entire debate with the front desk. Uneccessary effort of going back to my car just to get the receipt. The supervisor/ manager was even asking his team why his staff did that when it was clearly stated in their system that I already paid the security deposit. I really don't know how what kind of customer service you can call that. I hope they can fix that.",Staff:Value for money

"I am not the type of person that check-in in a hotel within the metropolis just to unwind myself from week-long work. But given the chance, like long weekends Edsa Shangri-La is the place for me. For the past 15 years, my family stayed there for just 3 times. The service, ambiance was so good that we've come back 2 more times after the first. It is like a resort within the city. Great food specially from the Summer Palace (Chinese Restaurant) and if you want to escape from the high-priced hotel dining, Shangri-La Mall is just a bridge away which is connected to the hotel, and SM Mega Mall is just across the street. And don't forget the swimming pool which is enjoyed by people of all ages. And the Chi Spa, I was told was awesome.( Didn't have the chance to try it yet.)",Location:Food

"This is a long overdue review! I would just like to share my experience in Edsa Shang- throughout my stay Jasper Abuan in FO assisted me and made sure my birthday celebration goes well. The thing is, he was actually off duty for a few days at that time but he still managed to make my stay smooth. He even went to the hotel the same day he arrived from a trip with his wife just to personally assure me that Edsa Shang will take care of my needs. I even got a cake that says ""happy birthday!"" in my room. Small or big problem, he is one phone call away.

5 star also goes to Dhongsky and Manny from Bell. Kuya Dhongsky, I appreciated the fact that although I only needed his assistance once, he remembered that I mentioned to him that I am only back for a few days to celebrate my birthday. He then asked how my celebration went and wished me a safe flight back to HK.

And Kuya Manny, I asked him to buy me load because I needed to make an important call immediately and although he was unsuccessful, I still appreciated how he quickly offered me other options. Either you're part of the problem or the solution eh?

And Lawrence, from heat buffet - he was our attendant/waiter during the whole dinner. We were around 40pax but he still managed to take good care of us, he was very attentive. They serenaded me with a song as well before the night ended, wow.

Also, I think there's a back office in our reserved function room, I didn't like how other staff members just went back and forth inside like there were no guests there. None of them even smiled or greeted us.

One more little thing I did not like, a lady opened the door for me at the lobby entrance and I asked her if she could assist me with my luggage and she just pointed her finger and said ""ay duon po ma'am hindi sakin"". I was visibly in a hurry and on the phone yet she couldn't be bothered to help me. I think her name starts with J. Please take this as a constructive criticism. Everything else was great.

Thank you so much everyone at Edsa Shang. It was great.

Yours,

"As I have come to expect, this Shangri-La was extremely nice and the customer service was outstanding. I had a long weekend to spend in Manila to relax and this was a great hotel to do it at. The room I had on the 13th floor was very spacious and had an excellent view of the city and the pool. The breakfast buffet was outstanding, especially all the local fruits. The waitstaff at breakfast we all very friendly and helpful. I spent a lot of time at the pool and got to know the workers here very well. They made sure that i had everything that I needed and after a couple of days they were anticipating my needs. The pool setting was amazing with many palm trees, it made it feel like you were NOT in the middle of a large city. Next door to the hotel are 2 large shopping malls. Both of them have many restaurant choices at all price levels. This was a very enjoyable hotel to spend the weekend and relax.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"in a year i must say i stay in this hotel 3-4 times. food is delicious, ambiance is superb, service is at par to what it stands.
in our last 2 stays however we came into a problem due to their strict usage of the gym. they placed lots of restrictions and do not seem bendable to the guests convenience. worst so much miscommunication happens between what was relayed over the phone to the gym to the front liners. it came to the point that i have to point out a not pleasant remark made by a front officer to my minor daughter. well she must have realized the inconvenience, she offered her apologies to my minor daughter.

The restaurants are average to above average for a luxury hotel (no destination restaurants here). I however, would like to suggest some changes to their smoking policies.

However, there is an entire section where smoking is permitted, which is fine, EXCEPT that it is also the only section where one can sit and have a meal (near the bar area).

"Since I am now based in the US, For three years in a row now I have been staying at this hotel every time I visit. Also, Since I was little my Mom would also book a few nights here. The first year was excellent since my move to the US was excellent. Last year and this year was the same issue, smelly room. For some reason it smelled like someone turned the room into it's personal fitness center! Housekeeping immediately came as I reported the issue and sprayed a whole bottle of what smelled like dishwashing soap. Guy claimed it was the Shangri-La scent - Maybe it was but mixed with something else probably as it smelled no way near the hotels signature scent. An hour later, the room started smelling like sweat again. During my stay this year I spent two nights in the corner suite 504 which was totally better, once I downgraded to a smaller room 1804 my stay became smelly.

"Situated right next to 2 huge shopping malls, this is a great place to shop. We chose the location for business reasons but it is a great hotel with kids. A big water slide into the pool, other water play activities, lovely staff, great restaurants, big rooms (we had 2 adjoining for 4 of us). The down side would be a broken fridge in one room, curtains one foot short of closing in the kids' room, and a shower that didn't drain and flooded the floor. If we came here again I would choose a Horizon room (breakfast and drinks included). Proximity to the malls is walking distance, each with oodles of restaurants to choose from. Greenhills is a taxi ride away (market style cheap stuff). The staff are super friendly, professional, quick, amazing!! If you need to stay in Mandaluyong, this is the place.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La for 7 nights on a business trip in a Horizon room. I decided to stay here, as the hotel was located near my office. I pre-arranged transfers from the hotel which was easy. They were waiting for me when I landed and passed immigration.

Traffic was very bad on the road due to the rain and finally got to the hotel. Was taken straight to my room to get checked-in. Service was very good so far. I was confused as the member of staff advised the Horizon lounge will be being refurbished and the rooms, so for a few days it will be closed but can use the set-up in a restaurant. This was disappointing as I was not told of this on the website or any communication but I knew I would not be able to enjoy much of the privileges as I would be working anyway.

The spa was lovely, a nice indoor sauna/steam room and Jacuzzi. Very good clean facilities. Excellent service. The gym was great too.

Outdoor pool was okay, but they need an adults section who wish to swim. Lots of children messing around all over the pool, not a great experience for the business traveller. Service again was very good from the staff.

Breakfast was very chaotic, only reason not voted 5 star, the service was not as good as other parts of the hotel. The staff were not very friendly. They need management and training, a question I would ask is 'why would you put a business person or a single traveller next to a group of families with crying children first thing in the morning' Breakfast was amazing however, the various options and tasty food. Lots of different choices, from indian to American to fruit stations - best breakfast I have ever had in a hotel.

Room was lovely, lovely large bed. Very nice toiletries, good amenities like slippers..robes and more. A good mixture like tooth brush, shaver and more. Was quiet as well, nice views. Tv had a very good choice of channels.

I had an issue with my room, the management were very quick to resolve. The staff in the lounge were excellent, I was talking to a member of staff about 'halal food' and I did not expect to be given a print out of all the halal restaurants near the hotel - brilliant service!

Would definitely recommend the hotel and definitely would stay again if I was in the area. Really enjoyed it. Check-out was smooth and the daily transfer to my office was very convenient as well.

Location is great, right near shopping centres and places to eat close by. I felt safe and secure in the hotel. The lobby was nice and big.

I recently stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La with my wife. It was only a one night stop over stay. But we were very impressed. The only reason I haven't given a 5 is because the rooms were a little outdated. The staff are friendly and the food at Heat is AMAZING!!,Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Stayed for 2 nights in the hotel for an event. It’s everything you want in a hotel. Comfy bed, spacious room and strong wi-fi. Service was impeccable. Everyone was accommodating. The downside? The PRICE. Unless you’ll only be having water in your period of stay, then prepare yourself or prepare your wallet. An order of can of Coke costs Php 205/can excluding taxes. Yep. It’s that expensive. And to think (from what I can remember), the Coke was the cheapest thing to order. Everything was so expensive that we ended up going to the mall. And because we went to the mall, we didn’t get the chance to enjoy whatever facilities the hotel has . So I would say, its not a hotel for the budget traveler. Another downside of staying there is that they give your contact info to their Ultimate Gourmet Club service. After my stay there, I suddenly got a call from Shangri-la Gourmet Club, telling me that I was chosen as one of the VIP to be a member of this so called club. Anyway, it was a turn-off for me that they share contact info, regardless if the Club is part of their company.

Would I recommend this hotel? Yes, if you are not budget conscious because everything is expensive in this hotel.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Hotel overview:
Typically Classic luxury. Not as nice as the Shangri La Makati hotel, however you avoid all the traffic that Makati brings by staying in Edsa.
There are some nice touches from housekeeping, ie that the turndown service leaves a nice quote of the day which can be kept and used as a bookmark.
Downside is that there are just not enough lifts for that hotel! One lift was broken for the entire 2 week trip we were there, leaving only 1 elevator to serve all floors. So going to your room sees you stopping on every floor! Very frustrating for a 5* hotel.

Rooms:
A little outdated in terms of style, but still classic luxury depending if you are in the old or new wing.
ROOM TIP: Ask for a room on the 14th Floor as it gives you access to the Horizon club (a business lounge and centre). It's nothing massively special, but its a nice place to sit, it has some food and canapes everyday at 5pm. Its very similar to what you would get in a airport lounge but is a nice touch. Also they have a small outdoor balcony with some lovely flower baskert - which is nice when the AC gets too much.

GYM- brand new and open 24 hours It's amazing! Fully equipped and just incredible!

The Breakfast Buffet is incredible! So much choice! The omelette station guy is just so friendly and even got us a leaving present.

POOL: if you have kids, they will LOVE the water feature they have! The pool is lovely and the palm trees surrounding it give you the feel you are in a jungle rather than stuck in the middle of polluted Manila. (see picture) The pool staff are amazing...they never let you go without anything! Aways so friendly and remember you by name! The mango drinks are to die for as well!

"Stayed for 2 nights with hubby and our toddlers at a tower wing deluxe room. Reservation thru email and actual check-in was a breeze. Room was spacious with complete amenities for a relaxing stay.

Staff from the concierge to front desk to housekeeping to hotel restaurant (Heat) waiters and chefs to security personnel, were all courteous and accommodating.

I would like to commend the pool staff for being warm, pro-active and alert. As soon as we stepped into the pool garden, the staff was already welcoming us with 4 towels at hand and asked us where we want to place our stuff. When my son slipped on the pool side, the life guard was at his side almost instantly. He checked for any bruise or wound and offered to bring us to the hotel clinic. We politely declined as my son didn't have any injuries but we greatly appreciate his gesture. Aside from that ""minor"" slip, the kids (even this writer) had a blast at the water park.

They only do it twice a year, I guess. Anyway, I was trying to evacuate the building but once I made it to the first floor they told me I could go back to my room. I ended up in their lobby and just dying. They took me to their hotel medic who was very nice and gave me some medicine and let me rest there until I was retrieved for the airport. They even followed up with me via e-mail after I returned back home. I would say that is pretty awesome service and would probably never have that happen from any US hotel I've ever stayed at.
I stayed here a weekend while I waited to fly back to US from Davao.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
Staying at this hotel on a weekday is quite restful! Food at Heat is still fine but has lagged behind the offerings at other hotels. It is still a preferred hotel because of its central location and excellent service!,Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I've always loved staying at this hotel. I'm a local resident who loves going on staycations and this is my favorite hotel to go to. Service is excellent and they always make me feel that I'm right at home. Bedding and pillows are super comfortable and I get my best sleep on a Shangrila Hotel bed. The breakfast buffet at Heat is one of the best I've ever tried which is probably enough reason to stay in this hotel to begin with. All in all, Edsa Shangrila always exceeds my expectations when it comes to luxury and comfort!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"When invited to attend a dinner symposium and spend overnight, I almost never say no to Edsa.ShangriLa. Their rooms which have been recently renovated are so homey and comfortable. I get to choose a room with a bath tub or shower but I can.do with either. The.bathroom supplies are good as.ever. the carpets.are.clean and they smell.good. There are no.housedust mites yet. I got a tower wing room with a nuce view of the pool and nearby campus of Lourdes School. I loved the discount coupons they provided if you wanted to eat at any of their restaurant outlets.
The most awaited part of most of my stays is the breakfast at HEAT. Their breakfast.spread.is.the best.in town a wide array of smoothies and fruit selection and really freshly baked breads. Their danish pastries are so delectable i can eat forever! Their croissants are soft and flaky but not too oily. The Filipino breakfast corner is complete with tocino, tapa and different kinds of longganiza and the condiments are complete. I must compliment the dimsum counter for the wide arrAy of dumplings they serve .
Check out was a breeze. The receptionist offered the coupon for the complimentary parking without being asked (something i always forget)",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"My husband and I stayed for 5 nights in this hotel. What stood out for me was the warm ambience created by the staff. Our check-in was seamless and the guy behind the counter sent us to the lobby lounge for complimentary drinks while we waited for our room to get ready. We got a smoking room in the garden wing at the 10th floor with a nice view of the garden and pool below. The room was a decent size with a small lounge area and study. I liked the fact that the audio from the TV was connected to the bathroom so you can still hear what's on while brushing your teeth. I didn't like the slow service in the lobby lounge. I also think they could do better with housekeeping (I found a water bottle in our drawer on our first night). We got to eat lunch by the pool and the staff was at our beck and call. Checkout was pretty cool. The bellboy took our suitcases from our room and by the time I was done at the front desk, our car was ready to take us to the airport. What more can you ask for in a 5-star hotel?",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"12th floor, and a good view out to see the sun rise and set. Rooms were excellent, with everything one would need for a visit, even so much as including a toothbrush just in case you forgot your own. Two malls in close proximity, meaning shopping would be high on the list, and both easy to access from the main hotel. I was only there for a week on business, but getting back to the hotel at the end of the day was a good relaxing experience.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Just returned from five nights at the hotel, and it was bliss. The staff was uniformly welcoming and warm, breakfast at HEAT was terrific, and the room couldn't have been better. We stayed on one of the Horizon Club floors, and enjoyed access to the lounge, particularly the evening snacks and drinks. We travel a lot, and both felt that this hotel deserves five stars. We would gladly return there.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I would like to personally commend a very professional staff (Well from her looks and the way she deliver her work I thinks she is from the top management level) named Ms. Joy Santos/Reyes. I'm not pretty sure about her name but I am very impressed with the way she comforts her guests specially if there a long queue already at the lobby. I was patiently waiting that time and there is a foreigner in front of me who I suppose will do his check, Ms. Joy politely talked and assisted the foreigner and me, without expecting that she will bother to look at me because I wore Shangrila slippers that time to have a card access to a particular floor. Inches away from her and the foreigner, she softly tapped me and said ""You will be next Ma'am, will assist you in a moment"". Here in the Philippines some hotels will prioritize foreigners because for some reasons they make more profit out of them but that particular moment really made an exemptional impact of what Shangrila offers and how professional they are, Ms. Joy delivers such a noble service whether its for locals or foreigners. Indeed, to be a frontliner is a very crucial job. Thank you for a wonderful experience EDSA-Shangrila.",Staff
"Sooo love this hotel! Love everything about it! I booked in advance as my gift to my family. My father absolutely loved the decors, interiors. He is an architect so he basically scrutinized all corners of our room. Very, very clean. Newly renovated, was really clean.

My son enjoyed playing at the water park with his friend. Lifeguard was very attentive. We enjoyed the fresh fruit shakes.

Heat is by far our favorite hotel restaurant buffet. We love the spread. It has a wide array of sumptuous dishes. We always eat at Heat during special occasions.

This hotel has a connecting bridge to Shangri-la mall. it is very convenient if you need to grab something at a store, or would just want to stroll around or do some shopping, just pass through thr bridge.

"We decided to treat ourselves to some nice place for our last night in Manila and thought this Shangri-La would do. We were not disappointed.
We checked in very early, coming from the province with those dawn flights. The lady at the reception was very welcoming and at once proposed a room upgrade if we would add breakfast to our plan, which we were glad to accept (@1500php/p). Our room was ready and could be occupied right away. We already asked for a next day late check-out, connecting with our international departure late in the afternoon and got it until 15:00.
We discovered the upgraded room and it was beautiful, being a large one on the side of the building with rounded window bays. Everything was there and the bathroom with all amenities was what we had in mind when booking.
In the evening we went to the pool and lovely garden. This place looks like paradise and was very much appreciated by our little girl; many plays and water machines. We did the ultimate test: how were the french fries ordered from the poolside bar? They were just perfect and arrived warm and crispy!
The breakfast was incredible. The amount and variety of food offered is just unbelievable. This is lunch and dinner combined...
On check-out everything went smoothly, except the lady asked for a second payment of the room, as it had been paid already to the booking agency, but the misunderstanding was quickly fixed and the second payment was forgotten. Always good to remember what you have advance-paid!",Staff:Food:Value for money

"This review pertains to our family’s stay at Edsa-Shangrila hotel from Aug 4th - 6th of 2015.
This was the first time that my family will be staying with me on the hotel for a quick vacation. My previous travels
and hotel stays were purely business, and just by myself.
Since I had great experiences with Shangrila-Edsa, I decided this will be the perfect opportunity for my family to
experience the same.

Prior our stay, I already had a feeling that something excellent will be happening again. My hunch became a reality.

It all started with a perfect recommendation from Ms. Vianny Siasat of Guest Relations to upgrade our Deluxe room booking to
a Premier Suite room. She told us about an ongoing specials for upgrading to a Premier Suite at a very reasonable price.
I might not had the chance to know this if Ms. Vianny had not told us.
The room upgrade has indeed made our family’s stay more rewarding.

On the day of our check in, I decided to drive (without my driver) as I felt I already know the way to Shangrila, having stayed
there so many times, and the route taken by my driver before seems to be fairly easy.
Big mistake.
We got stuck in traffic, and I took an alternate route which I believe my driver has taken before.
Cutting the long story short, we got lost. My biggest concern is that I will not be able to make it in time for a business conference
Call which I was planning on taking when I get into my hotel room, as the international roaming on my mobile was not synching
Consistently with any of the Philippine mobile providers.
Luckily, I was well guided via phone by Ms. Vianny on which route to take. Because of her, I was able to make it just in time to
my room for my conference call.
It would have been a big business opportunity loss on our end if I had missed this. Big thanks to Ms. Vianny, whom I learned later on
had stayed past her work shift so as to be able to guide and stay with me on the phone patiently, despite the poor signal.

I also would like to make mention of Lawrence of Heat restaurant, who consistently made sure that we never ran out of coffee,
hot choco, and juices during our daily breakfast. He also proactively provided us with sliced fresh mangoes, which we felt is way
and beyond the normal service.

Last, but not the least, kudos to the always cheerful and supportive Guest Relations- Princess, Juki, Mitch, Kookie, Nicole, and
Ms. Joy Reyes.
Our hearts were touched when Ms. Joy gave our kids a farewell chocolate treat while we were checking out.

I can sense the satisfaction and happiness that my family had during our stay.
And as we were heading to the airport, my wife asked me “are all hotel people really these efficient and nice?”
I replied “only at Shangrila, only at Edsa-Shangrila”.",Staff:Food
"The girls fancied the grand lobby and it's love at first sight for them and there's a distinct fragrance once you step inside the hotel. Check-in and check-out were both a breeze. The room was a bit smaller than how we imagined it but it's enough for us 4 to squeeze in for our overnight stay-cation. In-room dining was a satisfying treat, specially their chicken congee and pork and chicken adobo. The buffet breakfast at HEAT provided a wide variety of delicacies where almost everything the family wanted to try and taste were there. I love the croissant with sprinkled almonds and a mix of something sweet inside. To top it all, I think the swimming pool in this hotel has the clearest water I've seen in all the pools I've been in my entire existence. Too bad I forgot to bring my swimming shorts but the girls enjoyed the pool and it's a blessing the weather was fine that Sunday.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Although I've been to Manila a few times, this was my first stay in Shangri-la. The staff are courteous and nice and go out of their way to help you. I was disappointed with the room size. The housekeeping staff were very nice and came in for turn-down service too. The wifi speed and coverage is good and is included in the room price. We loved their elaborate breakfast. My only disappointment was with the Indian section. We checked out very early in the morning and the hotel gave us packed breakfast! Sweet!",Staff:Food
"So far its the best hotel I've stayed in Manila. The rooms are spacious, bed is comfortable, pillows are soft as ever that you wouldn't want to leave the room. The staff are very attentive and courteous. Breakfast has a wide array of dishes you get confused on what to eat... I always look forward in staying any Shangrila chain of hotels...",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
This is my first time in Manilla and also Philippine. I joined the conference for 25 Aug 2015. I stayed 2 night here. The room was very clean. There were a desk with light and free wifi that make me comfortable to work at night. There are 2 huge shopping malls near the hotel (just 4-5 mins walk).,Location
"Edsa Shangrila Hotel is located in the heart of the city, beside two shopping malls. One mall is connected to the hotel via a walkway. There are many function rooms and convention halls which can hold simultaneous conventions.The staff are friendly, courteous, and very helpful. Although the hotel is in the middle of the city, the atmosphere inside is peaceful and relaxing because of the pockets of gardens in various areas. The room is spacious, the bed and pillows are soft and comfortable, and the view through the window is great. The breakfast buffet consists of a wide variety of international food. Transportation is not a problem because the staff contacts the taxis which arrive immediately, in 5 minutes. The Chinese restaurant serves great food, lauriat style though serving of the viands was delayed which caused my group to be late for our afternoon session of lectures. Another thing I don't like is the elevator beside the pathway to Shangrila Mall. The destination floor number is not displayed on the screen in the elevator; only a low volume and sometimes unintelligible voice announcement can be heard. When the elevator door opens, no floor number can be seen on the wall in front.
Overall, staying in this hotel was a satisfying experience.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I've always really loved this hotel. Great place to stay at. Very accessible. Clean, great service, amazing food. I love the different restaurants but especially like Summer Palace and Senju.

"I stayed here for a few nights on a business class. I found the hotel to have excellent service, a convenient location, good food and nice grounds. I ate in the restaurant for breakfast and there was an amazing selection. It wasn't included in my corporate rate and I would have enjoyed it more if it had been. I also ate in the Italian restaurant one night and it was quite good. In fact the risotto was wonderful.

I asked the front desk to look up my Golden Circle number but they never did. Sigh !

I had a massage in the spa and that was very good as well. The spa was quiet and spacious.

The hotel is conveniently located next to a large mall and I went to a hair salon there and also ate at a very mediocre Vietnamese restaurant there. There is also a Starbucks there.

I had read some of the critical reviews and was a little concerned before I arrived. I've always had great experiences at Shangri-la hotels. But they lived up to my expectations. Maybe not the most luxurious in the chain but totally fine and overall pleasant.",Food:Location

After a phone call to reception, we were asked to wait on the Club lounge floor whilst another room was arrange. Oliver the duty Manager personally came to us to apologise and give us a new room. The rooms were identical, with the 2nd one smelling much much better. Oliver was very apologetic about the first room, and we were called to follow up if we were happy, which we were. A block of chocolate was also delivered to us as way of an apology. A nice touch.
Found it convenient to be able to get to the shopping centres via the hotel.
We had breakfast on the Club lounge level. Very attentive staff. Lots of buffet items to choose from as well an ala carte menu.

"We stayed here during June and enjoyed much. The significant feature was pool! Our 13 and 17 years daughters liked this clean and big size pool.
However there was one disappointing incident.We booked two room in best rates through hotel's web site but they didn't offer the two rooms in the same floor even though we came as a family and prefer to stay in same floor. Instead they offered one best rate room and one premier room with a few thousands pesos more. That was expensive but wan't any choice. At that time, hotel didn't seem crowded and took time 30 mins to check the availability. I felt hotels should consider more sincerely guest's request ...",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"1) I booked our stay using our company's account at P8,100++ (corp. rate), including 1 breakfast but found out that EDSA Shangri-la's rate on their website is same at P8,100++ BUT includes 2 breakfasts. I was expecting the corporate rate to be the best offer or at least the same as the best offer anywhere else. To those who are not aware, in order to be granted corporate rate, your company must fulfill the agreed number of nights stay in a year. I feel that the ""corporate rate"" is deceptive and useless if anybody can get a better deal elsewhere, without any commitment.

2) I booked 2 adjoining rooms. Checked in around 12:30pm but didn't go to the rooms yet. Me and my family went to the mall across to watch a movie and to shop. Arrived in the room around 4:30pm but the adjoining doors were still locked. We had to call for someone to unlock the doors and waited for about 25 minutes. They had all the time in the world to open the doors while we were away but they didn't.

3) In general, it is a good ""family"" hotel with a swimming pool suitable for young kids. Pool personnel must be more strict with the proper swimming attire. One nanny was wearing a T-shirt over her bathing suite while a Korean mom was wearing a hoodie (yes a hoodie) while in the pool. Staff are courteous.

4) Since this is a family friendly hotel, you cannot expect to have quiet time by the pool side or have a quiet meal at the buffet restaurant on weekends. This is not a complaint but just letting people know what to expect.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"I stayed for 2 nights (July 13-14, 2015) with my wife and daughter. We were met in the lobby by Frag, who suggested an upgrade to a room with a better view. We agreed and was presented with a spacious corner ""curved"" layout room with a terrific view of the city; the additional expense was worth it. Frag and 2 other staff members surprised my wife with birthday greetings and some cake shortly after we checked-in. Very nice and thoughtful. Frag's friendliness and service made our stay memorable.
The room, however, was too cold, and I tried to adjust the thermostat but it did not respond. I called maintenance after dinner and they arrived promptly. The 2 guys tried their best to repair it for about an hour, then told us a new part was required and it would have to be replaced the following day. Before leaving, they turned off the AC but did a manual adjustment so that it wouldn't get too warm after awhile. So the first night was fine and the thermostat problem resolved the next day while we were out.
The first night we had dinner at the Paparazzi Restaurant in the hotel. It's an upscale Italian restaurant where we had a simple relaxing meal (but confirm the price of the wine if offered; I didn't and learned afterwards that 1/2 of glass of wine was $15 USD.) We had excellent breakfast (included with our room) for 2 days at The Heat Restaurant where the variety was impressive. At the first breakfast, a server came up to us twice with trays of small sized fruit drinks and small desert servings and asked if we would like to try them. We said sure. When we finished our meal and left, the server was literally running after us with a receipt and tried to explain that the drinks and deserts he offered cost extra, think it was over $25 USD. I was extremely upset by this, since it appeared that it was offered free of charge. He never stated up front that these cost extra. I went to the front desk and complained that I would not pay this ridiculous charge and that such a deceptive practice would not be tolerated. They promptly removed the charge. This event lowered my rating from 5 to 4 stars. I don't blame the staff (they are just following orders), but management should not ""nickel and dime"" patrons in this manner.
To conclude, the pool was beautiful, surrounded by attractive landscaping and the sauna facility was clean and relaxing. The hotel is situated in a crowded urban area near a huge shopping mall - SM Mega Mall.",Value for money:Staff:Food

"We had an overnight stay in this hotel. To celebrate my Fiancee's birthday month and to pamper ourselves after stress in work.

Upon checkin, since my Fiancee is a member of a golden circle, the receptionist greeted him a happy birthday ang gave us a complimentary cake and offer us a late checkout by 2pm the next day. The staff called someone to setup our room to have ""complimentary amenities.""

I'm not sure if this is one of the perks we are getting since I have someone who is member of golden circle who checke-in on his birthday month.

Anyway, the complimentary cake was delivered to our room. It was a chocolate cake, not too sweet but really delicious.

We attended an anticipated mass in a mall and when we return to our room, the bed was rearranged, added 2 memory pillows. We had 4 mineral waters addf and all toiletries was replenished and 2 oranges. In the first place, we did not request for a make-up room so we thought that these were the ""complimentary amenities."" So thank you Edsa Shang! :)

We stayed in tower room since this is less expensive than the garden room. However, this time, no bath tub for us. But its okay. The bed and pillow are too comfy that we really woke up late.

We avail a massage at the Chi Spa, my fiancee had a Yin Yang massage and mine is Wellness massage. The price is kinda expensive because its Hotel's Spa. For the facilities prior the massage, used the jacuzzi, took a bath and they even provide toiletries and disposable underwear.

What I have noticed is that my therapist wore a ""tomb raider outfit."" A short, polo and a rubber shoes. Not the typical Chi Spa staff who wear a uniform, a slacks and ang blouse which was like the one who assigned to my fiancee. I'm not sure if she is a trainee or a reliever. Anyway, the massage is good though, but I think Wellness massage is not for me. Wrong choice, I got a body ache the following day. The massage type I have chosen was a combination of swedish, shiatsu and reflexology and I even requested my therapist to adjust the pressure to soft. But still got an ouchy feeling the next day. My fiancee on the other hand had a good one. He said he was so relaxed and fall asleep. Good for him!

We had our complimentary breakfast at the heat. The hotel are full house that they had a line to queue guests, but the staff manage well. I saw a magician as well to entertain kids in the line.

For the food, its still the same. Delicious and a number of foods to choose, but I noticed the number of waiters are too few, that I requested two times for a warm water and wait for several minutes before they serve my water. They're busy because again, its fullhouse.

Even in the pool area, its fullhouse. We did not stay longer in the pool because when we swim, I tasted ""by accident"" the pool water and its really salty! ewww for me.
So what can I say? ""More chlorine please!""

The check in process was quick and easy, especially at 5am it was greatly appreciated that we could get that done quickly so I could go straight to the room, shower and sleep. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. The room had everything I needed. I only experienced breakfast one morning which was very nice. A lot of options, plenty to eat for a vegetarian. The only thing was that a girl came over to take a drinks order in which we ordered a coffee and an orange juice. Only the coffee was provided. We were wondering why she took an order for the juice when you can serve yourself, seemed a bit odd. There was a nice view of the garden and pool from where we were seated for breakfast. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to use the pool and really hope to on my next visit as it looked really nice, clean and plenty of beds around the pool to relax on. A big thank you should be mentioned to Airi on reception (I think that was her name) who assisted with late check out for me which my colleague was given but for some reason my booking didn't get updated with this when we checked in.

On arrival we were greeted by the resident manager and the front office manager. We were escorted to our room by the manager and had check in in the room which took less than a minute. The room was tastefully furnished with extremely high standards of cleanliness and attention to detail. A cake had been placed on the table wishing my wife early birthday wishes. The bed was king size with soft linen and delicate duvet. The bathroom and shower room was exquisite, with toiletries beautifully presented. The hotel itself is 1st class with 4 dining areas.

Take note unlimited to as many devices as you have. The pool area was humongous, well nit as large in sofitel, but it has full of trees and they added somesort of a small water park wherein kids can shoot water guns, stay under a splunging water and run thru a sprinklers. My kids love it so much. The lifeguards and thebperson in charge of the pool (ramson) were all very accomodating and really vigilant in looking after all the guest and kids. They even require all the kids to wear a lifevest, which me and my wife appreciates a lot. kudos to this people. Then they even have a whole day activity for the kids every sat and sun. My kids had a blast joining the activities. They even have a magician going around the breakfast area from table to table entertaining kids. it was perfect. my kids really had a good time. The food served is just typical pf hotel food. nothing special. though there are lots of food choices catering to different nationalities. The housekeeping crew was also helpful. Bed andillows were perfect. One thing that i noticed is that since it is a big hotel some of the crew are not corteous, i mean when you pass them, in other hotels they greet you but here nothing. As if they didnt notice you. not all of the staff but some of them specially in the lower lobby. Also nothing was offered to my wife who was celebrating her birthday. the receptionist said they will give something to my wife but nothing arrived. well as long as my kids had a great time, its fine with me and my wife. i highly recommend you stay in this hotel during the weekend for the kids to have a fun time.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

The hotel is located in the busy city of Mandaluyong. In between two giant Malls in the city. It is a hotel and resort with a Spa.

"We spent an overnight stay in the hotel, it has been more than 10 years since we stayed overnight. Indeed a pleasure to stay in this luxurious hotel where customer service is a delight from the front desk to the restaurant, pool attendant, housekeeping. The room is properly maintained with the essential things that we need. We were given a crib for our baby which made our stay easier and more comfortable for our little one. The first pool experience of my baby is indeed an experience, he like the warm water in the pool and the cleanliness of the surrounding plus the trees and beautiful plants. In the restaurant for the buffet, the choices of the food is excellent from appetizer to the dessert. We also enjoyed the lobby lounge where we had a merienda plus the music to make our stay more relaxing. Overall, the experience is excellent, highly recommended.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

Swimming pool was also good, I can see that it is well maintained.

I can't emphasise enough the Customer Service that they have shown to me. They were very courteous but no to the point of being too patronising. They were also quick to attend to any requests and I have never felt any attitude from them.

Still the typical 5star hotel. Room has bathtub, nice pool (but I prefer to have a lap pool instead of a kidney shaped pool).

The bedside chair is not really comfy. One thing I noticed everyone is more friendly from front desk to concierge and cleaners and guards. Breakfast at Heat is still very good, tho the coffee was not hot enough when served, it's good there was self service for coffee! Lastly, I was surprised that taxi was not readily available since there was the more pricey hotel car service, so I had to bring my niece to the busy street to get a cab! This one is disappointing bec the doorman was saying they can only call the taxi if it will pass by the guard stationed in the checkpoint area in the entry ONLY!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
We love the Shangri-La properties for their service and their facilities and the Edsa location was exceptional for all ages in our party; 2-84. Pool was very nice and the children's water play area as fun for all. Horizon rooms and lounge were nice and very accommodating. Only problem for us is the horrible traffic coming and going from the Edsa area.,Comfort & Facilities:Location
"I've stayed in Edsa Shangri-La several times and I can guarantee it is one of the best in Metro Manila. It is a 5-star hotel with some of the best accommodations and services to offer. The food here is great and their buffet has a variety of selections. Their ala carte menu for HEAT is quite limited, but since it is beside SM Megamall and Shangri-La mall there are more restaurants to choose from. Their are also restaurants located in the 2nd floor of the hotel although they are quite expensive, these are Paparazzi (Italian), Summer Palace (Chinese) and Senju (Japanese).

Their gym has a lot of equipment and it is very clean and private. They have a large pool with several ft. and a slide for the kiddie pool.

Their rooms are average size and can accommodate at least four people at most. But since the beds are quite small, only two people can really sleep comfortably. I've also tried their executive suite, which is quite large, a single King sized bed, a veranda, a small kitchen, a jacuzzi and a separate living room and dining area.

Overall it is one of the best hotels in Metro Manila with its upscale services and prime location. Recently however they have a new rule wherein only two of the occupants can use the gym and pool, which made them not very family friendly or accommodating for large groups. Moreover their staff can be quite slow when the hotel is fully booked.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"First time to stay at Edsa Shang and was glad to see that the service was on par with service at Boracay Shang. I've always thought that the lobby was a bit old and was worried the rooms would be the same but was quite glad as well to see that the rooms and floors looking completely new (probably newly renovated). Stayed in the tower wing and rooms were spacious.Usual toiletries and amenities. I appreciated the check by housekeeping sometime in the night to see if we needed anything (we did). Pool was great.The personnel by the pool were all nice and friendly. My only complaint is that since it was a weekday, there wasn't a lot of staff so we had some difficulty flagging one down to order and when we did get to order, the food took ages to arrive. They also forgot to ask us to sign for the food but it was fine since we got a call at the room and we didn't need to do anything but agree to charge it to the room. Free parking for stay in guests, you only need to ask for the coupon. Free fast wifi.
We did have some sort of incident though with the room door. We were leaving to go out for the night and I had forgotten something so I went back up to get it. My key card wouldn't work so I went to the front desk. They replaced my card with a new one which also didn't work. Asked my friend to ask the front desk again and they went up with the manager. The manager did something with the door sensor so I guess it must have malfunctioned. Nothing too serious but would have been a hassle if we were in a hurry.
Overall this is a great place for a staycation in Manila or for travelers in general. Location is great, within a business district. You would also have access to 2 gigantic malls (shangri la and megamall).",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

I checked in with my family last June 11-13. We booked for a Horizon Club Room because of the added amenities requested for a twin bed but unfortunately it is not available so instead we used the sofa bed. The rooms are a bit small but the view is fantastic. Our stay is very relaxing not to mention the staff are very friendly with a special mention to the one who assists us Ms. Jenny Paraiso of the HEAT. She sees to it that our needs are very well taken care of. She is very accommodating to us and when she had to leave us to take care of other guests she even endorsed us to other waiters to make sure we are assisted accordingly. The Horizon Club food during cocktail hours is not that impressive compare to other hotels that we experienced. The food were served in a small saucer in a food warmer which is difficult to get with a tong the saucer might slip and you cannot touch it because it is hot and that is very inconvenient however the soup taste great. We never fail also to book for a massage at Chi Spa because this is the best massage we had. The pool is also an added attraction my kids loved and enjoyed it. The check out is hassle free.

"So on business here in Manila, came to stay at the EDSA Shangri-La, having stayed in the Hong Kong one I was very much looking forward to it

On arrival hotel wanted to take an imprint of card for 1600 pounds give or take for the stay , my card is only a low credit one so I asked them to take 1300, this they then informed me would only guarantee the first 7 days instead of the the 18 days I had originally booked.... Mathematics does not seem to be a strong point

The restaurants look awesome but the one on the lower ground which should be the best as it serves a wide range of Nationalities which is called Heat leaves a lot to be desired, the food is under heat lights that dont heat the food so when you get the food to your table it is cold and almost inedible, this buffet costs in excess of 35 pounds including the taxes so better go for the A la Carte which I did not try

The pool again is awesome however if again you order food it seems to have to run a gauntlet from the kitchen in the main building, again the food arrives cold, you would think they would have some sort of thermal bag to keep the food warm on the trip but nope it comes on a tray with a waiter in the open air not covered , I find this infuriating especially when they are charing 13 pounds for a burger

Back to the hotel credit policies, 6 days into the trip I am called to politely advise me my credit is running out and could I come down so they can take a further deposit, which again I do this time they take a further 1100 pounds so bear in mind now i have paid 2400 pounds now where initially the incoming deposit would have been 1600

That night I come back to my room to find a letter to ask me to come down and part pay the bill ????? What is going on here ?? Are this hotel chain so broke they need to treat their guests as if they will leave without paying ? They have passport details they have credit card details which match and yet we are treated this way .

Dont get me wrong this is an amazing hotel but is making the things that should be relied on as great look shoddy and put you off , the room cleaning is great the lobby people very friendly but the management of this hotel leaves a lot to be desired",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities

I left the best till last: The staff here are unbelievable, right from the first welcome with an ultra-efficient room check-in to Guest relations to everyone. This is a great hotel but the staff make it an outstanding hotel and one of my favourites. The warmth and the big genuine smiles cheered me up in the morning and relaxed me in the evening.

It turns out that the room I reserved was only for a 37 sq meter deluxe one but the front desk seeing that I'm with my kids immediately offered an upgrade for a small cost and i'll get a 45 sq meter one. Upon asking if there's anything bigger she gave us a 69 sq meter suite for an even bigger upgrade cost plus the horizon.

The size was perfect for us. it had a huge walk in closet, the usual bathroom but the water closet and shower is in a separate cubicle so 3 people can use the bathroom at a time, and i'm impressed with the toiletries that they used.

"our goal for our Philipines trip was my best friends wedding about 2 hours outside of Manila. After returning back to Manila we decided that we had earned some better hotel then where we stayed before and choose the Edsa Shangri-La. After arriving at the wrong side of the Mall (please state clearly to your driver that you want to go to the hotel, not the mall!) we were welcomed by a friendly staff member. An upgrade was offered including several amendments. The executive corner-room was spacious and well renovated to the latest standards. The separate bathroom is well designed and perfect. Both bath and shower and enough space to practice a Walsh :)
The pool and outside area is fabulous, although you here the outside traffic well.
A cool extra: valet-parking is for free for hotel-guest and recommended, as the parking-garage is hard to find from the hotel. The breakfast in Restaurant Heat has all the worlds cuisines brought together and is of high standard!

negatives: several of the amendments (like breakfast and dry-cleaning) were on my check-out bill, although they were inclusive.

Typical Hotel Breakfast Buffet.

Room is spacious, newly renovated and I love the smell of their in house bath gel, shampoo and conditioner with labels large enough to read without reading glasses.,,an added convenience for guests who are above 40 years old.

Of course the shopaholics will love the hotel's location...right beside the Shangri-La mall and walking distance to SM Megamall. Though someone (govt or private sector) should start making the metropolis MORE pedestrian friendly.

I don't know Manila well enough to share too much about the location, however the traffic isn't as painful as other countries, and is always less than an hour to get to the office on the other side of the city. The service is first class and the restraints serve top quality food, the way it is displayed means it takes longer for you to decide what to eat! The gym and pool are good and the rooms are to a really high standard. The only item I can pick fault in is the service in the lobby bar, it can take an age to get served and for the many business travellers working UK and US hours, it would be good to have a more extensive 24 hour food choice.

"I stayed for the first time at EDSA Shangri-La. I usually stay at New World in Makati but my meetings required me to stay at EDSA. Although I missed New World, I had an excellent stay at EDSA.

The service is outstanding. The staff are warmer than at any hotel in which I have stayed in the Philippines (7 or so). They are also helpful, knowledgeable, and take initiative. They need to be. The hotel is a maze with poor signage.

The spa needs renovation, is very dark, hard to find, and far from reception. But, the therapist that I had was excellent and friendly; she did well at two completely different offerings. She did not rush the treatment and used discretion. When I had to miss a treatment due to ""a late in-coming flight"", they refused to charge me even when I asked to be penalized.

They gym is new, has plenty of sunlight, and has a variety of equipment. Staff are eager to assist. The front desk clerks are gorgeous (giving one an incentive to get fit!).

The cake shop at the front is beautiful with many calories on display.

The breakfast area has many options although some of the basics could be better displayed and easier to gather. On week days, the place is and feels crowded. The airport pick up and drop off were flawless.

Although I am adding critiques to my review, I enjoyed my stay very much, mostly due to wonderful service. If I must stay outside Makati, I will look forward to returning again. This hotel adds to the reputation of Shangri-La. The management deserves kudos.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed here with the family (2 adults, 2 kids) and loved the stay! Very convenient location for a last minute staycation within the city. Just a 1-minute walk to the nearest mall, this hotel mixes the convenience of mall prices and restaurants and the comfort of resort vacationing in one stay.

Check-in: Stayed in room 912. Quite fast - done in less than 10 minutes. Almost a deal-breaker hitch, though. We specifically asked for a non-smoking room but ended up being given a smoking room, instead. The room smelled terribly of cigarettes. they did send an ionizer up to our room but sadly, that already put our vacation on a sour starting note. Apart from that, the check-in process was ok.

Room: Quite small and bathroom didnt have separate shower and tub. No bidet, too. But it was clean and neat - same with the rest of the room. We got adjoining rooms (since we're 2 groups), which was nice. Good view of the pool and garden, too.

Gym: Spacious and clean. Would love to work out in a gym like this on a daily basis.

Pool: Very kid-friendly. My son enjoyed the slide very much. I liked the fact that the resort is very family oriented with lots of play areas for little kids.

Pool-side: Got really crowded during our Sunday morning visit. Almost felt like a public pool. But other than that, service is great. Try the iced coffee here - really good and pretty decent value for the money for a tall glass. Best to be here early - before 8.30am so that you can still get the good recliners. If you are late - you'll be lucky to be given a seat, if any.

Lobby : We had the flourless chocolate cake - excellent for a night cap! Attentive service and pretty quiet crowd.

Room Service: Prompt and on-time. The serving size is quite big. We ordered the set breakfast (American breakfast, i think) and another serving of the 2-eggs on a plate. that was more than enough for a family of 2 kids (8 and 14 years old) and 2 adults. I thought the cappuccino was extra yummy (for a coffee-lover like me, that means a lot).

Check-out: Equally fast and convenient. Very friendly staff.

"Shangri la continues in its goal of excellence...

At first I was hesitant to stay here because this area is typically very noisy and busy but the room i was in..executive..recently refurbished..was double glazed..so sound proofed to the noise outside...so make sure you ask for refurbished room. I stayed in 1127 at the end of the corridor..so very quiet
Very few things were issues but i have listed those for improvement below

Perfect:
1.Short walk to mega mall..one of the biggest in Manila..connected by walkway to Shangri la mall
2. Refurbished room..calming decor..large flat screen TV..bathroom very clean..had bith shower stall and bathtub
3. Fantastic pool area with tropical gardens..kids water park and slide..though this close s when dark at 6pm
4. Outside bar and restaurant..the menu here is from the Heat which is the main buffet restaurant in lobby for breakfast buffet.
5. Gym..opened one month ago ...probably the best laid out and equipped hotel gym i have been to..it was a pleasure to go there everyday. Had several knowledgeable trainers and a number of classes in early evening in the exercise room eg pilates..boxing aerobics. Ample machines...life fitness... and free weights alike
Boxing section of gym..stretching section. Free lime or lemon flavored iced water. Area with couch to read newspapers
Changing room on ground floor at entrance to gym...electronic locks..numerous shower stalls with privacy doors..sauna..steam room..whirl pool and ice pool. Very relaxing decor..massage services too.
My guess is the hotel sells memberships. Theres a business model to be had here with this gym. If they opened Excercise by Shangrila in towns with no shangri la hotel..they would undoubtedly be successful. :) i would stay at this hotel just to go to gym for weekend :)
6. Extra beds for kids without having to argue :)
7. Extremely friendly..helpful and knowledgeabke staff..always consistent at any shangri la
8. In lobby there is a coffee shop with breakfast pastries. It has a nice latte machine.this can save money as the buffet is expensive
9. A fee night with points is 2000 point here .a good deal
10. Best hotel in manila

Things to think about..(not much really):
...Metal bucket and metal spoon in sauna to scoop water...eeek what a scary scraping noise combination
....its a ways from the airport at peak times as traffic does get bad on edsa..fairly handy though to Makati
.....suggest doubling frequency of lobby toilet servicing...not clean as should be
......local residents get discount but you need to ask..usually get buffet free
..kids under 12 are half price for buffet....so still 1250 pesos..the buffet is large but really should be less 50 usd for a buffet is ridiculous
...dont sit outside at buffet..many birds will pester you
...buffet is next to lobby..trouble is the smell of fish drowns out the usual ""shangru la lobby fragrance""
....diffucult to get taxi here..dont go to main lobbyy for taxi go to lobby near gym entrance...many pass by here..u could save yourself 30 mins

This was my third time staying at Edsa and I would never stay anywhere else. Check in was so easy as they take you right up to your room and make sure all is perfect. The food and deserts are amazing. I ate mostly from the lounge and even orders to go items to take with me to work. The bake shop is amazing and has wonderful muffins for breakfast and desserts. However the most amazing part of this hotel is the staff. From the moment you step into the lobby until you leave you are treated like royalty or their best friend. I went to the pool everyday after work since we worked at night. You are greatest every day with a chair ready just for you and they are so happy to see you again. They know your name and treat you as they missed you while you were gone. The smoothies are amazing as well as the lounge chicken sandwich and Caesar salad. I was ready to go home after two weeks but wanted to bring the pool and the pool staff with me. I already miss them and the wonderful feeling I felt every time I went to the pool. This hotel is amazing and you should not stay any other place!!!,Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"I have always stayed at the shangri - La in Makati however it was full so I went to the EDSA Shang, its not quite as nice, nor is the area its in, but its still a great place and its got some bars nearby",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Edsa Shangri-La is a nice slice of luxury located in the middle of a bustling city. The hotel was very nice and had some great amenities to go with a great staff that made our stay very enjoyable.

To reach the lobby your car must pass through a security checkpoint with bomb-sniffing dogs, as well as walk pass some security agents with metal-detector type wands. It was not very intrusive at all and I actually appreciated their concern with security and I never once felt that my privacy was violated nor did I ever feel unsafe once inside the hotel.

We had three people stay inside of a room with two beds. The staff was kind enough to place a roll away bed in for the third guest and it honestly didn't feel too cramped. The rooms were very nice and comfortable and had all of the amenities one would want. There was a TV with a wide selection of channels, a safe, a modern and clean bathroom, etc.I didn't find myself wanting anything that they couldn't supply. I've stayed in a number of places and for me one of the more important things is WiFi. The WiFi here is definitely above average compared to other hotels we have stayed at in the Philippines and can easily be found in both the room and other areas of the hotel including the lobby and restaurants.

During the first night I noticed that one of the outlets by my bedside was not working so I called to the front desk and they were nice enough to bring an extension cord so I could use one of the ones farther away and still place my phone by the bed. The next morning an electrician came and replaced the outlet. +1 for the staff on that one. They were very nice and accommodating.

The new gym and sauna had just opened the month prior to us arriving and they were top notch. The upstairs gym is open 24 hours and the equipment is all very new. The wet floor downstairs was also very very nice. You can request a locker which contains towels, robes, slippers, etc. There are also showers located each in their own little room to allow for privacy. On the wet floor there is one decent sized Jacuzzi, one cold plunge, one wet sauna and one dry sauna. I went three times throughout my stay and it was never very crowded. The dry sauna is a bit on the smaller size but like I said when I was there I never had to deal with very many other guests. My only suggestion would be to add some type of non-slip mats or something by the entrance of the wet sauna. The steam makes the tile floor quite slippery and I found myself walking really cautiously after almost slipping the first time. Great facilities, though. They also have an outdoor pool which we never used. I also never had an opportunity to use their spa but the prices didn't seem too outrageous and I might give it a try if I return.

The restaurants located on site were also very good. HEAT, the international buffet, was top notch. It was a bit pricey (2,100 PHP/person for dinner if I remember right) but the food was very good. There was a wide selection including Western, Filipino, Sushi, Dessert, Cheese, Bread, etc. There was so much food I couldn't possibly try everything before getting full. The breakfast buffet was also very good and there was a wide selection there as well. The staff did an excellent job of taking care of us and I never found myself waiting for a water refill or having our buffet plates pile up.

Another night we tried eating at Paparazzi, the Italian restaurant, and we were huge fans. Of course, like expected, get ready to drop some decent cash for the meal, but we didn't find it too over-the-top expensive, and our meal was probably one of our favorites of the trip.

Overall, the atmosphere of the hotel is a bit interesting. You wouldn't expect it to be so luxurious if you see its surroundings. Like many other places in the Philippines, the area surrounding the hotel is filled with pollution and dirty streets. It is within walking distance of both an upper-scale shopping mall (less crowded as expected) and the Mega Mall which caters more to the locals (aka crazy ridiculously packed).

If I ever return to the area I fully expect to return to Edsa Shangri-La. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 was because of its price, but to be honest, if you can afford it then I would fully recommend it. If the price is right and I need to return to the area, either for business or pleasure, I will definitely consider returning.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"I suddenly decided that we should take a break on our birthday weekend. Booked our room by calling reservations at around 10am (same day of our check in,) and checked in at around 130pm. You'd expect that it would be a long wait at check in, especially because it was a long weekend with the Pacquiao Mayweather fight. Or we would have to wait for our room, but we were well in our room at 2pm. Our tickets for the Pacquiao Mayweather viewing party were also ready for pick up at the events place. They gave us nice seats too! Everyone says this hotel is great. And it is. The service of the hotel staff is what makes each stay different and special, in a way. Though we encountered some delays during the breakfast buffet when we asked for water and even asked if we can get from the bar ourselves (drinking water came 20 minutes later), everyone else at the hotel was just wonderful. Lifeguards were friendly and attentive, pool attendants, gym personnel were really helpful and encouraging. There was a cute birthday cake in our room when we arrived one night.

"There was a Chinese looking young man greeter/ front liner at the Hotel entrance who seem to have the lack of training in customer service and hospitality. (Specific time frame May 8 2015 3PM) He greets ONLY my foreigner husband and not even acknowledging I'm there. I don't think a customer has to show his/her level of education and bank account in order to deserve the usual hotel hospitality. At a physical level, I am more than aware to dress up properly because I know that I am at a respectable hotel. I don't think Shangri-La teaches their staff to profile their guests.

"The expectation was high upon arriving the hotel. Was given a room and immediately went there. Seeing that the bath had the shower and tub together, i immediately called front desk for a change in room. Was told that there are some rooms that will have either a tub or shower or both without being together. Had requested for a change / upgrade. Had late lunch and went back to the room. Had to call front desk again and tell another person my story. Again they will have to check. Later was told that the room i wanted was an upgrade and had to pay extra. I have agreed but scheduled for the next day. Next day was told that i can transfer by 2 pm. Guess what....transfer didint happen. No room.

While waiting a significantly long time it gave me the opportunity to fully inspect the room. Dried food under the sofa, stained (blood?) on the bedding (about 5 inches long), 5 pieces of hair in the sheets and finally what I can only describe as ""DNA"" on one of the decorative bed pillows. After speaking with the manager she agreed to find me another room. At this point in time I have been waiting 30 minutes to move and just told it will be another 15.

"Stayed overnight with my wife for some R&R. Its always nice to stay at the horizon rooms of the shang.

First, the not so good. Upon arrival, no one from the bell service approach us to get our baggage. I had to call the attention of someone before they approach us. Check-in was ok but it wasnt as warm and friendly as usual when you check-in at the horizon. Am not sure if booking through golden circle had this effect.

But aside from this, everything was all good. staff at the horizon would always greet us, and they are very attentive. The food and drinks at the lounge was of high quality and there are plenty of choices.

The room was good. Bed very comfortable, and internet was fast. The only thing is they dont use L' Occitane anymore as there toiletries. but its still okay.

"I conducted a program in this hotel last April 2015. The experience I had was very negative. On our very first day, we were scolded by a bellboy/concierge staff named ""Ron."" He was very rude with the way he spoke to us and he even raised his voice. We were in shock with the way we were treated.
On the second day, we did not know that we were not allowed to bring in snacks from outside the hotel. The security treated us like criminals and even humiliated us by talking loudly in the middle of the highway. On this same day, we also found out that we lost prizes for the workshop participants.
I understand that it is challenging to monitor consistency in service, however I am in shock because they have absolutely no service recovery process and the staff are very indifferent.
I think this hotel ought to focus on the way the staff treats customers because if you do not know how to take care of customers, then you shouldn't be in the service industry.

Peter and Jonathan were the only staff that assisted us and showed concern. Kudos to them.

"This is my 5th visit to this hotel in the past 2 years. I can sum up my experience here in just one word. Impressive!

Each time I have had the great pleasure of taking advantage of the Horizon Lounge and it's many amenities. From the point of booking the reservation through to my departure to the airport it is always a pleasure to interact with the staff.

After online reservation I received an email within a short period from Miejello the customer sales supervisor to inform me of a promo rate that would reduce my cost of stay.

On arrival at the airport a representative greeted me and immediately got me to my transport to the hotel. On arrival at the hotel I was greeted by one of the Horizon Club staff to escort me to my room for in room check-in. This is noteworthy since I arrived at the hotel after midnight but the Horizon Club closes at 11. She was happy and cheerful even when I apologize for my tardy arrival.

Then there is the rest of the staff in the lounge. Always greeted by name with a warm and truly heartfelt welcome. Jinnah and her coworkers go the extra mile to make sure you feel at home here. Specifically there are two lounge staff that make the stay even better. Ray and Norman even remember my favorite foods and drinks and are seemingly always right there when you need something.

From the door persons (the doorman here are two fantastic women), the room attendants, to the bell staff and the security folks, it seems as if they have a great memory for people and a true service attitude that is refreshing.

"Back in the Edsa Shang after defecting to the Marco Polo on my last trip. The Edsa Shang does feel more spacious and easier to access - not sure it's worth paying 30% more for the pleasure, but on a 5 day very hectic business visit I appreciated the quick personalised in-room check-in and the ability to get in and out of the breakfast buffet rapidly. Lots of staff around, though you need to be careful to get them to repeat back to you what you've requested, to ensure they have understood correctly. The pool was deserted early in the morning with lane ropes set up for lap swimming; in the afternoon it was very busy.

"Checked into the Garden Wing. This is an old tired buidling, nothing like Shangri La. Old bathrooms, old furniture from the last century. I did not have a shower curtain in the last 5 years in a bathroom... at Edsa there they are. We wanted to have a smoking room, they stank so much, we moved to 3 rooms... I did not want to stay in a ashtray. (In other hotels they know how to make the smell disappear....)
Planned to stay 7 nights...

Well they moved us to the Tower Wing: gave up the smoking The rooms are renovated but without any ideas or creativity. In other hotels same layout they work with glass and mirrors to break up, get away from the box design of the rooms. Not at Edsa. Renovated room nothing special besides brighter colors.

Service: went for lunch - 10 guests and same amount of waiters or more who were busy with themselves. I had to raise my voice to get attention and asked them what they were doing besides chit chatting.

Breakfast: same same and if not included very expensive.

My Shangri La experience was more like staying, waking up in a Holiday Inn express but for a lot more money.

Manila is very expensive and so are the hotels but you wonder why. The Edsa Shangri La is an average hotel with average service for top Dollars. They are cooking only with (expensive) water and I keep that in mind for my next travel, hotel plans.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"I stayed here for 2 nights. Fantastic luxury. Large, roomy rooms. Fabulous breakfast buffet. Excellent amenities, of which I only used a few (unfortunately). Gracious and immaculate service.

"Most higher end hotels are in Makati. In Mandaluyong, EDSA Shang is the only choice. I’d been to the restaurants and lobby bar in this place before, and hoped that our extended stay would be good. It is also connected to the large malls next door with a walkway, although it’s quicker to simply exit the hotel and walk across the street.

Check in was mediocre. Due to the strange arrival times with international flights, we checked in around 1 a.m. on a weeknight. We asked if food was still available in the lobby lounge. The front desk males replied that the lobby lounge was closed. It did look a little dark and deserted from the vantage point at the front desk. We found out the next night, when we went to the lobby lounge that they are open 24 hours. Indeed, we went there each night and they are definitely open all night.

Front desk service from the women was stellar. Here’s an example: I waited for a front desk person to free up. A female staffer from the side immediately walked up to me and asked how she could help. Nice! This was a pattern that repeated itself throughout our stay. The ladies who worked the front desk, lobby lounge, and other common areas were stellar, and the males struggled.

Kudos to the lady employees in EDSA Shang!

We had the standard ‘Deluxe’ room and it was spacious enough. Nice room and gorgeous bathroom. Room was cleaned spotless each day. Staff greeted you in the halls. Internet was free and fast. Laundry service was top notch and quick, as one would expect from a 5 star hotel.

We had the breakfast buffet in the Heat restaurant daily. It is a really good buffet, however we have four critiques: 1] it tried to offer WAY too much international variety, rather than perhaps a more focused local or Asian menus. 2] service was hit/miss. Lots staff around, but many tables were not bused. The leftover plates on many empty tables looked bad. Also at times coffee took a long time to arrive. 3] certain fresh fruit ran out, like mangoes. 4] In our extended stay the food choices barely changed, such that in the latter part in our trip we were pretty darn bored with Heat's breakfast.

The high end Japanese restaurant Senju in the hotel is excellent and highly recommended. And we are particular about Japanese food! Senju is expensive, be prepared to pay 2 to 4 times relative to other Metro Manila Japanese restaurants. However if you’re a Shang guest, price isn’t likely to be much concern.

The lobby lounge is the gem in the hotel. Amazing service with waitresses that kneel, extraordinary and uncommon mixed drinks, delectable food items. Superbly, comfortably furnished. In addition, there is nightly entertainment: fabulous female vocalists, a different one each night on our extended stay. They do more than sing, they interact and work the crowd. I suspect EDSA Shang selects these vocalists not only for their musical talent, but also for their personality. We spent time in the lobby bar each night. Love the place!

Also in the lobby area is a small but smartly stocked convenience store: snacks, sandwiches, gifts, wine, dessert, etc.

For what it’s worth: we also visited the lobby bar at Shang Makati. While that lobby lounge was gorgeous too, it didn’t quite have the comfortable feel as the one in EDSA Shang.

We used the workout room daily. The main workout room in under renovations, still the temporary location has more than ample machines although a little tight on space. Staff assigned to this area were really attentive.

Pool area and bar spot on for a 5 star hotel: attendants noticed us right away and made sure we were comfortable and supplied more towels than could possibly be used. Not a great pool for laps due to the shape. Still, a nice place to hang out.

We only got to try the spa once. Nicely appointed rooms / showers [although really small rooms, and the shower stall much smaller than the shower in our room], talented and sociable massage therapists, reasonably priced. One complaint: we tried to book more spa appointments, but they seemed really busy and couldn’t get time slots that worked with our schedule. Unsure if it was not enough staff or rooms. I would think that if we had difficulty to find available slots, others did too, and maybe the hotel needs to increase their spa's client capacity.

A car rental place [National] is just outside the hotel's main door, as you exit to the right. There is a shortage on taxis, and when we really needed to get somewhere the car rental place always had a car and driver available. It is really convenient, although a touch on the expensive side. We used this car rental place many times throughout our stay. Drivers all spoke decent English and extremely polite. An oddity about this car rental place: the Shang's bellmen not once suggest the car rental place. One time the bellmen had us wait 45 minutes for a taxi [third in line for 45 minutes]. I finally walked over to the car rental place and got into a chauffeured car and away in under five minutes to our appointment.

The light rail transit is connected to the mall next to the hotel. With Manila’s chaotic traffic, consider the rail transit. It is clean, airconditioned, and punctual. It will be quicker than a car most times to destinations that the rail reaches. And a great tourist experience to boot.

One item that surprised us a bit: this hotel is busy! They run many conferences. Our experiences with other 5 star hotels in the USA or abroad didn’t exhibit a busy or crowded atmosphere. EDSA Shang felt swarmed in the daytime. It was more civil at night.

It was not a perfect stay, the hotel exterior is unattractive, and expectations high when the room rate is also at the 5 star level. We do believe EDSA Shang gave good value relative to the published room rate, and give this place 5 / 5.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

Food is OK - I would say it's expensive because I did not like the taste. Very convenient to reserve a transportation. If in case you plan to bring your car ask for a complementary parking fee - they'll issue you some sort of stub. I did not visit the pool or the gym so I have no comment about it.

"Overall
It's a good 5* place no doubt. Just ask if you need something and they will respond. (4/5)

Location
Unless on a business trip in Ortigas business district, part of Pasig city, I wouldn't chose this place. Few good malls in the area (SM, Shangrila Plaza, Podium, St. Francis, Robinsons), but walking around is not recommended as it is a congested area, noisy and highly polluted (2/5).

Hotel design and Rooms
It's excellent. We stayed at 1704 room which had everything you wish. The shower is fantastic, marbled, works well and there's strong water pressure at desired temperature at all times. Fast complimentary Internet and nice city views. All you need is there (5/5)

Restaurants
There are five different places inside the hotel, the food and the service is good. My favorite restaurant is the JAPANESE on the second floor, really JAPANESE and tasty (4/5)

Pricing
Just 5*, prices are at 2 (minimum) to almost 5 times higher than outside good places but that's expected. (4/5).

Service
Overall excellent. If you bump on the guy who haven't had a pleasant day or a good night before just ignore him and find someone else to serve you (4/5).

Practical tips

1. If you stay at the cafe lobby bring a sweater with you cause the air con is strong

2. If you stay at the pool bar at night, wear long jeans and shoes or else you'll be eaten by Mosquitos.

3. If you happen to be at the hotel pick time period like Christmas or Easter just be reminded that many or too many kids will be around the pool. We love the kids but I wouldn't recommend it if you need to relax.

4. Consistency. At the lobby we were able to use my magnum shangrila discount card, at the pool bar they said that we can't because of Easter, at the Japanese restaurant first they asked and then they accepted it. I would expect that I can use this card throughout the year at all F&B shangrila place as I'm a frequent customer to its restaurants.

5. Communication. People inside the hotel speak good english and are willing but it seems to me that sometimes they don't get it. Just make sure to check that they understood what you want otherwise you will end up eating an angus beef burger instead of a fish burger like I did. Or your pasta will be over boiled while you repeatedly asked for al dente. No big deal, just check the communication understanding and you will be fine.

If you have a business trip in Ortigas business district, this is a highly recommended hotel.

If available, ask for a high level floor room with views towards ADB avenue, if not available just don't bother, all the rooms are good to great.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"This is one of the best hotels I've stayed in, and the breakfast buffet at the Heat Restaurant is second to none. Service and amenities are top notch, and safety has never been an issue. Rates are not cheap, but if you can afford it, it's definitely worth staying at this hotel.",Food:Value for money
The location was perfect for us. The staff were amazing. We needed a room near the lift and that was given to us. All our queries were responded too well. The room was clean and the facilities suitable for our needs. The bed was of a good size.,Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness

"This is my nth review about this hotel, but just had to comment about the fantastic 3 day weekend I had. We stayed at the newly renovated tower wing. The hotel was very full in terms of occupancy, but every thing was fast and efficient thanks to Cookie from front desk. The room was sparkling clean and so comfortable, Room cleaning was impeacable and they. This is the best stay I had in this hotel. The heat restaurant also serve very good breakfast inspite of its many people. This hotel has really evolved.",Food:Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities
"Facilities, especially the pool (can get crowded), are still top notch. But I hope there's more variety and value for money in the buffet breakfast and other dining options inside the hotel. Location is the best since it is in the business center and within walking distance of most big malls (Shangrila and Megamall).

Checking in and out can be slow because of the queues and surge of people. They should have seating areas for waiting and maybe they can serve welcome drinks.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I don't think I opened a door all week. I stayed here on a business trip and the service was impeccable. We requested car services and they were very accommodating, especially given the traffic circumstances there in Manila. The rooms were fully updated and to the level that you would expect from this hotel. The food within the hotel restaurants, whether for dinner or the breakfast buffet was outstanding. Even the hotel lounge area, which can often be a sketchy proposition, was enhanced with extremely comfy furniture, tasty drinks, and very nice live music. Can't wait to return!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This Hotel was a great base of operations for my week long visit for business. The room was comfortable, the facilities were clean and operated with care. The staff were willing to go above and beyond and always ensured my complete satisfaction. The pool area was excellent. Stayed in the Garden Wing which was quiet. Daily breakfast was excellent. Had a couple of issues with transportation services, which were dealt with swiftly and to my satisfaction.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness

"Edsa shangri- la is the place I stay whenever I travel to Manila and I must say that the place is nice and the staff is very helpful and nice. However I am more and more disappointed with the way they are organized and this turn the customer experience to become a queuing and waiting experience. For such highly price hotel it is definitely a major issue. The worse is probably the breakfast where you have to queue and wait for one of the few staff to bring you to your seat. It could be serious queuing, this morning it was around 20 minutes.!!!! Then your second challenge is to get a coffee which may come after more than 5 minutes... This is totally unacceptable. The waiting time at the check in / check out is probably just there to let you think about how shangri-la wants you to enjoy a little longer the place... Here as well, there are some avenue for improvement.",Staff:Food
