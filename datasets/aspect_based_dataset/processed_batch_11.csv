"Background: Jade Golden Circle. Multiple visits to SL EDSA. Work and with family visits.

- multiple emails to ensure car is booked and room type request (connecting rooms)
- car was booked for five hours after stated arrival time. Time wasted to organise hastily
- connecting rooms in tower not fulfilled despite multiple emails from SL to me

Rooms: tower
- supposed to be newly renovated but already looks worn on carpet and main areas
- very musty air con smell in hallways and within rooms
- my wife couldn't breath for the humid/ musty mould smell
- noisy. On weekends with families and weddings, every door slam, loud conversation can be clearly heard

Rooms: garden wing
- unrenovated. Worn and aged
- mouldy and humid smell. Had to request a room with a balcony for fresh air (thank goodness good days in Manila without smog)
- pay more for Horizon Floor and yet rooms still have bathtub showers with old curtains

Service remains excellent and wanting to accommodate. Concierge team is fantastic.

My last visit to edsa SL. I'll be picking a condo / apt via airbnb next time.

It's greatest days are far gone now.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"After years, I am back again in this hotel and it never aged. Properly maintained to compete with modern hotels. The pool for me is unrivaled because of the layout and the 9feet deep portion. Our hotel room is on the 11th and we are lucky to have the pool area as the view.

Looking forward to my next staycation at Edsa Shang",Comfort & Facilities
"it was once my favourite hotel in Mandaluyong area. so we booked again during the christmas holiday. Front office team clearly has a problem, the Valet system takes 1 hour and 30 mins. not to mention that you have to drive your own car to their parking area before the valet attendant would take your vehicle. then another 1 hour waiting time for check in with the line that is already extremely long, good thing our room was ready at by the time we checked in. but not as fortunate as other guest whom I've heard that their room was not. everything was slow during the holiday. room service takes min 1 hour but they would advice you if you are willing to wait for not.

Breakfast food choices remains good. they do have a lot of OJTs unfortunately they just left them hanging like zombies that they don't know what their doing, this would ruin their standards of service.

our room is missing bath tub, other than that it remains very good

and check out continue on with long waiting time.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities

"We've booked our stay at the Edsa Shangri-La during my sister's wedding last December 2016. The rooms are spacious, quick service at the front desk, fast wifi connection and great food at the Horizon Club Lounge. Breakfast at Heat was great, but do not go there at 10 am if you want to enjoy all the sumptuous dishes. My husband and son were able to swim and I had the best time at the gym. The facilities at the health club are fantastic!
I forgot 3 pairs of shoes in our room upon checking out and was really thankful for the housekeeping staff when I asked for assistance. The minor issue that I've encountered was related to my deposit using credit card. Since it was Christmas season, it took 10 days for them to credit back the amount equivalent to one night stay. Other than this, everything was perfect. Great savings too because of the early bird rate.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Beautiful hotel with great breakfast! There's so much to choose from! Facilities are clean, and rooms are decent. I would stay at this hotel more, but it's far from the Makati- Greenbelt/Glorietta area that I like to go to when I'm in the Philippines. I prefer not to use taxi less frequently when traveling here. The hotel is right beside Megamall. If you are fine with the area, I would recommend this hotel.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"My husband stays here all the time with work and I finally got to go out and meet him there; the hotel was great but do be aware that it is a city centre hotel which, with the Manila traffic can take a LONG time to get to from the airport (1.5-2hrs is quite normal) - the hotel car service met me at the airport and drove me there so I was perfectly comfortable (with air-con, bottled water and wifi!). On arrival I was really well looked after, the staff was absolutely outstanding - they had upgraded our room as they knew I was going out to see my husband, the 'regular'! The room was beautiful - huge and luxurious with a lovely pool view.
The executive lounge was great - again, each staff member was great - so happy and helpful. It was lovely to know that my husband is so well looked after when he stays there!
The gym is very good - loads of equipment. Played tennis on a roof-top court - a bit weird but fun!
The mall that is in the same complex is HUGE with everything you could possibly need - shops, restaurants, cinema, etc: Cibu Italian is great - really tasty and good value, Din Tai Fung was fab too.
I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone going to Manila.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Checked in on what must have (or felt like) a holiday weekend for a much needed birthday staycation. We got bumped up to a Horizon suite upon check in, and the room was very enjoyable although to the discerning guest you will see minute signs of aging.

We have a lot of business lunches at HEAT so it wasn't really any much big of a surprise - food spread was top notch as expected. Just too many people during this particular stay, like that feeling where you inadvertently walk into a fully booked convention weekend. Never saw the Horizon Club floor lounge packed with so many people haha, like there was a promotion or something.

Overall, still a very good experience and still the best luxury option if you are staying in Ortigas.",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"It was a thursday morning. Met up with a family friend for breakfast at one of their reaturants that serves buffet. Food was fine and with good array to choose from. What i like here is their staff.

We had an excellent end to end customer experience. It was easy to book online. Check-in took less than 5 minutes. The room was clean and had a relaxing interior design. The pool had a very nice tropical layout with a small waterpark for kids and we felt safe with the three attentive lifeguards. The restaurants served delicious dishes. The staff were courteous and warm. Check-out was quick and easy. We felt like we got what we paid for.,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"My rating is based on the service received at Chi spa. My gf brought me here for my birthday. We were in the couples room. While she was being massaged/rubbed with one hand the therapist was texting with the other. She then drops the phone between her legs to continue massaging with both hands. This continued throughout the massage. Your massage therapist texting? Chi spa? Really? This is what we'd expect from a local gym that offers massages at p350 ($8usd). Not Chi Spa!

Before noticing such a decline in service, this was the spa we'd frequently visit & treat each other for birthdays. Being completely dissatisfied she decided to complain by writing the company. She was given an apology (sorry) and told when she comes back they'd make sure to do a better job. What? Come on Shangri-La! At least they could've offered her another massage. A 90-120 min massage at this place is pretty costly. Paying for two massages then leaving displeased is a terrible feeling. This was basically a waste of hard earned money & time on a special occasion!

I feel they should pay more attention to satisfying customers rather than taking the money. This is not the Chi Spa of the past. I just had this conversation with a friend of mine and his wife who also frequently visits Chi spa. They said the same exact thing ""Chi spa is not the same.""",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Love this hotel! People are great, the ambience is perfect, very relaxing after a hectic day of shopping! Love the Chi spa, visited it again this time around. The couple's massage dressing room was lovely! Service was wonderful, like the first time. The HEAT restaurant is always fantastic and special thanks to our server, Alex. He was so attentive, friendly and a joy to have assisting us with our breakfasts! Best coffee I have had in all my travels, up there in my list with what I enjoyed in Barcelona. Keep up the fantastic service, we will definitely come back a third time when we visit again!",Staff:Food
"We booked a Garden Wing Horizon Club room. The room was clean spacious enough. Cable channels were available. However, there was no bidet on the comfort room. The bottled toiletries are hard to squeeze. It will test your patience. Please do something about this. You need to tip and hit the plastic bottle again and again to get lotion or conditioner.
The check in was a disappointment. Horizon Club guests are suppose to receive a private check in and this did not happen to us. We were checked in like a regular guest,lining up, standing and answering questions.
The Horizon club was full because it was Christmas. The staff tried to be friendly and accomodating, though you could sense it's not that sincere. The is no freshly brewed coffee available, only expresso machine with coffee capsules. For guests with gall bladder stone issues, instant coffee is bad. However, I was impressed that during cocktail hours, the food spead was very filling, from rice, lamb chops, to cheese and margaritas. The soup was not hot by 6pm. The lounge may get very busy and with crying toddlers, I fully understand this, for this hotel is loved for being a family hotel.
Housekeeping did not fully replenish the toiletries.
The pool was clean. Towels and requests took so long. Presence of lifeguards is a plus.
There is a quick passage way from the hotel to the mall.
The lobby was very beautiful. However, the snowflake show was late by 30 minutes and it was pathetic. You have to order food or drinks to be able to sit at the lobby lounge.
The buffet breakfast at Heat was chaotic. Again, it was Christmas morn. The food was messy and the coffee came after 3 follow ups and a stern tone. They ran out of tables so people had to line up and wait. The next morning was a releif, less people, more attentive staff and more appealing array of food.

Over all, it was an experience but next time we will opt for the other Shangri La hotels in the metro.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I've always been a fan of Shangri-La hotels around the globe but was surprised when I opened the pantry drawers and found them empty. What's worse, the glasses were covered in dust!

On a side note- I was used to getting complimentary fruits, water and tea on each visit but this time got nothing.

No housekeeping service provided unlike before.

It would have been nice to get something since it was holiday season especially since I'm a Golden Circle member.

The staff, as always, were very pleasant.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This hotel is situated in a location where you are close to one of the biggest malls in Manila and has a mall within a 3 minute walk from the hotel main entrance. In addition, you can catch a hotel cab to greenhills and you will get there in about 15 minutes. The food is amazing as you can either order from a comprehensive menu or simply get the buffet. I did a litttle of both during my stay due to in the evenings I was more in the mood for an egg breakfast off the menu than crab or some other amazing dish they had at the buffet.

The hotel also has a very nice lounge around both upstairs on the 10th floor I believe where you can relax, have some tea and enjoy some time out of your room if you so choose. The lounge near the front desk is amazing with every drink you can imagine available or purchase and well decorated while overlooking the beautiful pool and grounds they have outside.

I had the opportunity as well as enjoying the SPA while I was there and the service was amazing. Very professional staff and a very rich look and feel to the facilities. I much enjoyed this Spa service over one I recently had in Bangalore India at an upscale hotel there. The cleanliness and facility were impeccable.

The front staff were very knowledgeable and accomodating and I felt were very well versed in dealing with almost any situation. The same goes for the very busy, but well trained staff who are caring for individuals getting hotel cars etc out front. I would suggest booking your car service the day before if possible so you get the time you want - it is extremely busy there at times which lines up pretty much with the entire traffic situation in Manila :).

There is secure keys for this hotel as well, meaning the floor you go to is programmed into your card, no matter what level you are getting off at which is added security I like when I travel alone internationally. In addition, your bags are checked every time prior to going into the hotel, the cars going into the location are checked and all guests and visitors enter the metal detectors. I prefer this level of security, it is needed in Manila. Basically, you can do pretty much anything you need to do while at this hotel - swim in a beautiful pool, go to a wonderful spa, get a reliable car service, enjoy a lounge or wonderful meal and get out for some nice, upscale shopping without much trouble. Most any international traveller would feel this hotel makes the mark in terms of comfort, accomodation and security.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Our whole family spent New Year's Eve and New Year's Day at the hotel to get a break from the hectic New Year preps, and I have to say that the management and staff really went the extra mile to make our stay enjoyable. I was actually dreading it a bit coming from our experience at the same hotel last Mother's Day where we were able to check in at about 5pm already, but this time they planned everything very well. They allocated an extra room near the lobby to handle check-ins, so the lines were surprisingly manageable and our rooms were available on time. In spite being at full capacity, in-room dining orders likewise came on time. They were also very accommodating of requests... after a quick run to Rustan's to get grapes, only to see a sorry lot of old, rotten ones, we asked if they had any grapes to spare and they sent a plate up immediately. I also found it very considerate that they allow people to order food from outside establishments (I saw deliveries in the lobby, you just needed to go down and pick them up). Come breakfast, they opened up 2 additional ballrooms to supplement HEAT, which was why the line was again very manageable. Most importantly though, kudos to the entire management and staff for really excellent service. You wouldn't be able to tell they had to work on New Year instead of being with their families, everyone was friendly, efficient, helpful and all smiles. A special shout out to the staff assigned to the Horizon Lounge (especially manager Hisa), they remained friendly and unfazed even when some guests weren't as polite as I expected everyone to be. Thank you again for everyone in the hotel who gave service above and beyond what I expected! Its precisely the people that make EDSA my favorite Shangri-la property in Manila :)",Staff:Food
"We stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La for 4 nights. We flew in early (from Los Angeles) so we had to purchase an extra night so that we could use the room before check in. This is one of several Shangri-La Hotels in Manila and I don't think it's the best location. Very busy area and we didn't feel all that safe walking around. We had a driver pick us up and take us to tourist locations. The traffic is horrific!!! We stayed in room 1719 with a view of the mall roof. The breakfast (included) was excellent. The king bed was comfortable. There was no tub in the bathroom, very low lighting in the bathroom and no outlet for hair curler.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Knowing that pre new year stay here can be chaotic due to the very high occupancy, I requested for 12 noon check in which was perfect thanks to Malen Sebastian who personally made sure it was fast. This time, they had another back up for checking in to make sure it was fast. Room was great as usual, staff were very courteous and alert. The check out was also fast. By way of suggestion, to better control the incoming traffic, have someone in charge, take care of van full of people, give them a space in front so as not to block the traffic, van can take up to 15 minutes blocking up coming cars with only few guests.",Staff

"I was finally able to get a much needed getaway from the hectic Christmas rush with the family. My wife, daughter and I checked in December 26 for a two night stay. I was able to book through a promotion of BDO credit card which offered the room with buffet breakfast for three for a discounted rate.

The lines for the check in were quite long but that was expected because of the holiday season. The Front Desk staff more than exceeded my expectations with their genuine service despite the long wait. They immediately offered us late check out as a gift. That was a nice touch.

We preferred the Garden Wing rooms even if it was a bit farther. The area is quiet. The room is clean and the bed was very comfortable. My daughter immediately checked the bathroom to check if there was a bath tub, she was so happy to find it there.

My daughter immensely enjoyed the pool area. The pool attendants were very engaging and safety was never an issue since their personnel were very alert. One aspect of the pool that my daughter loved so much was the water slide. She swam three times during our entire stay!

My wife and I enjoyed the facilities of the fitness center. The hot tub was particularly very relaxing. The sauna and the showers were very clean.

We enjoyed the room tremendously because it was so quiet inside. One drawback though, as I also mentioned in a review of Makati Shangrila last year, was the quality of the TV reception. In the age of High Definition TVs, this is one aspect the hotel has to take care of.

For the breakfast buffet, I found it so-so, as compared to Makati Shangrila or even Oakwood Joy-Nostalg. It was not just that good, I was disappointed that they did not offer the laksa in the breakfast buffet, I was looking forward to that.

Overall, it was an excellent stay, but just a bit peeved about the breakfast buffet since it did not live up to expectations. If there is another good deal to be had here, I would definitely book again. Happy travels!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Crowded, maybe because its holiday season yet they were able to provide an excellent experience for us. I would recommend getting a Horizon Club room so you can enjoy more benefits, you can even have breakfast there which I prefer coz I have kids and I saw the long lines of people for breakfast in HEAT. We spend Noche Buena in HEAT and I'm not very impressed, Cafe Ilang-Ilang of Manila Hotel is way better.

"Pros:
Conveniently located

Cons:
Queue for check-in was a while. I was called to a counter only to be asked to fall in line again. The front desk staff did not appear to be so coordinated.

I used Agoda to book. I usually just present my ID. But the front desk was insisting I present a printed out voucher which I did not have. She stubbornly insisted I needed one. Good thing the manager approached and informed her that I need not present a printed copy, that it's not necessary.

The lobby and elevators were very smelly and reeked of fried fish! A few other visitors noticed the smell as well. It felt and smelled like a market.

Room service for just a GLASS of WINE took 30 minutes!

We found a cockroach milling around in our room and we had to endeavor to kill it.

Tub wasn't as clean with questionable stains and fixtures were rusty.

Dinner was cramped at Heat. Only good thing was our server, Lawrence. The tables are very close to each other you could actually hear the person in the next table chewing. Not a classy restaurant at all.

Breakfast was worse. As usual, cramped cramped cramped. We had to ask the server for a glass of water twice. Disposable table napkins also took a while to be given, I assume they had to rummage for it.

The gym staff was terrible too. I did not get headphones, had to ask my fellow gym goer where she got hers. Apparently they offered it upon registering. An added hassle was that notwithstanding the fact that you're checked-in you still have to register your companion guests with the front desk where the line was so long. This is a first. I've visited other Shang properties, we weren't asked to do the same. Worse was when we dropped by to check out the gym prior to using it, we werent informed of their registration hullabaloos. These procedures unnecessarily hassle the guests instead of making them feel welcome and appreciated.

Edsa Shangrila was an expensive mistake. Should've booked with other nearby hotels for less. Added disappointment and stress.",Staff:Food:Value for money

"CHECK-IN- I called a few days before my stay and requested a non-smoking room and a humidifier as I was sick during my stay. Upon check-in, neither request was noted so I had to request for them again. Thankfully, Mitch(?) was able to secure all of them and even gave me an upgrade to the Tower Wing. I requested for a king-sized bed and a bathtub and they were swiftly handled by the receptionist. Check-in was fast but it somehow felt all business. I even tried to make small talk and the reply was polite but curt.

ROOM- Spacious, clean, and comfortable. The bed was immaculately clean and the comforter was superb! The pillows were perfect and they even have a pillow menu which is good if you have a specific type of pillow in mind. However, the menu for the In-Room Dining was absolutely hard to find. I hadn't eaten lunch at that time and wanted to order room service but the menu was ""hidden"" in one of the work drawers. I felt like I was doing a scavenger hunt. When my food came, I noticed that there was some ketchup or some sort of stain under the glass of the table. There was also a dirty handprint on the wall near the AC.

BATHROOM- The bathroom and bathtub were squeaky clean and I did not have any second thoughts of taking a long hot bath in it. HOWEVER, much is to be said about the toilet. I expected the toilet to be more hi-tech, or convenient at the very least. The bidet's pressure was difficult to control and there was only one setting. The water temperature (hot and cold) was good.

POOL BAR- We wanted to get a drink at around 10PM but no one assisted us. The girl at the bar was just looking at us and didn't even tell us that they were already closing. The poor guy arranging the chairs was the one to break the bad news to us.

BREAKFAST- We had buffet at HEAT. The food was excellent and there was a wide variety of dishes. But the service...oh, the service! Coffee took 10 minutes to be served. Water took about 5 minutes. Genesis, one of the servers, was fast and attentive, though.

**All in all it was excellent but something was missing. Something that made the stay feel personal and warm. I felt like a paying customer there instead of a welcome guest. The only time I felt the warm Shangri-la service was when I was checking out and the lovely lady who asked about my stay and genuinely smiled. Nothing was terrible, really. I would still stay here again and recommend it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"We stayed overnight to try the shangrila brand. I was not dismayed. From the checkin counter to the moment you leave the hotel, everyone was so hospitable. They greet you with a warm

EDSA Shangri La was opened in 1992 and was the first Shangri La to be opened in Philippine. It is a 5 star resort in the heart of downtown Manila. This was the first time I stayed here. First impression was its huge. I stayed in the Garden Wing on the Club Floor. Despite the property being 24 years old it has little signs of wear and tear. The room was spacious and the bathroom well stocked. The Club was nice and I had a few meeting there. There are several restaurants in the hotel but next to it is a huge shopping mall where you have many other choices. Overall service was good; staff was excellent. The Phillipinos are really up there when it comes to hospitality. Shangri La has over the years been home to the Asia business traveller and you pretty much know what to expect. Standards have not changed much,Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"I booked a block of rooms for my wedding as our venue was close to the hotel. I had stayed here years ago for work a few times, but hadn't been back since then. I remembered this hotel being top notch.

GOOD:
- the service is great, and everyone is so courteous and welcoming.
- the rooms are nice, garden wing a bit dated, but everything was clean.

BAD
- the breakfast is overrated. HEAT (the bfast resto) is packed by 8am, a microcosm of Manila traffic on a Friday afternoon. Too crowded to be enjoyable. The food was just ok, and not how I remembered it. Those are not scrambled eggs...

WORST
- I had booked a block of multiple rooms for a one night stay. I called later and changed the block to two nights, and when they resent me the confirmation, the rate quoted for the first night increased by 25%. I also changed the names on the rooms so that our friends and family could check in themselves.

Well when we checked in I asked if we get could the original rates back, as I didn't think it should've changed if we just added a night. They wrote me an email later, after some research, and stated that they had mistakenly booked us with the ""local resident"" rate, and that they could not give me back the original rate, after learning that I was not a local.

Well my wife, from Manila but lives with me in Hong Kong for the past 7 years, had other rooms booked under her name, and she got the local rate. Her uncle, who has lived in Australia for the past 20+ years, also received the lower rate. So basically it was just our white friends that had to pay +25% on all the room fees. This seems not fair, and where I'm from, maybe even discriminatory and illegal.

I expect to be ripped off by the taxi driver for being a non-Filipino, but I expect more from a international 5-star hotel brand. If you want to encourage more locals to stay in your hotel, then I would recommend running promotions in the local papers, or offer discounts for local credit card holders. Or even if you mistakenly offer a local rate to a non-local, you should bare the burden of that mistake, and certainly not offer that excuse as the reason for the rate change. I had already quoted the original prices to my friends who had confirmed the rooms.

I will not be staying in any Shangri-La properties from this point forward. I'm canceling my Golden Circle membership.

The Marco Polo Ortigas is right around the corner, offers cheaper rates, is much newer, has a beautiful bar on the top floor, and has never made it known to me that I was paying a different price than any other person staying in the hotel.",Value for money:Staff

"This is our second time at EDSA Shangri-la and this time we chose a room from Tower Wing. It has a modern vibe unlike room from Garden Wing, but view is not that nice since it's facing Megamall's old roof deck/parking.

Check-in: Fast and hassle-free since the attendant immediately seen my reservation. She even allowed me to deposit just 1500pesos since I don't have enough cash on-hand. I offered my card but she insisted that it is enough and that I can get the cash easily upon checkout compared to reversing the charge using the card.

Room: Spacious enough for the three of us. King-sized bed is very comfortable and cozy that Sav kept on rolling and rolling. Everything we need was there. We had a good night sleep.

Dining: We always look forward for the buffet breakfast at HEAT. As always, food is superb! Sav loves their beef congee.

Amenities: We love the resort-feel on the pool area. We just waited for the sun to come up so the water will be somehow heated since it's too cold for Sav. After our 30-40min swim, she instantly fell asleep. Good thing that there's a n easy access from pool area to elevator lobby.

Check-out: Fast and hassle-free. While on queue, we were already assisted by lobby personnel and provided car-pass so the valet personnel can already pickup our vehicle in advance.

Service: Staffs are all attentive, well-mannered and presentable-looking.

Value for money: You get what you pay for but good thing that I was given a corporate rate!

Overall: We had a wonderful stay and will definitely go back! Thank you EDSA Shangri-La Hotel :)",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

All this happened before my eyes. I freally felt bad about it. Very hungry and still waiting for my order. When it was served it wasn't what was p[romised to me by the waiter who took my order.

"I chose to stay in Edsa Shangri-La Hotel's Horizon club suite. I was curious about the exclusivity and privacy of having to stay in one of the suites. Filipino hospitality is really evident in Edsa Shangri-La, from the porter, to the check-in counter. Let's start with the good one first, the location of the property is great, it is centrally located and you have access to the train system and other public transportation. The property is connected to the Shangri-La Mall and a few steps outside of the hotel ... guess what, another mall. Staying in one of the Horizon club suite, gives you access to the Horizon Club Lounge where you can have breakfast, afternoon tea as well as evening drinks and hor d'oeuvres. Aside from this, should you wish to take your breakfast in the Heat restaurant, you can do so. One should remember though, the Horizon Club Lounge, the menu is limited ... you have a buffet spread and al a carte that can be ordered. The Heat restaurant have more choices. But if you want to have a quiet, personalized breakfast, the Horizon Club Lounge is the way to go. I find the Heat restaurant really crowded especially during my stay which was a long weekend due to the holidays.
The housekeeping staff in the Horizon club were impeccably attentive. They deserve a raise.
The suite that I stayed in was a bit dismal though. The facilities are dated, I really don't think they have upgraded the room facilities for a long time. The power outlets were limited, I only had 2 available on the study/office table ... which in this day and age, most of the items a traveler brings are rechargeable, it will be a nice idea to add 2 or more power sockets in the room. Bidet shower was also not available in the bathroom, which most 4 star or even 3 star properties have this. Upgrading the shower will also be great given the price paid.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"We, a family of 4, stayed here for 2 days. The room and services did not disappoint! Although price is quite on the expensive side - about php 9-10k per night, you really get what you paid for. The room is of average size, beds were comfortable, the restroom was with complete amenities/toiletries save for a bathtub, and it is the first time I saw a toilet bowl with press-on bidet. The swimming pool was the best part, with the kiddie play area. The breakfast buffet at Heat was really great with so many choices- for sure with the many choices, one would never taste every dish served there!
Location is really good with 2 malls - Shangrila Mall and SM Megamall within walking distance.

"Shangri-La hotels are noted for their luxurious accommodations and excellent service. The EDSA Shangri-La Hotel is no exception. This hotel is located strategically in Ortigas Center, in the middle of Metro Manila. It has quick access to EDSA as well as the MRT station. It is also adjacent to two great malls - Shangri-La Mall and SM Megamall. If shopping is your thing, this is the right place to stay in.

They have a resort type pool with play section for kids. However, since I stayed here during a long weekend, it was a bit crowded as many families were booked for the Halloween event. Also, there was a long wait to enter Heat restaurant for the buffet breakfast due to their high occupancy rate. I ended up in the mezzanine where they set up an alternative breakfast area. However, the spread there was not as good as in the original resto.

This hotel also boasts of at least 5 food outlets serving Japanese, Chinese, Italian, and International cuisine. You have plenty of options if you choose to dine in the hotel. But since it is adjacent to big malls, you also have a myriad of other eating choices there.

Another notable feature is their fully-equipped gym. It is quite spacious and they offer free classes for guests. It includes tyboh, pilates, kickboxing, among others.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

1. The hotel greeter insisted on making us check in at the front desk, while our package entitled us to check in directly at the Horizon Club Lounge. When I advised her about our arrangement, she said that she does not know about such an arrangement.
2. The pool attendant did not provide us with towels even after 1 hour after I asked. Consequently, when my kids finished swimming, they had to return to our rooms and pass through the hotel lobby soaking wet.
3. The email confirmation sent to us indicated that high tea at the Horizon Club Lounge starts at 11am, but the sign at the door of the Lounge indicated high tea will be served at 2pm. It is the latter which they observe.",Staff:Food

"What a marvellous hotel! We booked two adjoining rooms in the Edsa Shang for my self, my wife and younger daughter Renay to catch up with our elder daughter Yvette and her 6 year old travelling companion daughter Emmie who have ""left home"" in Sydney and spent the past 8 months experiencing lifestyles in Asia while enjoying valuable Mum and daughter time along the way.
We had not caught up with with the intrepid wanderers for several months and the ""Shang"" we and truly suited our needs to the nth degree.
The hotel was built in the 90's but it has had makeovers that keep it to the fore front of its 5 star peer international hotels.
The hotel features a great pool complex and a childrens' water fun area and slide. The area is continually monitored by trained staff to keep all pool users safe. Fresh towels are provided and the staff are kind and considerate to patrons' needs.
The wet bar is open for an extended period every day and food orders are cheerfully taken and delivered with beverages of your choice.
Our room was on level 7 providing a view over the pool area, and was efficiently serviced every day. The room's furnishings and appointments were of very good quality. The location was quiet and relaxing.
There are several restaurants on site, and we chose the the Summer Palace Chinese Restaurant. Highly recommended. We celebrated a family birthday and decided to include Peking duck among our orders. It and the entrees were beautifully presented, and everything was perfectly cooked, and delicious. Chefs, we salute you.
We minded our granddaughter for most days due to her Mum's attendance at a bloggers' conference in Manila, and a trip to the movies, kids zone and toy shops were so close due to the adjoining Mall that we barely had to leave the hotel premises.
I used the well equipped and modern gym on several occasions; it was probably the best appointed gym I have used for a long time.
Breakfast each day at Heat is certainly recommended - the staff again, excellent, and there was even a magician to entertain the children on the weekend.
One last thing, paying just a little extra to gain entry to the Horizons Club is a no brainer.
Excellent food, drinks, service and comfort is assured for breakfast, afternoon tea and later afternoon (5pm to 7 pm is happy hour)- it is also a godsend to the traveller who arrives a an odd hour.
A big 10 out of 10, Edsa Shang. And BIG wraps to your wonderful staff through out the hotel. And special mention to Ms Hisabel Alfonso and her amazing team at Horizon Club. Once you meet them you will want to return.....soon.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"We stayed here to celebrate my son's birthday. My kids (age 10&11) are able to stay for free. Since we have quite grown up kids we had time to check out the health club. It was well-maintained. Towels, water, soap and toiletries were provided. All machines: steam, sauna, cold dip and jacuzzi were all working and clean. I've tried them all and attended the classes. This experience was the climax of my stay. I was so relaxed after working out, and using the bath facilities.

We we're greeted by courteous staff in all areas.

I wish they had let us eat some of our breakfast meal in the pool though because i'm watching my kids. Also, the restaurant was packed. There was a long line waiting. It was at least 10-15 mins of falling in line just to get in and get breakfast.

There was a halloween party the night before so there's a lot of kids and guest in the lobby when we arrived. They we're so cute it was entertaining not bothersome.

The check out was fast as well as the check in.

The beds were soft and comfortable. The room was well lit. There were toiletries available. We have enough towels but only one bathrobe but it was provided on request. They gave free water and attended to all queries sufficiently. We only have a few sugars and one set of utensils. The clock on the side table is not working.

The pool was huge and entertaining. The slide needs to be replaced because my kids keep getting stuck at the end just before the drop (it could be intentional for safety reasons). There were life guards everywhere and staff were all actively watching guest.

They gave my son a free birthday cake.

So all in all we enjoyed our stay. It was entertaining, filling, relaxing and worth it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

Okay, this hotel may not be new but what will you gonna do with a new hotel if the total experience is not worth it! I tell you, this hotel is really really worth your cent!! I have to salute their staff for being so accomodating and hospitable.

This time, my family stayed in two of their rooms under Horizon Club and the cost is really worth it. We were able to enjoy the cocktails from 5 to 7pm plus the breakfast. Not only that, for breakfast, I have the option of having it either in HEAT or in the horizon club (unlike other hotels). How cool is that!! It is also open 24/7 so if you like to drink tea or coffee at midnight, you can just go to Horizon and drink your coffee or tea or juice. Aside from these, you can borrow board games, request for microwave oven or espresso machine inside your room or even borrow their wii or Xbox! There are also rooms in Horizon club for you to do your teleconferences or meetings.

I definitely recommend the horizon club rooms. And again, thank you to Edsa Shangri-la, most especially to the people from Horizon Club for making our stay enjoyable! See you all again on our next stay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

The girl says the usual 600/800 price, she asked if I've played there before, I said yes. She dropped the bomb on me by saying there's also a walk in fee of 2000 or 2200 on top of the 600/800 per hour.. I have to laugh at the price.

"Ok, except for location, I don't know why anyone would choose the Makati iteration over the EDSA Shangri-la. The lobby layout is roughly the same, but the facilities, food and price are better in Mandaluyong. Unfortunately, with traffic, location does matter in Manila and unless you're going to be hanging out at the Asian Development Bank, there's less here than in either Makati or the Fort. But, if it doesn't matter to you, EDSA is the place to be.

In particular, I wanted to note how impressed I was with the gym. Not only is it 24 hours and equipped with a wide selection of cardio machines, it also had an impressive complement of boxing equipment if that type of cardio is your thing.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food

"Truly a Tropical Garden Retreat in the Heart of the City. Stayed here last September 30- October 1, 2016. I felt the stay was too short. The experienced staff at EDSA Shangri-La, Manila, caters to the needs of guests by providing an extensive range of services and facilities. We fell in love with our Tower Wing Room that offered magnificent views of the Manila skyline. My daughter love the hotel's swimming pool. It is both kid and adult friendly. Buffet breakfast at the Heat was wonderful. Good array of food choices like fresh fruits, assorted breads and pastries, egg and noodle station, salad bar, Japanese station and TAHO! We would definitely be coming back soon. Kudos to the management and staff!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

We checked in and were offered an upgrade for a reasonable price that included club room, canapes and drinks in club lounge, buffet breakfast in club lounge, and late checkout. As you would expect the food and service were first class. Wife was extremely happy which in turn made me happy also. Overall it was a little expensive but worth the extra.
Club room was outstanding, everything you could ever need was included, staff were outstanding. We didn't get a chance to use the pool but it looked very inviting. Next time perhaps. Overall a 10/10 experience.",Food:Value for money:Staff
"From the moment you walk into the Shangri-la, you can feel the classic elegance, yet it still has a welcoming atmosphere. The food in the lounge was very good as was the tea and wine buffet.

It also has the nicest gym I've been to so far. I was impressed that with the equipment as it was top quality and they even offered several types of healthy drinks you could get for free.

The pool was also one of my favorites because it was deep enough for a shallow dive, long enough for a workout and had some curves to make interesting. The place really is as they call it, a city resort.

The location is also fantastic if you want to visit Megamall or the upscale mall Shangri-la plaza.
The buffet was scrumptious with loads of choices so I'll be back for that.

The Internet connection was very stable and strong enough for a Skype call using my mobile device on their wifi.
I wasn't able to run a speed test so I'm not sure if it's strong enough for doing live webinars where you need loads of upstream. I'll test the next time I return, which I hope is soon.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"Having stayed at some other hotels in Manila, this turned out to be the jewel in the crown. I did not miss the mantle above the employee entrance which was talking about customer service and attitude. That seems to like infuse some magic in every employee from in room dining to reception to bell desk to restaurants to the chefs to the fitness center staff....there was not a single area in the hotel where I missed that employee smile and willingness to make your stay pleasant.
The fitness center along with the Jacuzzi, sauna and steam room are perfect relaxation after a long hectic office and a run on the treadmill. The staff at the fitness center really make you comfortable, coach you and ensure that you are enjoying yourself.
Its a great place to visit with family and kids, with a large swimming pool and fun wet area. Bonanza for Indians is a great Indian chef ensuring you don't miss your desi taste.

"Hotel offers a resort style experience in the midst of Manila busy streets. Hotel rooms it's self looks fairly dated in styling but where it makes up is in the service.

All staff from front desk to house keeping is very friendly and helpful.

Hotel is located (connected via a link bridge) to the Shangri-la plaza. The shopping centre does have a mix of brands from Zara to luxury fashion. It also has a significant number of food outlets and cinemas.

If you are planning to stay in the hotel the spa is a good choice. The gym is also fairly extensive and the pool is large and accomodate adults as well as kids.

"Looking on a map, Edsa Shangri-La appears very close to everything, right in the middle of Metro Manila, however, it is not until you get to the hotel that you realise how far away it actually is! Three hours to get from the airport, about 5km, to the hotel - it's just crazy!

Enough of the time-spent getting to the hotel, though, this is no fault of the hotel's and cannot really be controlled by them. The hotel itself is beautiful as one can (and should) expect from Shangri-La; the services is wonderful, too. The biggest let-down, except for the time to travel to the hotel from the CBD & Airport, is the expense.

Everything is fantastic in the hotel and I am very impressed in all respects, but next time I come to Manila, I will be staying in Makati - just that little bit closer to the airport and right in the heart of the business & entertainment district.",Location
"One of the best five star hotel in Metro Manila. I have seen every part of this hotel as I have attended a lot of conventions, stayed for leisure and been an organizer for a couple of exhibits as well. So yes, I have gone to the back door and the front door. I must say that this hotel has never failed to disappoint me for every time I visit it, it feels like a paradise. You better book months in advance as rooms easily go unavailable once there is an upcoming event. What I like the most is the ambiance in the lobby and the hotel staff are very accommodating even their porters, bell boys, guards are so very warm.",Food:Location
"This hotel is one of my favorites. I decided to treat my family for my post bday celebration and we really had so much fun. We arrived just on time for check-in and upon our arrival, we were greeted warmly by the staff and assisted us with our luggage. Check-in was breeze. The pretty preggy (whoose name I cannot recall) was very helpful and accomodating. She was very warm and friendly. The rooms given to us were on the poolside but the view was obstructed by the buildings columns and beam. But it was just okay. Our room was clean and the mattress was firm and coupled with a rainy weather, it was very relaxing and conducive for sleeping. Going to and fro the mall was easy because of the bridgeway that connects the hotel to the mall. The pool was great esp for the kids. My little one enjoyed the swim very much. Another exciting part was the Pokemon hunting. There were poke stops around the hotel and it was very thrilling to catch a number of Pokemons around the hotel. Buffet breakfast was the most enjoyable part. My family enjoyed the breakfast and we had a feast. We all went home filled with happiness because we had a great family get-away, an experience we will cherish.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Nice hotel for a staycation. It’s conveniently located near SM Megamall and The Shangri-La Mall. One can do lots of shopping and eating!!! Memories were created because of the 2-night stay in this hotel with the family. We booked three rooms. Room check-in was quite a problem as the line was long and there seem to be a problem in the booking made by the brother in law. We still had the adjoining rooms we wanted.

But the pool was a blast for the kids and their buffet breakfast was quite an experience. There was a long line on the first day and considering the family size number, it was really hard to find a group table that would seat all of us together. So we opted for the other location offered. We had a big round table. We were hungry so anything that was on their buffet table, we ate. No need to complain. Second day, line was shorter at The Head and so we were accommodated. Food here was really more organized, and the coffee was better.

Lastly, the banana walnut bread at their bakeshop is a must try! They usually run-out of it fast.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

After i ate my porridge, i stood up to get some more food, when i went back to my place i was surprise to see somebody sitting on my table! The waiter took out the rest of my food and coffee without my knowledge! What a disappointment from a 5star hotel!

"Stayed at Shangrila for 2 nites, we we're booked to the Tower wing and we opt to be transferred to the Horizon club garden wing side of the hotel since we wanted calm, quiet and silence. The tower wing showed major revamp as the garden wing is still the classic original decor. I feel that relaxation is our major objective thats's why the horizon club floor is the best one for us as we felt so relaxed during our stay.

The best front office guy, my shout out and 2 thumbs up for MIGZ, he is amazingly patient for all the request and preferences i demanded.
We arrived early and was allowed to check in early since room is already available. Since we requested a transfer migz processed all the necessary service for our stay to be as pleasant as possible. He showed us the available rooms that we may choose, from a suite to the horizon club floors. He painstakingly looked for a twin beds whilst we were having lunch and as soon as we came back to the reception, our things, our room, the ""Nespresso-maker"" request was already set up in our room.. (It is meant for suite rooms and up and we were booked on a deluxe) he also toured us to the horizon club lounge, where we can enjoy all day/nite coffee, beverages, small deserts and cocktails by 5-7pm!

My son and niece enjoyed the pool area, how amazingly secured we felt that lifeguards are seated to look after the safety of the guests.

Guestroom may be classic yet it's comfy and clean. Housekeeping always makes sure our toiletries ""l-occitane brand"" are always complete after a polished make up. Complementary water and sweets are alwez available. I wouldn't request anything that was never granted in just no waiting time at all. With ready smiles! Love love the service of this hotel. From the front office/bellman/doorgirl/housekeeping/lifeguards... They certainly made sure our stay is the best.

I didn't give it a 5 star though because the staff at the horizon club lounge are not as accommodating as the other staff. We didn't feel we were looked after everytime we come up for coffee or some drinks. Maybe cuz we're not businessman or not wearing suits, but who cares -- we are in the horizon club floor, they shouldn't discriminate if casually dress.

However, all is perfect and would definitely recommend and come stay at Shangrila again!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"With 2 kids in tow, my husband and I decided to forego our annual out of town trip to visit the beach and opted for a staycation at Edsa Shang. We were not disappointed. We stayed at one of their horizon primer suites and we were treated to a luxurious and comfortable stay. Choosing to stay in their horizon suite also entitled us to access the horizon lodge which offers snacks, drinks, wifi and meeting rooms. It was a very cozy area one could stay in if they get tired of spending time in their room. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. They sure go out of their way to make sure that each guest has a wonderful time. The snacks at the lounge was very tasty, the juices were freshly made and refreshing and the wifi was fast (relatively). The lounge even serves cocktails from 5-7pm and it offers a wide array of dishes which includes dumplings, stews and rice.

The room we occupied was very spacious, it comes with a sitting room and a balcony. I love, love, love the lóccitane toiletries they have on the room, it smells citrussy and fresh. I'm quite particular with beds and pillows and I must say, theirs were very comfortable. My only complain about the room is the almost non existent wifi and our toilet was clogged a few times. At some point I had to go to the lounge because I had to finish some work and even the wired internet was sooooo slow.

The facilities were really good, my kids enjoyed the pool in particular. They spent almost all of our entire stay by the pool area. It's so conveniently situated. We got to meet up with a lot of friends on the adjacent mall while my kids were in the pool or in the room.

All in all this was a fun stay and we've really enjoyed it. We plan to come back and do this again when we're in Manila. This hotel can be pricey but you really get great service and comfort so it's really worth it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

My family and I stayed two nights at the Edsa Shangri-La. The hotel was very comfortable and there was an abundance of security which made us feel secure. The hotel is connected to two very large shopping malls and U.S. based restaurants for the unadventurous such as myself. There is also an in-house bakery which was very convenient. My one complaint is that the only rooms available contain either two twin beds or one king bed which for a family of three adults was problematic and would have been uncomfortable if we had not upgraded to a suite.

"I was checked in at the garden wing for my first night. A later found out that the tower wing was renovated and felt relieved that I was going to stay in that wing for the rest of my trip. The garden wing needs a major revamp! The smoking floors have affected the smell of the entire wing as the smoke clings to the carpet and furniture. I personally think hotels should not have a smoking floor at all!

The breakfast buffet at Heat was pretty standard. I like their Filipino ""touches"" with the ""kakanin"" and the ""taho"" placed in a smaller version of the one's street vendors use.

The table we chose outside was wobbly but waiter Marvin quickly fixed the issue. He even gave us a bowl of fresh mangoes to make sure we have a pleasant breakfast! He was our waiter again the next day and he took care of us the whole time! He needs to be commended!

We got two adjacent rooms which the kids enjoyed. It's just a shame the other toom

Very hard to find fault with the hotel. The staff are often pleasant to a fault and very accommodating. The furnishings are typically grand as in all Shangri Las but above all else, the Internet is fast and free! No log in required and is stable. Local telcos don't offer very good speed or stability.

"The Edsa Shangrila Hotel is one of the reliable 5-star hotels in the Ortigas area for luxurious hotel pampering. Located along EDSA, between the Shangrila Plaza and the Megamall, it provides easy access to dining, shopping, movies, even medical and dental needs. The guestrooms are comfortable, with adequate amenities. The beds, pillows and blankets assure comfortable sleep. Not all the rooms have bathubs so ask for it if you want one. There is cable, wifi, and a safe for your valuables. The bathroom is well stacked, has hot water, and the towels are thick. The hotel also prides itself in its good restaurants. Buffet breakfast is provided at the Heat, where a wide selection of dishes is sure to satisfy your palates. Senju is their japanese restaurant. Try the pool; parents are assured that at least three lifeguards are watching over the kids. Their margarita by the pool bar does not quite compare with elsewhere though. There are also conference rooms for events. The staff, anywhere in the hotel, are accommodating and helpful. Check in and check out is easy and quick.

"Whenever we travel,my husband always insists on staying at a Shangdi-la property. We find that Shangri-la has the one of the best service of various hotel chains.

The highlights of our stay:
- The attentive pool staff and life guards. Always ready to lend a helping hand. A huge plus was how they ensured that only people who were wearing proper swimming attire can swim in the pool. Unlike other luxury hotel chains we have stayed at where I have seen people swim in their underwear. Gross!

- Marvin of Heat. His service is what I would call ""So Shangri-la"" the warmth and hospitality he showed was one of the best of all Shangri-las we have stayed at.

- Melissa of Heat. The Sunday breakfast where we encountered issues with the noodle station girl (more about her below), she immediately swept in to help and find a suitable solution when Ms Noodle station girl would just have a standard ""we ran out"" answer. She even ensured that the rice noodles we wanted were delivered to our table. (we didn't want noodles with gluten)

The disappointment:

- Ms Noodle station girl at breakfast. The two breakfast we had there, she was the least hospitable. And, I have to note, I am always nice and cordial when I ask or make requests. She makes no effort to please guests. She makes no effort to go the extra mile or even just ask if what the guest is looking for is still available. Day 1, I was asking if she happened to have some more fried shallots as topping for the noodles (her station toppings were always empty for some reason). Her answer (in tagalog) ""we ran out"". Lo and behold, my husband found some at the Congee station. No effort from her to check at all! Day 2, hubby and I generally don't consume gluten. So when we went to her station to get rice noodles, her answer again ""we ran out"". Just as I was going back to the table, I saw Melissa and I asked her. Melissa found rice noodles!

The people make the stay special. And the likes of Marvin and Melissa make Shangri-la a fantastic stay or a stay that is ""so shangri-la"". While ms noodle station girl doesn't add value to the Shangri-la name.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

Arrive in room to find the message light on the phone flashing - no message - kept flashing even after 3 phone calls. I eventually just unplugged the phone. The wifi reception is dire - doesn't work in the bathroom at all and is very patchy the rest of the room and hotel. Service is awful - waited nearly an hour for a bowl of pasta in the main HEAT restaurant (which was full, but very noisy, crowded and overpriced). My room is freezing - first thing I did on arrival was to turn off the air conditioning but the room is still cold - the technician came to look at it but seems to think that 22 degrees is normal and I'm the odd one for wanting it warmer than that .. since it's 30 outside SOMETHING is keeping it cold in my room! Would be nice if they would let me turn it off. So then customer service rings up to find out if the technician has fixed my problem - so I point out that no, he hasn't and I mention some of the other things that are not working well. I finish the conversation with ""but I'm tired and going to bed now so please don't call me again""... and what do they do? 15 minutes later.. another phone call ""please hold for the duty manager"".... then a bunch of hold music followed by ""oh sorry the line disconnected"".

"I stayed at Edsa for a week in the month of July. Initially people said the facilities and rooms of Edsa are nothing compared to the Makati Shangrila. However while I havent been to the Makati one I was no way disappointed by Edsa. The rooms were great and very comfortable. The breakfast and generally the food was amazing but the highlight for me was their wellness centre. It was one of the best I have been too across the various 5 star hotels I have stayed in. The gym is very well equipped with great trainers. I went for person training sessions often and group glasses which was a lot of fun. The sauna, steam and jacuzi were top notch and really complemented an intensive workout. Great place overall with very friendly staff. Highly recommend.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I was disappointed by this hotel as a whole during my last visit. Throughout my week-long stay, the service did not reflect the expectations for a five star rated hotel. Apart from check-in, which was quite quick and was done in-room, nothing at the hotel was fast or efficient, most notably with food and drink service. The lobby lounge coffee/tea/wine service is painfully slow. There were also very long lines at the front desk and concierge any time I needed to use those services.

In attempting to get directions to a meeting in the immediate area, I was given incorrect information by the concierge and the staff posted outside at the door. They were wrong about the location of the building where I was headed, in addition to underestimating how long it would take to get there once they figured out where it was.

Local transport from the hotel is also very difficult. Taxis are generally not prevalent, requiring you to book from the rental car facility on site. This is comparatively more expensive and during my stay frequently ran out of cars, which caused a good deal of inconvenience.

Finally, when checking out I was presented with a bill that was incorrect. As I was working with the staff to figure out the details (which ended up costing me more in the end), the couple checking out next to me were also in a heated discussion with the staff about an incorrect bill. I'm not sure if this was a particularly bad day at the front desk, but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth for the long ride to the airport.",Staff

"A Welcome respite in the heart of commercial/business district is this hotel which is just a stones throw away from MegaMall, or a par-5ish distance from the Philippine Stock Exchange housed in the Tektite Towers, schools and other business establishments. Within this chaotic urban environment is this big welcoming hotel whose amenities can seemingly take you thousand of miles away even for just a day or two. The Heat is their 5-star restaurant and the Chi is their 5-star spa. Housed at the 2nd floor are equally authentic japanese Senju Restaurant served by kimono-clad servers. Not to miss is their big and well maintained pool. The Edsa Shangrila Mall is just adjacent to this hotel and can be accessed by foot via a private path of elevator and escalator that takes you to the 5th floor, or simply cross the next building to the newly built luxury depot of One Shangrila. Service and security is of utmost importance to protect their clients. You don't see them 'cause they are in plain clothes but they are there for just that. On weekends you will be entertained by free concerts, fashion shows or art gallery shows at the mall lobby or at the 2nd floor.",Comfort & Facilities:Location

"On a recent trip to the Philippines we stayed at the lovely Shangri-La Hotel (on Edsa).
To say that this is a first class property would be a gross understatement. You are first impressed by the high levels of security upon entering the grounds. Before you can even get to the front doors the car is subject to search and a sniffing dog ensures that there are no explosive devices in the car. Then your luggage is scanned just like at the airport. Finally, each hand carried purse or bag is inspected before you can enter the hotel. While this may be a modern day necessity it also provides a high degree of comfort for patrons.

Upon entering the hotel you are immediately impressed with the grandeur of the lobby and bar, which features beautifully polished marble walls and tile floors which were impeccably clean.

The lobby features a lovely bar with floor to ceiling windows soaring to over 20 feet and looking out to lighted fountains and lovely palm trees. There is also a bakery which features pastries baked on the premises. Before entering the bar/lounge there is a beautiful glass sculpture with dozens of orchids inserted into small vials with water.

The rooms are well done with modern furnishings and lovely city views. The bathroom is beautifully appointed with a walk in shower and other amenities you would expect in a five star hotel.

The service was outstanding with the possible exception of a somewhat slow front desk (making check in and check out very slow). This could be improved by adding one or two people. Otherwise, the service was excellent.

Additional amenities include a fabulous fitness center, several high end retail shops (especially jewelry) and plenty of meeting space. There is also a beautiful pool and a spa.

The rates are reasonable and the experience was excellent. We definitely plan to stay there again when we return in December. Outstanding property !!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We had to got to the city for some business and decided to have some fun after and stay at Edsa Shang for the evening.

Check-in was quick and easy but we had to look for the elevator to our room for a few minutes because it was in another wing.

The room was clean and spacious. The bathroom was okay. A few strands of hair on the tub but generally clean otherwise. Wifi wasexcellent.

Staff were very polite and welcoming. Especially the guy who did housekeeping on our floor. He greeted us with a sincere smile everytime he saw us.

We also had breakfast and the quality and selection was excellent. The only disappointment we had was my wife did not get to taste the palitaw which ran out about an hour before breakfast service ended but was not refilled. She asked about it and was told that they won't be making more. She was wanting to eat it for weeks and was quite surprised to see the plateful on the buffet table but her mistake was not getting some immediately.

Shang Mall and SM Megamall are both a few minutes walk away, Shang Mall is a bit more convenient because you don't have to go out the streets as its connected to the hotel by a walkway.

"My first stay in Manila and choose a fantastic hotel. Next to shopping malls (which is ideal considering the horrendous traffic of manila), Getting here from the airport took close to 1.5 hours at midday (though by distance it seems pretty short). Check in was straight forward.

Standard ""uncle"" looking room but has all the basic amenities of what you would expect in a Shangri-La. Coffee making facilities, in room safe, polishing service for shoes, iron and board. Beds are comfortable.

Huge pool, though it can be really crowded on weekends. Barely any space compared to weekdays. Since my conference event was in the hotel, it was certainly very convenient and I didn't have to go anywhere else.

The breakfast selection is certain something to shout about. A good range of local and international cuisines, is certainly a must try when you stay at Shang hotels around the world.

"Unfortunately we expected a lot from this hotel only to be deceived the moment we made our check in. The king size bed we requested was not available on the location we preferred and we had to wait 10 minutes just to hear about this news. The front desk said we have "" 2 options"", a king size bed on the wing where they were doing renovations and will be noisy for the whole day, or another floor peaceful but with twin size beds. Where was the option there? We complained that we specifically indicated a king size bed and that's what should be given to us but the front desk answered with conviction that the option is not a guarantee ( why offer the option?). The room was ok big with a comfortable bed, the shower has very good pressure. One night we arrived late and we were thirsty only to find out that our room did not have a mini bar. We ordered for water and we had to call 2 times just to have our water delivered in our room. Seriously, you pay for a premium price and I believe we deserve the comforts or the mini bar. Upon check out it was the same front desk clerk and she asked us about our stay. We were honest and told exactly what we felt and that was it. No service recovery, she said someone will email and all these words but no follow up afterwards. We are not people with high standards but we can clearly say that the experience with this hotel is not pleasant and is not worth the price at all.

Connected to the big Shangri-La plaza with loads of restaurants and shops, and it feels like a different world as soon as you set foot onto the main street and nearby neighbourhood - from a 5-star hotel to extremely local markets, and very heavy traffic with buses honking all the way...

"They say ""you can't go home again"", but my second stay at the EDSA Shang was just as great as the first. I was there in November-December for 2 weeks (see my review December 4th, 2015) and I recently returned from another stay for 10 days in June 2016. I like everything about this hotel. The room is fantastic - really comfortable bed, the best showerhead you've ever had in your life, good free Wi-Fi and powerful air conditioning. Let me just talk about this bathroom for a bit more. All marble- super nice and if you turn on that rainshower head, it's like Flashdance. Obviously no care about water conservation and I loved it! And they seem to have enhanced the toilet with one of those butt washers since my last stay. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did.
The staff was just as friendly as ever, and two of them even said ""welcome back"" when they saw me. You really can't fault the service at all.
The gym remains by far the best hotel gym I have ever seen. It's actually nicer than my gym back home! So much new equipment (they really have everything you could need) and friendly staff. My trainer emailed me workouts and they had every tool I needed to try those workouts- and he's pretty inventive! Try alternating between the hot tub and cold plunge pool after your workout for complete relaxation.
But the real gem of this hotel is the pool. Even better this visit because all the trees were in bloom. So beautiful. A calm oasis in a noisy and dirty city. One drawback this time was it was the week before school went back in the Philippines so there were a ton of Philippine families in the pool so not as calm and relaxing sometimes. This hotel is very popular with the locals. But still there were times (especially early morning) when there would only be 2 of us in the pool area. And full strong Wi-Fi around the pool lets you video chat with your friends back home and make them jealous!
I had a massage at the Chi spa included with my room this time around, and it was...interesting. Let's just say Filipinos seems to have different standards around privacy and what is off limits than we do in Canada. But left feeling quite relaxed afterwards.
Took more time to explore the amazing Shangri-La Plaza (mall) next door this time. Didn't realize how extensive that was. Lots of high end shops but also a cheap food court in the basement.
This time around I had a tour of the garden rooms so I'd know what they're like for my next booking and no thank you, I'll stick with the tower rooms and I suggest you do too.

These are basic things that needs to be checked before keys are handed over to the guests.
The concierge is not helpful and engaging.
I made booking directly thru the reservation team and provided the ages of the kids to ensure seamless stay and basic cost are included in the quotation. however I was informed during breakfast that one kid is not covered and asked me to sign a receipt as to include as additional charge.

"Of course you will need to choose a hotel near the place of business or visit to avoid hours of traffic. If you need to be close to the Edsa the choice is easy. The Shangri-La is a great business and family hotel that caters both to the business and casual travelers. For business travelers choose the Horizon Club, because it includes the Club Lounge, where you can get service 24 h and breakfast and ""happy hour"" food and drink for free.
The breakfast is the best I have seen in any hotel in the world. It is large and often you are overwhelmed, but you can pick the right stuff for you. The comment I saw about it being like a factory is just not true, it just has a lot of choice.
The mega malls next door are nice to have but only if you need to go shopping.
The better perk is the nice and big pool, which makes you forget that you are in the middle of the city.
Staff is very friendly and I must especially mention the staff in the club lounge. They make you feel welcome and are always ready to help.

"i notice that many of the good reviews for this hotel are from those who choose the edsa shang for a “staycation.” i wonder if they’d feel the same way about this property if they stayed for extended periods. i visit manila on business quite frequently and choose the edsa shang because of its location; it’s close to many of the places i need to be for business. and with traffic the way it is in manila, that’s important! i spent close to thirty nights at the edsa shang in 2014 and did more than 70 last year. so, i’ve seen the good, the bad and - increasingly - the ugly.

there’s a lot of good… there is much to recommend at this property, but its chief flaw is that it’s incredibly inconsistent. from the rooms, to the restaurants, to room service, to the staff… the hallmark of the edsa shangri-la is its inconsistency..

order a medium well burger from room service - at a hefty 950 pesos - and it will be cooked perfectly one night. the next night it’s burnt to a crisp. one night it will arrive with three bottles of ketchup, two bottles of mayonnaise and a bottle of mustard. the next night, no ketchup, and no mayo… just mustard. and the time after that, it’ll arrive with a mysterious dollop of sweet pickle relish, an ingredient not mentioned on the menu.

ask for onion in your salad, and you’ll get one tiny sliver of onion one night, the next night, you’ll get a separate plate with half an onion. ask for thousand island dressing and you’ll get a pre-dressed salad with sone sort of pesto vinaigrette, as well as the dressing you actually requested. (sometimes it’s in a ramekin, sometimes it’s in a gravy boat!)

ask for a glass of ice water and you’re as likely to get two as none… and sometimes you’ll get an entire pitcher of cold water and two empty glasses (no ice). one night, the “butter chicken” will feature a large portion of tasty tender morsels of boneless chicken breast, the next night it’ll be small pieces of chicken on the bone… and barely two ounces of edible meat.

dine at “heat,"" their buffet restaurant, and you’ll receive attentive service by skilled hospitality professionals, except if you’re seated in the wrong section. the thing is, you never know where that section is going to be. not only do they rotate the staff, but some days you'll walk in there and the entire waitstaff has been replaced. I've never been able to figure this out... where do they go? they are not - apparently - being moved to other jobs at the same hotel... what restaurateur gets rid of his entire staff overnight? completely baffling! the point is that you can have outstanding service here, but you’re just as likely not to get your coffee or water glass refilled or have your plates cleared. the same could be said of many other hotels in manila, i suppose, but right now we’re talking about this one… the edsa shagri-la... and the thing is this: they’re capable of top notch service… they just seem incapable of delivering it consistently.

the one shining star at the breakfast buffet, and he’s been mentioned in other reviews, is chef rico. he’ll cook eggs for you once and remember EXACTLY the way you like them… not just tomorrow, but when you return three months later. he’s an extraordinary asset to this hotel and he should in fact be running the entire property. here’s a man who understands customer service and consistency!

the food at “heat” is also hit or miss… some days, everything is delicious, other days you have to forage to make a proper meal. one would think that would be easy… the problem is they change the damn location of everything almost every day. somewhere, in the bowels of the shang, there is a food and beverage manager who likes to tinker. i imagine his brainstorming meetings go something like this:

""the salad is no good over here, let’s move it twelve feet away, just to shake things up. it makes no sense to have the onions and cucumbers near the lettuce… let’s put the dry cereal near the lettuce and move the onions and cucumbers and tomatoes over to the indian food station. and then, let’s change the location of many items nearly every day, so people have a hard time finding their favorite foods. but that meatloaf… we got a lot of it… and even though nobody eats it… let’s serve it every single day. hey, here’s another swell idea… let’s slice the cucumbers in long spears and give people a teaspoon and see if they can lift the cucumbers and put it on their plates… with just a spoon. that’ll be fun to watch! lets hide all the tongs. and why not stuff all the onions in a tiny crock with a small open mouth and see if people can get the onions out with that same teaspoon? that’ll be hilarious! and the bacon... let’s put it under a low hanging heat lamp and cook it so that fourteen pieces stick together and you can’t separate them because you can’t maneuver around the heat lamp. let’s have one of our chefs squeeze a loud taxi horn in the middle of the breakfast rush for no apparent reason… people love loud nosies when they first wake up! and let’s not staff the ice cream and yogurt station…if we keep them waiting for the ice cream, they’ll appreciate it that much more. and let's keep the serving bowls for the ice cream near the guests and not by the freezer… that way, when the ice cream guy finally shows up, he’ll have to have an extra special guest interaction and ask the guest to hand over a bowl. it’ll be like performance art! and let’s wait to run out of everything before we cook more…. i mean, what if people don’t eat any bacon at breakfast? we wouldn’t want to cook extra! let’s wait till we run out to make sure we need some. same thing with the thousand island dressing… it’s clearly our most popular dressing… we always run out. what would happen if we don’t refill it for twenty or thirty minutes… or ever at all? would people notice?”

in fact, i’m here to tell you that we do notice… we even ask for it to be replenished. we ask for all these things to be replenished. sadly, they rarely are. and whatever you do, don’t dine in the last 90 minutes before closing… while they neglect refilling buffet items during normal operating hours, it gets much worse the closer you get to closing time. it’s downright shameful, especially at the dinner buffet. you’ll walk away hungry… and broke. the bufftet is close to US $40.

on the weekends, the place is pure madness. the shang must have an aggressive discount for locals who wish to spend the weekend, as the place is filled with families and the aforementioned kids running around everywhere, including the pool. what this means is long lines to enter the buffet and chaos once inside. they do open up an “extension” breakfast in a restaurant on the second floor, but few people take advantage of that. (on a side note, what’s disappointing is that the hotel doesn’t offer long staying guests a blended rate that takes into account the significant discount available to others on the weekends.)

“heat” has a lot of people walking around and repeatedly wishing you “good morning” during breakfast. that’s all well and good, but they don’t seem to remember you… so the same person wishes you ""good morning” three or four times. if they took half those people and had them pay attention to how the buffet line is set up, which serving utensils are available and which items run out frequently, this would be one hell of a fine restaurant. as it’s run now, it’s tolerable for breakfast, if breakfast is included in your room rate. if it’s not, don’t bother… you’re in for one hell of an expensive disappointment.

the main thing you can rely on at a fine hotel is a good night’s sleep.

not here!

children run through the hallways at all hours and the housekeepers and room service waiters are also trained to relentlessly recite “good morning” or “good afternoon” each time anyone passes…in booming voices, regardless of whether it’s 8:30 AM or 2:30 AM… don’t they realize that people are sleeping just a few feet away?

most troubling, though, is that the hotel frequently has plumbing emergencies, which seem to require loud banging… for hours on end. the hotel is fond of doing loud renovation and repair work to rooms during the day on otherwise occupied floors. this is despite the fact that a large part of their clientele are business people who work overnight and sleep during the day.

most showers at the shang have clogged drains which means you’re almost always taking a shower in standing water. take a long shower and the water can actually overflow into the bathroom. related to this problem is that many of the shower doors do not have good seals, so it’s quite common for your bathroom to be flooded anyway. don’t they do routine maintenance checks at this hotel? doesn’t the housekeeping staff see the bathroom floor is flooded every day and report it? how is it that room after room has the same problems? (clogged drains, poor tv reception, inadequate wifi… the list goes on!) how is it that room after room has shower doors that were installed improperly… with the door opening IN to the shower stall?

the rooms are good and nicely decorated, but finding a room in which everything works will be challenging.

as for their frequent guest program, it’s an almost complete and total bust. earning potential is low and redemption values are extremely high for preferred properties. i’ve been staying at this and other shangs for three years and still don’t have enough points for one night at the shard in london. and even as a diamond member, i’ve never been given an upgrade on paid stays. most of the problems with the frequent guest program are corporate problems due to a poorly designed program… and to be fair, it’s a young program, just five years old… but, here, too, inconsistency abounds. i have three colleagues, all of whom have also achieved diamond status as well… one of us received lovely pens as a gift… the other three did not. two of us received complimentary leather luggage tags, two of us did not.

wildly inconsistent!

the shang needs to study some its american competitors to learn about consistency, how to engender brand loyalty and how to reward its most frequent guests.",Food:Staff:Value for money

My family and I stayed at Edsa Shangri-la overnight and I made my reservation over the phone. When we arrived we were able to check in early but I still need to follow up with housekeeping for our request to prepare the sofa bed (it was requested prior to arrival. Room was a bit outdated (garden wing) and i was disappointed to see the room. Tv was not HD and you can see that it was not cleaned well because of the dust at the lamp shade. We had a breakfast at the heat and that really disappoints me because most of the food served is cold and not appetizing. My mother ordered ala carte and it was really expensive and it arrived more than 30 mins. After checking out i found out that there was an unauthorized charge on my credit card that I was not aware of. I called them 3x and i was put on hold for 20 mins. Staff are not trained well to handle customer concern and it was really disappointing for a 5 star hotel. I found out that I was charge for the room and the security deposit but ofcourse I should be informed first. I was handled poorly and it really made me feel bad to have stayed in that hotel.,Staff:Value for money:Cleanliness

"Had such a lovely time with my immediate and extended family. We booked rooms here and we really had fun. Without a doubt, Shang still remains as one of the best hotels in Manila.

There were also many families who stayed at the hotel during our stay since it was Christmas and even if there were many people, the place remained lovely. Still classy, clean, beautiful to look at and we still enjoyed walking around. We had to line up and wait before checking in but the front desk officers and representatives were very organized and accommodating. They even had gifts for the kids so my baby cousin got his. Excellent service! I believe we raped the room service button. Hahaha! Celebrating with the family here was worth it.

Swimming pool was ok. There were a play area for kids near to the swimming pool. Hotel is near to shangri la shopping mall. U can go for few drinks on their nearby bar (recommended Brotzeit bar if you are a german beer lover).

Front desk staff was very very approachable and friendly. Check in and check out was within mins.

"Good facilities. Room is perfect.

However, if you are coming during peak season, the long line at the breakfast buffet will ruin your day. Don't bother listening to their rationale. They will redirect you to another restaurant but that too will have a very long waiting time.

As for the lobby lounge, the staff ruin the ambience with their stoic expression. Not sure whether they are tired of their shift or they don't like what they are doing. Regardless, they should know by now that the nature of their job is to properly interact with people. The rest of the hotel staff are doing a 5-star job and the lobby lounge staff should not water the quality down.

Key is to not raise your expectations. Pay 5-star for the facilities but don't expect anything with the restaurant and lobby lounge staff.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I've spent 6 weeks of 2016 at the Shang so far. It is a very nice location. Centrally located near several businesses, it makes commuting for work easy. Two malls/grocery stores are within a 5 minute walk as well. The restaurants are nice, and the lobby will make food 24 hours a day. Service in the lobby is slow, but they have improved the speed and attention over earlier trips. Hotel staff are courteous, if not a bit overly aggressive to help (seriously, housekeeping stops three times a day to check if they can clean the room. I think a little space is warranted) but all told, it is a great place to stay. I'm sure I will be back to Manila this year, and I will be at the Shang when I return.",Location:Staff:Food

"I booked an overnight stay triple sharing rom at Edsa Shangrila hotel last Saturday, the hotel provided me a two twin bed. However, the bed looks like small for triple adult sharing. So I inquired for an extra roll out bed which will cost me Php 2000+. So I decided not to get one because its too pricey. We went out for a dinner then when we came back, there is an extra roll-out bed provided to us. I called the front desk to tell that I did not request for an extra bed but decided not pull it out and instead pay for it so that the staff will no longer have a hard time to pull it out. Then the phone rang and the front desk officer that it is a complimentary since I was booked for triple sharing. Its really a big relief for me.

My question now is, extra bed is really a complimentary for triple sharing? Or maybe they noticed me that I am not that sure if I'm going to get the extra bed or not because of the price.

We had our complimentary breakfast at Heat, we woke up early since we knew that there are too many guests checked-in that week. The food are consirtently delicious but I have noticed that some cuisine are not served such as shanghai, friedrice and cheese. Other than that, the quality of service are excellent. They even give a complimentary chocolates for mother's day celebration.

Last comment is, maybe the hotel can adjust the chlorine in pool. I accidentally tasted it and its too salty (ewww).

The dining area (heat )is not full pack however they charge kids 6 yrs old below without asking if she wanted to eat their course .. Why hotels have different policy regarding kids age ( the hotel group should have same policy in dining area privilege for kids , different hotel with different policies). They should provide cold chocolate drinks , candies or cookies for kids if they were going to bill their client since 5 yrs old kids will not eat those kind of menu..Im just thankful for the server who extend her help looking for coco crunch n able to serve pancake for my kid... 5.

A 24 hours lobby bar area makes you knowing you will get what you need at any time (although the last day i asked for a sandwich before I left, at 3 am, but they told me it will take 20 min for having ready one simple sandwich!), some stores (including the bakery of the delicious banana bread) and access closely to the Sangri La mall, the spa, a nice pool, many salons for events and all surrounded by constant and attentive security and smiling people working everywhere makes the hotel really a good one.

You wont be able to see the front desk immediately as it is located on the right side of the lobby. it was busy when I checked-in but they handled it well. Thumbs up!

Dishes at Heat are excellent and mouthwatering however I was quite disappointed with the service. It was very slow and there were no enough staff I guess. Senju was exquisite. They really serve authentic Japanese food. I didn't get a chance to try Chi Spa as it was a short trip. I found the hotel a bit far from the airport or maybe it's because of the traffic jam.

- we arrived late and i expected to check in promptly upon arrival, but we were made to wait for almost an hour because room is not yet ready.. we were tired but had no choice.. we were escorted to the executive lounge to wait, but the wait took around 45 minutes and its just too much considering i booked my reservation weeks in advance and they should have not allowed late check outs by guest knowing they have an incoming guest checking in
- walking along carpeted corridor leading to the executive lounge, my daughter noted smell of a dated hotel.. not so welcoming at all

positives
they graciously allowed me late check out
they gave a mini birthday cake to celebrate my son's birthday which is sweet
room (executive suite) is modern and spacious with nice L Occitane toiletries
food variety in the executive lounge is good especially during breakfast and cocktails, not so much for high tea time but it was still okay
good swimming pool
staff is friendly and professional
over all it was a nice stay.. would still consider going back

"I was I Manila on a 3 week business trip. The Edsa Shangri-la is a very grand hotel with exceptional customer service. As I had to work at night and sleep during the day, the hotel accommodated nighttime room cleaning and no disturbance during the day. The pool and garden was an island of tranquility in a very busy city.

The food was very good with my favorite being the Paparazzi Italian restaurant for dinner (or breakfast as my days started at 7:00 p.m.). Every morning, after returning to the hotel after a long work night, Heat offered a wonderful breakfast buffet. And the lobby lounge is open 24/7 and gracious service was received from Jonathan and Maleel. The Bakery Shop offers fresh Bakery daily and will cure any sweet tooth.

Bottled water is replenished daily in your room, however I craved ice cold water and used the mini bar fridge to cool my water bottles.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Business trip so had little time in the hotel.
Breakfast is amazing with a very wide range of foods . The egg stand is great.
My room was lovely .

The pool area was great and staff there were fantastic. .",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We really like the place and it is worth the expense when staying in Manila for a few days.
The rooms are great and everything is taken care of in detail. The pool is fabulous and if you are on holiday a great place to relax at all times.
The breakfast is a decadent but delicious affair and contains so much different preparations of various countries that it could be lunch or dinner!
The staff is very helpful at all times and extremely courteous.
We had a special deal where the airport transfers were included and we had possibility of a late check-out (18:00 hours!) which was very convenient due to our late scheduled flight. We were met at the airport by Shangri-la staff and driven to the hotel in a nice limousine: fabulous.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Shangri-la defined: ""an idyllic hideaway"". Unfortunately, our experience was certainly NOT idyllic!!

Our first night, we endured noise from below so loud that the exterior windows were literally vibrating. A call to the front desk revealed that there was an ""event"" at the hotel, and that would ""only"" be until 11 p.m. Really??????? On a Monday night?? We were told we could change our room, as the ""event"" would be on-going the next three nights.

So changed rooms the next morning. Lui indicated that our former room would not be occupied, as the hotel would not want other guests to endure what we did. Well, guess what?? Yep! It was rented out Tuesday night ironically to a group even LOUDER than the window-vibrating sounds. A giant group was in our former room -- doors slamming, loud noises,screaming voices, the works -- from 12:40 - 1:20 a.m. Security attempted to shut it down, as we heard the girls saying, ""Sorry, sorry, sorry,"" but the moment security left, they were back at it, singing ""Happy Birthday"", doors slamming, loud hallway noises, etc., etc. Hey security -- try sticking around and see if the guests actually care enough to stop their obnoxious behavior. Or is that the clientele this hotel invites???????

As if THAT wasn't enough, the pool is utilized at least TWO afternoons a week by Aqualogics -- for SWIM LESSONS!!!!! They put in a pool lane, ostensibly so that Aqualogics stays within that boundary. Do they??? Of course they don't. The pool is positively TAKEN OVER by kids (except for the 9-feet deep section, in fairness) I guess I can see the hotel trying to profit from an underutilized resource, but c'mon -- not at the expense of the paying guests!!!!! Does management SEE the potato chip bags from parents flying into the pool water? Does management SEE the women's restroom after about ten little ones (at least!) use the facilities and the rank results? Ugh!!!!

So.....Shangri-la?? I think not...!!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff

The bars and restaurants are pretty good but it could do with one or two more bars other than the main one in the reception area.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I was there for one night for a conference. Stayed on the 13th floor in the Tower Wing. The room was large and the bed was comfortable. It was a nice howbeit typical room for a reasonably upscale hotel. The common areas in the hotel were clean, well maintained and comfortable. Food at the HEAT was very good. A wide variety of choices. Buffet was $63.50/person (no alcohol). The pool area was packed with kids with little hiding place for adults. Great for families. The staff at every level were extraordinarily friendly and helpful. I stayed at the Makati Shangrila in Manila a few years ago and it was a more impressive location.

The Tower Wing is just above the main lobby and HEAT restaurant. The Garden Wing is a short walk from the lobby and has their VIP lounge in it. Both have easy access to the pool.

Overall, it was a pleasant, comfortable stay. I would go back but I might check other options first.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
The hotel first impressions are good with high level of security protecting the premises. The room was very clean with amazing bedding and comfortable mattress. It has tea/coffee making which is a good perk. Had breakfast in HEAT and all went well with sufficient choice to cater for all preferences and tastes. Had the Wagyu beef burger in lobby bar and was entertained by great singer performing. Pool was good and pool bar food perfect way to relax after business. I would look to pay extra next time to get higher floor in tower. Check out was easy and all staff very accommodating and polite to guests. I highly recommend staying here.,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Cleanliness
"1) Location very inconvenient for business as it takes a long time to get from the hotel to Makati and other business areas. In addition it takes ages until a public taxi is organised by the concierges.
2) Food at Heat restaurant offers a buffet with a variety of choices. Basically a good thing, however it's not really tasty whatever you try (Sushi/Salads/Seafood or cooked dishes)
3) Pool is similar as with other Shangri-La hotels, means good. Gym is very good with plenty of machines and exercise options. Very friendly staff.
4) Finally, what annoyed my are the skills of the front desk staff. It took them roughly 15-20 minutes during both, check-in and check-out.",Food:Staff:Location

And when we finally got our turn, THE ROOMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ?! Hello?
And the manager was just standing there doing nothing. If I didnt complain, she would not even move to facilitate the long lines!.

We requested a 12 noon check in and we were told that it was noted already. But the official check in time is 2pm. We got stuck in shopping and arrive at 2pm. We waited in line for 40mins so,its almost 3pm when the guy at the reception said Room is not yet available?

"It was my niece's prom night and my sister in law invited me to have a bonding time with them. Our room was clean and spacious and so was the bathroom. I was relieved that the beds were designed facing the tv instead of the standard wall size mirror. We also had a great view of pool side.
While the young ones attended to their event, I spent my time to relaxing at their spa. Love the jacuzzi, there were two kinds the hot and the cold. The shower was also awesome, the shower head was placed so high it felt like taking a shower in the rain. Shampoo and liquid soaps were provided. I had some good quality quiet time before other hotel patrons started coming in.
The next day, we had buffet brekkie. The place was packed but still we were given a good spot. It was a fusion of Filipino, American, Chinese spread. From cereals to desserts, I ended up tasting a little bit of everything. My favorite though was surprisingly their signature green smoothie. I actually had two, the second being my dessert because it was really good. It was hard to get good service at the buffet though, waiters were bustling around. Our coffee came late and our milk, I gave up waiting and got milk from the cereal area instead. Can't blame them though, people just kept coming in.
Overall, our stay in Shangrila Edsa was good. My only regret was not swimming at the pool, it was sooo inviting even at night.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"After a full 2-weeks of overtime work, we decided for a quick weekend stay at Edsa Shangri-la to recharge. My colleague's husband from Dubai is also arriving for his annual leave and what a better way to start his vacation than an overnight stay with his family. So we booked 3 rooms, 2 from my collegaue and her hubby, Room #2 for their son and nephew and Room #3 for me and my roommate. ESL Reservations Dave and Jello villegas were both helpful and conversant with the hotel offerings. We quickly got our e-mailed reservations and off to a relaxing weekend. Check-in was a breeze with Catherine as in-charge and also Charlene and Jim who helped my roommate with her keys (she came in after me due to some personal errands). My colleague Wena was pleasantly surprised overt he resort vibe of the pool and remarked she didn't feel like in the Mandaluyong city proper. her son and nephew immensely enjoyed the pool that they swam after checking in and on Sunday morning too. Our late lunch at Heat was totally enjoyable thanks to the thoughtful service by Pinky, Ian, Mike, Paul and Chevy. The roast pork belly and beef adobo by Chef Lino and Chef April highlighted said lunch and is worth the 2nd & 3rd servings. (I forgot the name of the tall chinky-eyed chef in the dimsum station who recommended the steamed pork and shrimp siomai offerings which we happily partook of ) Chef Wilbert thoughtfully offered the lemon sorbet to counter the richness of the meat dishes. After hearing the Saturday mass and some shopping at the nearby Shangri-la Mall, we decided for a late dinner again at Heat where we got the rock-star treatment from Glaiza, Ronnel, Lawrence, Capt. Mike and Capt. George. Chef Freddie also worked his magic on our Kway teow noodles and Beef Noodle orders. Thanks also to Arcie, Chef Icko, Darwin and Capt. Noel for the lovely nightcap, a fitting way to lull us to sleep. Mid-morning breakfast started on a good note through the great seats with a relaxing view of the pool thanks to Charlene and Mayra. My roommate looked forward to the sumptuous breakfast offering with Paul and Cecille ably attending to our table. Bernie thoughtfully served our favorite tomato and green machine juices for our Vitamin C fix, a healthier way to jumpstart our Sunday. it was a very filling breakfast, and on a personal note, the best hotel breakfast buffet among all Manila hotels.

They proved for themselves the relaxing atmosphere of Edsa Shangri-La's ambience like a resort in the city.

"THE BAD
Vallet parking - I brought my car to basement 2 on Thursday night as they said they have a lot of guests so no one from their attendees can take it there. As I arrived in basement 2, no one is guiding me where to go or where to park until I saw 2 vallet parking attendants smilling at each other and chatting. I have to open my window and ask where to park before they point me to a place where they can take it later.

Upon checking out, I was advised that it takes a while to get my vehicle as there are many guests. I understand that and have prepared myself to wait up to an hour but not for TWO hours. I gave my parking ticket to the vallet attendance 15 minutes ahead of my brother but his car came in 15 minutes earlier than mine. We parked at the same time on Thursday night so I do not know why his car came in earlier than mine.

Vallet parking has no system. There are 3 lanes in front of the hotel and the outer lanes (1st and 3rd) are being utilized for dropping off and picking up guests. Guests are using both lanes to leave their cars for vallet parking causing traffic jam to entering vehicles. Their security personnel can't even tell the drivers waiting for their passengers to get out of the outer lanes as they are causing traffic jam.

Hotel lobby seats - We are waiting at the lobby for our car (from the vallet parking) and there was no hotel staff to attend to us to offer seats or even a glass of water to checking out guests. Hotel staff should have appeased the displeased checking out guests due to the inefficiency of their vallet parking system. My son sat down at one of the chairs in the lobby bar and was asked by the staff to go back to his parents. He sat there as we have been standing for more than an hour waiting for our car. My wife saw the staff talking to people who sat down on those chairs and pointing them to another location to sit.

Welcome experience - No hotel staff pressence at the lobby - there were no hotel staff present at the lobby to welcome guests or point to which place they should go. The lady at the elevator said ""Parang palengke sa lobby (It is like a market place at the lobby).""

Breakfast - the hotel has lots of guests so HEAT can't take us all (15 - 5 adults, 9 kids). They told us to go the E's bar as they have larger tables there and food is the same. Outside E's bar is a tent setup for dinning purposes. It is like an events place where wedding reception takes place.

The food - Bacon is hard and not crispy, like over fried. Chicken noodle soup stock doesn't taste good and is quite cold. The lady chef who is preparing omelet doesn't have the right tools to perform her job. Her frying pan has a broken handle and she told it to another chef (a more senior one I think) but he said ""Pwede na yan"" (That will do). She uses a spatula for turning over crepes to turn over the egg as she can't toss it due to the pan's broken handle. As a result, her omelet looks like scrambled eggs.
The tent seems to be understaffed as well as not having enough waiters around to attend to all the guests.
The chicken tocino doesn't look cooked at all. My son complained that the tocino doesn't look like a tocino. He loves tocino by the way.

THE GOOD SIDE
Pool design is nice as there is a kids place they could play around.
Pool is also large but the 9ft area somehow limited the space as not all people can enjoy that deep water.

Hotel room - good design, modern, very well lit although the cove lighting on my tv-side is not working and the night light at the left is not working too. The banana slice is a good thing too but among the 4 rooms we booked, we are the only ones who has it. Rest room has good design as well.

The hotel is design is modern and is very well lit.

Check out - they use tablet (Cintiq) to be signed by checking out guests. It was very nice as it is a good innovation. Not even Marriot in Mexico has this one.

I am not promoting any hotel at all but I didn't experience this with Sofitel last year. I stayed there from Maundy Thursdy to Black Saturday and they can handle their guests very well even if they are fully booked.

Checking in wasn't a problem. The venue for my cousin's wedding was great and food was fantastic. My family had a great time celebrating and at the same time boding during this special event. Breakfast buffet would be my favourite part of the day. Room service was good and the staff were friendly.,Staff:Food
"From the check-in to check-out, the service was absolutely brilliant. We got upgraded to a room in the main wing which was beautiful with a pool view. We have been here many times, and the overall ambience is excellent.

The breakfast buffet at HEAT was great with a decent variety. Service was spot-on, with no major hiccups. The pool is a great place to relax as well; it was clean, well tended to and perfect for a lazy morning of reading by the poolside.

Another big advantage of staying here is the super close proximity of the hotel to Shoemart Edsa and Shangri-la's very own Edsa Shangri-la Plaza. You will be spoilt for choice with regards to shopping and eating, as both of these malls are only a five minute walk away.

Overall, loved every bit of it and we are excited to go back again soon.

Just an extra tip: Edsa Plaza can be accessed by a bridge between Edsa Shangrila and the Plaza. There is no need to walk out on the main street.",Location:Food
"I recently stayed at the Edsa on a three day stop in Manila on my way to Boracay. It is a little far from the airport but if you are looking for a hotel in this area of town I highly recommend it.

Because I was traveling alone and was unfamiliar with Manila I utilized their car service (2995 PHP) as transportation to the hotel. There is someone waiting with a sign for the hotel and you are quickly moved through the craziness of the airport into a comfortable sedan.

As soon as I arrived I was greeted by a staff member who took me directly to my room to and finalized my check in there. This was a lovely perk as I was tired from my travels and was ready to relax.

If you enjoy breakfast their buffet is not to be missed. My waiter was kind enough to bring me my third helping of fresh mangos since he saw how much I loved them.

Since I would be on holiday for several weeks I thought a treat to the spa was in order. The spa facilities were very nice and the prices were very reasonable compared to the states...but what isn't these days.

The hotel has a Starbucks and Coffee Bean & Tea just outside hotels back entrance. There are two malls adjacent to the hotel, one very nice luxury and the other mid-tier.

Love: the gym

Right off the bat - the service was overly nice, but inhospitable.

1. Arrived late to the due flights - right away, I was told I'd still be charged for the extra day (I was supposed to arrive early in the AM, but got here late in the afternoon)
2. Reminded (that despite my long stay), no breakfast was included
3. I arrived to the hotel 5 days into my stay after very long traffic - I had to use the restroom badly - went to the gym (where I workout daily) to use the bathroom - wasn't allow to use it. (who doesn't let a GUEST use the bathroom). NOR, was I directed to the public restroom down the hallway. The woman laughed and said ""NO - SORRY MA'AM""
4. Wasn't allow to sit in lobby and work with an outside cup of coffee
5. Lobby restaurant - coffee is 205 php for a 6 oz cup of DRIP coffee - NO REFILLS
6. Was interrupted during breakfast to complete a survey
7. Received flowers during my stay- I asked if I could borrow a vase - instead I was directed to the flower shop, who tried to sell me one.

"This review pertains to my stays at Edsa Shangrila Hotel, Philippines from Nov 12-Dec16, 2015 and from Jan 18-Feb 9, 2016.

Same with my past experiences with this great hotel, I had been treated very well by the ever friendly and efficient staff of
Edsa Shangri-la.

I was never wrong in recommending and having 5 of my guests stay in this hotel as well, as all I heard from them are the good
praises and experiences that they said they had not felt in other hotels.

In room check in and check out were a breeze.
Breakfast at Heat restaurant has ever been satisfying. You would think that staying there for 7 weeks would make you get tired
of the same food every day. However, this wasn’t the case. As aside from the huge variety of dishes, and delicacies that they offer, I was
also impressed on the consistent excellent service the staff has given me. Table has been prepared, no need to ask for a cup of cappuccino
as they know my preference already. And yes, the plate of sliced sweet mangoes that I get, proactively served by Mr. Lawrence.
I also would like to make special mention of Mr. Noah and Mr. PaulM who will make you feel like they were personally assigned to you
as they are always there whenever I need anything else.
Last, but not the least, I would like to thank Ms. May and Ms Roan, who always make sure that I get quickly accommodated.

Moving on to the Guest Relations, I would like to compliment the team of Ms Joy Reyes, who were always cheerful and professional,
even on many occasions that they are fully occupied in assisting influx of guests.
Special mention to Ms. Vianny, who diligently kept us informed on the status of getting accommodations for my 5 guests, which
unfortunately coincided during the week when the hotel has maxed occupancy. She somehow was able to pull it through !

However, there was one thing that seemed to have changed. During my last couple of weeks stay , there were at least three
incidences wherein I had difficulty getting connected to the guest relations desk to inquire about questions me and my guests have.
I had to go down to the lobby only to find out that no one was present on the guest relations desk. And all of those times, I can only
see one who was probably helping out in the front office/reception.
In my previous stays, there was always someone in the guest relations desk who is always available to help in-house guests.
Another personal opinion is regarding the uniforms. The new design looks classy, however, they were worn by both guest relations
and front office, which sometimes makes it challenging to distinguish which one to approach for specific reasons.

Overall, it was still a pleasant and enjoyable stay at Edsa Shangri-la, and will definitely come back on my future travels to Manila.
I just do hope that they will consider the concern on availability of the guest relations staff.",Staff:Food
"I'm fine with the rooms and facilities but the service both at the Reception/Lobby and the internet connection needed a lot of improvement. I mean a LOT to be called Shangri La.

The open concept lobby and the multiple entrance is not well manned to be able to provide the supposed signature of Shangri La. The staffs are not to be seen or busy doing something else, apart from welcoming a new arrival. I have to actually dragged my luggage at least 12 steps up with no one to help until the security spotted me not to help but to check my luggage with his cute K9. And then, of course, second thought of helping out til the door and then back to me dragging my luggage. Failed indeed.

For a business hotel, the internet connection kept on dropping. They finally gave me a plug/wire so I can connect on the line...note, mobility and speed are key to business people. Failed indeed.

I would have been more forgiving if it was not Shangri La i.e. Richmond Hotel or other Shaw Edsa hotels. But I've experienced amazing service in other Shangri La and I have forgiven some of it's hotels even if the rooms are slightly old and dated.

Anyway, I hope they can do better with other guests in the future. They tried talking to me but talk is cheap. Standards are important for hotels that are supposed to have high standards. I moved 2 nights later to Discovery Primea which was fabulous and fantastic with excellent service and people to make one's stay perfect.

We were given additional tissue and an ac converter when requested in addition to a 2 p.m. late check out.

For example she would be getting her dental clean up while I would be having my breakfast at the Heat restaurant. I especially enjoyed receiving a portion of fresh mango as I finished my last course at the breakfast buffet. What I least liked was the traffic to and from this hotel to other large shopping areas in Manila like MOA or South Mall and being locked out while clearing my luggage right at 2 p.m. I was particularly given a renascent vision to travel more during my stay here. We would definitely recommend a stay here any time in the near future for ourselves and family or friends!",Food:Staff:Location
"I feel really bad to rate this hotel simply average just because of the experience getting to the hotel for check-in and getting out of the hotel after check-out.

Getting to the hotel with a car, the queue was so long I had to wait in line for 45 minutes just to get inside the hotel compound. The situation was not helped by some vehicles going against the flow of traffic to cut the queue. Despite this, the security personnel did not seem to mind telling off those unruly drivers. Is it because those vehicles that are cutting queues happen to be Expeditions, Land Cruisers, Prados, and Patrols (vehicles rich goons in the country usually drive)?

Upon turning over the car to a valet, I was actually not surprised that the queue for the check-in was equally long. I waited an hour for me to be assigned a room. The people in the check-in counter were very courteous and that was enough to lessen my annoyance.

The room we booked was in the Tower Wing, with an obstructed view of the pool area. The room was nice and is average-sized. Everything in the room worked well. The beds were comfortable, it is a pity that their pillows sucked. Lying on those pillows felt like lying on no pillows at all. We did find out that the hotels offer different kinds of pillows. However, when we called to have our pillows replaced on our second night, the person said she would check for availability and get back to us, but that was the last we heard from guest services.

The situation at the pool was no different, the pool area was so crowded that once you manage to get into the water that is pretty much the position you will be in until you decide to get out of the pool.

The queue for breakfast was equally bad. My family went to the breakfast area at 7:30 AM and had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. On our last day there, we went to the breakfast area around 15 minutes earlier and this time, we only waited 10 minutes to be seated. The plus sides to the breakfast wast that variety of the breakfast is very good and the taste was also very good.

Another plus side of our stay in this hotel is that it is located between 2 big malls. The hotel has a walkway connecting to Shangri-La Plaza when accessed through the Garden Wing and is just a few steps away from SM Megamall when using the hotel's main entrance. When you find the hotel's facilities to crowded, you could stroll around these malls.

The check-out process itself was a breeze for us - less than 5 minutes, however we again waited for more than 40 minutes for the valet to get our car.

Overall, this staycation had all the potential to be a relaxing one. However, the fact that we spent more time queuing up than enjoying what the hotel has to offer spoiled a lot for us.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"There was a long check-in queue as soon as we entered the lobby. A few employees were going around saying that they are fully booked and that they apologize. One requested for our IDs and instructed us to check in at the horizon lounge since we got horizon rooms.
Located at the 14th floor, the wait continued there though at least now, we can have cappuccino, mango juice and cookies while waiting.
My children were staring at the crass look of stocking edges of the front desk officers' peeping thighs as they were sitting down and some standing since their skirt slits were up and high as can be. It was funny as these booking officers sat and huddled together, the scene looked like a gentleman's club. I do get the whole look they were trying to convey, but a little adjustment to a more decent level wouldn't hurt for a hotel which can be considered a family hotel.
We finally checked in at 430pm, after a 2 hour wait, but the other room we booked got cleaned at 6pm already. The room smelled strongly of a cheap spray which activated our allergies.
The rooms at the garden wing need some uplifting, especially the bathrooms.
On the upside, the pool was lovely inspite the crowd, the walkway to the mall was a convenience, and the very accommodating servers at Heat restaurant where there was Wagyu Night (Yay!) were very friendly and attentive.
We used to stay here a lot because of the service and quality accommodations but I guess will not return during holidays. For a landmark hotel that has seen Manila's ups and downs year-in and year-out, they have to be already seemlessly trained by now in cases of full capacity.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"It was a wonderful experience to indulge
in luxurious comfort with fluffy , clean blanket , linen n all amenities like my home sweet home! The safe environment made a relaxing stay n stress free. The high ceiling n airy lobby as well as the surrounding landscape and a lot of variety of breakfast food buffet at the Heat Restaurant contributed
to an enjoyable n restful stay. My stay would not have been enjoyable without the fantastic and helpful guards, guard dogs , porter , housekeeping, hosts , hostess, and luggage storage staff . The proximity and walking distance of the
Eucharistic Catholic Church , theaters and shopping centers are all a big plus into making my almost 10 days into the happiest ,peaceful n perfect vacation. Congratulations to the management and personnel for creating an outstanding
BEACON for your guests!!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"Been staying on this hotel for the past 6 years or so but this holyweek staycation.is the worst... starting on the day we arrived i was made to drve my car to the parkinglot because valet people not available and wait for 40 min before the valet guy gave me my parking ticket, then came the checkin i was told that i could upgrade to a room in the tower wing with a view on the pool below for a promo fee only to be taken to a smaller room with obstructed pool view and when i requested for transfer oh its not available... sucks and ive been a golden circle member since like more than 5 years ago... then came the the early morning routine have to call the guest relation office for my morning paper while in the other room i can see their newspaper hanging by their door. Then breakfast came we need to fall in line for 50 min standing and once inside, the food and plates were not available even the simple butter for the bread and most of the pastries and dimsum stations were empty have to wait for 10 min...what happen to the 5 star service that we got used to have in all shangri la hotels...i know its holy week but hello.... you could have provided chairs to those people lining up waiting for more than 40 min especially the ones with children and senior citizens... tssk...mega blunder for the management people. Instead of having a relaxing stay its stressful one!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
I have stayed in many great hotels over the years. This is probably one of my best experiences taking into account we arrived just before Holy Week. The staff could not do enough for us and the service was outstanding. The room was clean and fresh and of 5 star standard.,Staff:Cleanliness
"We had a great experience at the EDSA Shangri-La two years ago and were looking forward to this visit. We were not disappointed. The hotel is still beautiful and the staff is still the most conscientious in the business. We enjoyed breakfast and lunch at the Heat restaurant, as well as a special Japanese beef dinner. The children of our relatives in Manila were allowed to enjoy the pools, and they did. Staying at the EDSA after a long flight from New York is our way of regenerating ourselves. A bonus this year was watching the huge New York snowstorm on CNN. We felt brilliant.",Food:Staff
