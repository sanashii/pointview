"Can't really comment on the rooms as we just held an event here. From our experience, everything was on point except the service. The wait staff were nice, but poorly trained. Service took unusually long, which is definitely not something you want when you're hosting a business forum.",Staff
"Horizon Club spoiled our stay.

Booked a club access floor and discovered restrictive policies on dress code and prohition on children during cocktail hours.

Lack of alternatives and initiative to present these made it worse.

Staff seem ""entitled"" to something. Appeal to some sort of target market.

Horrible experience over-all. Not recommending to families.

""Weekend treat"" offer did not match expectations of a relaxing weekend.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"this is a really high-end 5 star resort hotel in a very central location in Manila. The room was incredibly spacious and luxurious, and had everything we needed. The sports facilities are truly epic - three floors including multiple pools, squash, tennis and basketball courts and a huge gym. The breakfast and evening buffets were really very good too.

"Shangri-La never disappoints, whether here in Manila or in other Asian cities.

Their newest offering at the Fort is perfect for families, where kids can spend an entire afternoon just playing at the pools (three in all).

Its location also offers close proximity to several dining options within the building, or along nearby High Street.

The rooms are spacious and elegantly decorated, with its muted beige and neutral colors.

The only critique I have is the underwhelming lobby. This was my niece's first comment when we first entered to check in. It isn't as grand as the lobbies of its predecessors (Makati and EDSA).",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I had a standard room which was decorated in a calming, relaxing way, with plenty of space.

The staff gave a very warm welcome throughout the hotel - reception, concierge, bellboy, wait-staff, security, housekeeping, etc

Security was a bit over the top. I know it is fairly standard in this city for your car to be stopped before entering the hotel grounds to be checked by a small troop of security guards and dogs. That happened. And then when I was out of the car I also had to put all my luggage through an xray machine and walk through a metal detector. Well, when I say all of my luggage, my suitcase was too big (despite being a fairly standard medium sized suitcase) to fit through the aperture of their xray machine so they had to take a risk and let me in with it without it being xray'd.

The pool area has cabanas and sun loungers. It isn't exactly a secluded spot though as it is overlooked by several neighbouring office buildings. These buildings also provide shade from the sun so not ideal for those seeking a bit of sun exposure.

On check-out I was asked if I wanted a car. Knowing the hotel has its own car service providing superior cars for a vastly superior fee I politely declined and asked the concierge to order me a regular taxi. It was at a time of day and with weather conditions that conducive to taxis being readily available. .....and in Manila it doesn't matter what car you are in, if there is traffic en route to the airport you will be stuck in it!

The block on which the Shangri-La sits is still a building site. The hotel side is ostensibly complete although some shops/restaurants outside are still to open. The other half is still very much under construction.

It is a good location though. On a good day, you are perhaps just 15 minutes drive from T3 of NAIA. You are a short walk from Bonifacio High Street with all its shops, restaurants, cinema and random events on one side. On the other side of the hotel is the Mind Museum and then Burgos Circle, another area for restaurants. It is also just a short walk from St Lukes Medical Centre, one of the better hospitals in the country.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"The Shangri-La at the Fort is another strong addition to Shangri-La's portfolio of hotel in the Philippines.The hotel is quite new and is in excellent physical condition. The staff is amazingly attentive, friendly, and service orientated. The rooms and facilities are luxurious.

I was only able to eat in the main restaurant (High Street Cafe), the associated lounge (High Street Lounge), and the gym. All three were quite good. The main buffet (in HS Cafe) is perhaps smaller than in other Shangri-La, but is very high quality. I did not try out the three specialized restaurants-- they are pricey but seem promising.

But as a new hotel, it is still working out a few minor edges. The room service menu is relatively limited compared to the food available in the main restaurant; with time, this will improve. Likewise, some service requests were a bit slow, such as requests for ice. Others, such as printing out documents, were remarkably efficient.

The location is excellent, in easy walking distance to a number of restaurants and stores. It is generally easy to a call a car from Uber or Grab and there are also a lot of taxis available on the street. Market Market and SM Aura are within walking distance.

I stayed here for almost three weeks and I would not hesitate to stay here again.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I would have rated this hotel 5 stars without hesitation but for two incidents. I stayed at a one bedroom suite at the Residences for 9 nights. The room was beautiful and designed for the comfort of the guests. However, the a/c broke down during the middle of the night and it took a whole day to fix it. I had a few guests that day and unfortunately, we were perspiring during our meeting. The following night, I found a cockroach in the bathroom. The staff came to clean immediately but J believe that a 5-star hotel of this quality and price should ensure that these things don't happen. Lots of apologies were given by the staff with a bottle of wine and chocolate cookies. Not sure I can get over the cockroach experience as it was pretty disgusting!",Staff:Cleanliness:Value for money

1. It was central to the places that we wanted to see.

3. 24 hour access to a fantastic gym called Kerry Sports, which includes a full indoor basketball court that my family enjoyed.

"This hotel is fine if you have money to waste but if your looking to get your money's worth Ascott across the road looks nice I haven't stayed there yet but Shangri-La is trying to sell a fake 5 star experience lol it's like a business hotel but with bells and whistle no one has no idea on what they are doing or how to manage a hotel.
Hotel deco- clean and plain no real character no feeling kinda like walking into a shopping mall.
The location is nice it's in the middle of the fort close drive to makati and you can walk around the city to restaurants.
Service - rubbish
Food - it's ok, the high tea is no good, cocktails average, buffet is ok.
The rooms - clean and modern quiet relaxing i heard ppl complaining about construction noise I didn't hear anything.
The gym - this is the only thing worth stay the gym is amazing it has a basketball court and all the only annoying thing is they have off premise customers so a lot of the machines will be full or the basketball court will be booked which means it's not really for the customers but it's worth checking out.
Overall I am going to check out the ascott next time if your here for business it's fine but I feel sorry for anyone on vacation I would be really annoyed with the lack of professionalism.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
The hotel is new and beautiful. I am assuming once it has been open a bit longer the negatives can be polished and the hotel can reach the standard it has the potential to be. I stayed for 14 days for a business trip-working evenings. The hotel ask at check-in what time you would like the room cleaned. I do not know why they even bothered because almost everyday they came in the middle of the afternoon. I had to make sure I kept the do not disturb light on. They certainly did not pay any attention to my request or my other co-workers. The mini-bar was not kept stocked even when I would call down to request. I had to change rooms due to banging from construction. You would think if I had advised I had to sleep in the day they would not put me in a room that had construction going on in the room beside and above me. For that matter if you are staying at this hotel who wants to be subject to that noise anyway? I came to my room one day and my window had been opened. I had to call to have one shut it because it required some type of tool. Unsure why they would open a window on the 29th floor. Our first night at the hotel we went to the Café Lounge for a cocktail. We were welcomed by a mouse that was running around the floor. I know there are rodents in the city however I do not think it is ridiculous not to expect to see them in the lounge. The food was very good. My only disappointment would be in a high end hotel and they are preparing something at a buffet and it will not be ready for 10 minutes. I think it is very rude for you to be asked to come back. It should have been delivered to the table. I also think the same about the omelet bar once ordered it should be delivered you should not be expected to stand around and wait.,Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"We had a good time for our family staycation at Shangri-La at the Fort. Upon check-in, the staff are all attentive and ready to assist. Checking-in and out was a breeze, the reservation was accurate and as requested we had an adjoining room.

The grandness of the hotel is already visible upon entry. The wide spaces and grand chandelier is there for everyone to feast their eyes on. The modern elegance of the hotel can be felt from its service down to its people. The rooms are spacious and amenities are complete, the basics are covered. Though I was hoping that all rooms would have better coffee (like a Nespresso or equivalent machine). One minor hiccup on the room is that since the units are still fairly new there may be a certain sting to your eyes when you enter in it but it eventually lessens and fades after some time. To hasten it, you can ask for an ionizer from housekeeping.

Location here is excellent. Just a walk away is Central Square (a small mall) for your retail therapy and food offering is abundant at Bonifacio High Street. It is very convenient if you are just looking to roam around the area.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

My very first time staying at a Shangrila hotel chain. It happens to be one of the newer hotels by Shangrila located at the fort in Bonifacio Global City. My main reason for the stay is to attend my cousins wedding. This was her venue for her reception. The location of the hotel is in a very convenient area where shopping stores and restaurants are just across the street. My room was excellent and the view was amazing. I enjoyed the breakfast the most due their wide variety of food choices. I looked forward to that every single morning. I also got a chance to check out their pool area which is overlooking the city. It was very nice and relaxing. The staff were very friendly and always accommodating. I would definitely come back here again.,Location:Staff:Food
"New and more modern than Shangril Makati. However I think the lobby is much bigger and the buffet breakfast has a wider spread in Shangrila Makati. Service as expected is excellent. Also if you need to be in BGC than better to book here since traffic in Manila is terrible. A 3km drive would take about 45 minutes!

Also the view is bad even if my room was on the 36th floor. Try to get a room facing BGC and not the other side.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

The bathroom is all marble with an awesome rain shower head in the shower - best shower I've had. There is also a large soaking tub. The bed is luxurious. A la carte restaurant has great options, and the buffet is divine with such a large selection of food. Service is a little slow.

Not to mention, that the receptionist was friendly and very accommodating to my requests.
Being one of the newest hotels in the area, the twin-bedroom that we stayed in was on its almost-perfect state - very clean, well kept, sufficiently lighted and ventilated, had comfortable sheets and pillow. The toilet was spacious too.
Aside from having a great location, good service, and best meals, Shangri-la at the Fort even has the best amenities that a hotel could have: high-end equipment at Kerry Gym, pools with great views, indoor basketball court, tennis court, to name a few.

The shower door was not closing properly so the water leaked out during showers.
They told us that breakfast is served until 10am only on January 2. When we got there at 9 am, there was a line and you had to wait for an hour at least just to get a table. Its the first time I had to fall in line in a buffet breakfast especially in a five star hotel. I don't understand why they didn't open the other venues for breakfast just to accomodate the influx of people. Yesterday, January 1, they opened a whole ballroom for breakfast and that was very convenient for everyone. With the number of hotel guests, they should have properly made things convenient but i guess this hotel's service to customers is not their utmost priority.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Sadly the Shangri-La at the Fort failed to live up to the standard of other Shangri-La hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at over the last 25 years in Asia. From check-in at 2pm when one of our rooms was ready and the other not ready for an hour or so later, to failing to set up the spare bed that was booked until midnight, having requested it three times, once at check in as per our booking, once before dinner and once when we got back from dinner. Breakfast at High Street Cafe on the 24th December was basically good, on the 25th breakfast was moved to the ballroom. The choice of food was restricted and the set up so spread out it was like a zoo. Some basic things like one egg station with one person working on it for hundreds of guests is a recipe for long queues and unhappy guests (there were both). The following day High Street Cafe couldn't cope with the volume of guests and again disgruntled guests. The main swimming pool was closed but the one at Kerry Club was open. The only highlight of the stay was a good family dinner in Samba. I would certainly return for a relaxed informal family dinner. Overall the experience at the hotel fell short of expectations and I would not return to stay with the family.",Food

Amenities, grounds - very aesthetically pleasing interiors! I got this feminine vibe in this hotel, this would be perfect if you want to treat your gf/wife/mom/etc :) The hotel has two pools - the Kerry Sports pool and the other one which wasn't open yet (we stayed July 2016). There was another pool which is for residents only. Hotel has some restaurants, a bar, and a few shops on the first floor, and a park beside it. It was also near malls, restaurants, and night life. Their fitness center is a very large sports facility, it is a brand in itself, as it is Kerry Sports Manila.

Food - Shangri-la has always been known for their buffets, the High Street Cafe buffet breakfast did not disappoint! Loads of variety, perfect for people on extended stays.

What we didn't like: the toilet didn't have a bidet, and the rooms were small, though the space was efficiently used, and the aesthetics made up for the size. Some lights didn't work, and if you look closely, some finishing touches were not neatly done (Sorry, I should have taken pictures), which was a let down because this is one of the newest and priciest hotels in the city.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

This hotel is a show- stopper, the decor pretty much no-expanse-spared. We gazed at the 3500 pieces that make up the crystal chandelier while crossing the lobby.

"I've stayed at several different Shangri-La hotels in major Asian cities. Each one has been very nice, and the new Shangri-La at the Fort in the Bonifacio Global City neighborhood of Manila is certainly no exception to that rule. The staff deserve high credit for their helpfulness, courtesy, knowledge (including knowledge of English), and overall friendliness (""it's more fun in the Philippines!"") As with every other Shangri-La I've stayed at, this one is a higher-end business class hotel with all of the expected amenities - spa, large exercise facility, multiple restaurants and lounges on site. The rooms are nice and spacious, with excellent working space and comfortable beds.

The breakfast buffet is amazing in its breadth and quality, from fresh fruits to freshly-baked pastries (including local specialties) to traditional American breakfasts to European, and every imaginable Asian breakfast food.

If i had one reservation, it would be the wi-fi, which i sometimes found to be slow.

Also, be aware that the hotel is located in Bonifacio Global City. If you're looking for ""traditional"" Filipino culture, it'll take some effort to find. The BGC area looks like a large American city shopping mall, complete with Pottery Barn, Gap, Nike stores, and American chain restaurants (and some high-end stores like Ferragamo and Rolls Royce). Getting to Intramuros will take 45 minutes. And you should plan on at least the same amount of time to the airport.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

Samba- best new restaurant in town! I can't stop coming back for the food and great service! Kudos to everyone who served me...wine, Dawn, Ryan, Chef Carlo and sorry for the others that I forgot. Your Pisco Sour was too good to be true. Best restaurant so far! Keep up the great work!!!!! Can't wait for the bar and pool to open. One suggestion.... play lounge music to make your Peruvian restaurant more eclectic! Hotel Costes? Supper club? Chainsmokers ? What's so not Gemini? (A good DJ would know what I mean...)... we know you are Peruvian... would've been another great surprise for guests to eat great Peruvian food with a twist!

The Raging Bull - love Ryan from Pampanga and Mico Chua. Avoid Chloe! She's so rude... I asked for their Belgium beer selection and she rudely said Stella Artois! A beer that we were already about to order because it was listed. Hello???? Have you heard of the monks who make Chimay????? I've been to Belgium. Chloe... have you? Please don't ruin the SHANG's Fort struggling 8 star aspirations.

Shang Lounge- met Angela who served us well. The manager Josephine was off so didn't get to see her. Too bad.... the lounge logistics is still not appropriately staff given the way it's set up. Centralized communication within staff whether electronic or manual need a lot of improvement. Be sure not to assume that if you told one hostess something ( like your drink order) that everyone else knows. And if you need something, just stand up and go to one of the inattentive hostesses for service.

Horizon Lounge - Claudine was great, Melody was great. I forgot all other staff's name but consistently great. Downfall.... they focused too much on food, drinks and guest outfits! The horizon lounge falls short on actually being the Front desk replacement for VIPs. I should be able to ask them anything and more that I would normally do at the front desk. Definitely not there yet. ...

"Well, we had a resident suite despite only staying two nights, as the hotel was full with a conference.
The hotel is still in 'soft opening' mode, so there were a few minor wrinkles. Apparently not all the rooms are available, and only one of the two pools was open. (dear me, I'm born to suffer).
Oddly, from a resident suite to the breakfast area takes 3 lifts (elevators for the non-Brits).

Breakfast was a bit crowded, but the buffet is incredibly expansive, from croissant to sushi via English, Chinese, Philippine and others.

My children and I arrived for a one night stay and most team members knew it was my son's 7th birthday and my children and I were continuously greeted by name. The lobby is beautiful, with its Shangri-La scent and the check in process was a great experience. So kind, professional, personalized and focused on the children - beautiful! The room was amazing, located on 20th floor and with 180 degree views over Manila - the view alone is an amazing highlight, overlooking Manila's modern skyline and seeing the beautiful natural scenery of Metro Manila. What really become highlights for us was (1) The Adventure Zone, a children's ""paradise"" - so clean, well managed, exciting, (2) The gym which in size, concept and richness I have never seen before in my life, conveying a certain energy just by walking through and (3) the highly innovative F&B. The breakfast was absolutely amazing, so natural, interactive, fresh and engaging how it was presented - great F&B innovation. Last but not least, worth mentioning the beautiful birthday card, signed by hotel management and a delicious cake, that we found in our room upon arrival to celebrate my son's 7th birthday. An absolute MUST for anyone traveling to Manila and who is passionate about great hospitality. Thank You dear Shangri-La The Fort Manila Team! Daniel, Salma, Vito",Staff:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Stayed for 2 nights for business. The hotel is amazing is almost all aspects. The staff immediately greet you upon arrival and start taking care of you in all regards. I arrived around midnight and worked on a BST time schedule. The rooms are very spacious and have a unique feature with the TV sound coming through the bathroom to create an almost surround sound in the room. I had the opportunity to eat at all of the restaurants in the hotel and all were great, but on the normal hotel cost expense side. I had room service 2 times around 3 am for dinner and the food was great and the expense for room service was actually quite well.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"The hotel is fairly new. Rooms are very clean, spacious and well appointed. The breakfast buffet is one of the best, so many different cuisines to choose from and all very good quality. The waffle girls make amazing waffles, they should get a raise ;)

What makes this hotel is the staff. All the staff are just incredible and try so hard to make their guests happy. This is the only hotel to stay in at Manila!

Actually I do have one complaint- Service in the Bar just off the lobby was terrible. It took 30 mins to get a drink on a Tuesday night and the bar was practically empty. The cocktail was one of the best I've ever had but just took too long and was hard to find someone to take our order.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

Shangrila @the Fort is one of the best hotels I've been to. The rooms have wonderful interiors. I like the lounge where you get to sit and enjoy drinks while catching up with friends and family.

Impressive spread of food from local favourites to international fare.Thumbs up! Will definitely be back!,Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

We are here for a conference and with a big group! Rooms are great and spacious! I am particularly impressed by the breakfast, they serve Hainan Chicken Rice one morning

Conference facilities are great and the staff are very helpful!

Will surely be back to enjoy the Executive Club Lounge when it is opened!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I stayed here for six nights. The hotel still only has two restaurants open , apart from the high st cafe and the lounge. It has approx half of the rooms open.

On the negative the corridors smell of what seems to be a glue smell . When I got to a third room and three hours later and only then after I had the duty manager get the timber panelled walls wiped down did the smell subside a little, it seemed the dust on the walls was a major contributor to the smell. Even after that I went over to the Runstans market and bought a solid and a spray air freshener, spraying every day made it ok.

Housekeeping is average, skipped topping things up twice and then lost some of my laundry never to be found.

Breakfast in the High Street cafe is good and lookout for Kevin who is service focused , an asset to the team !

The Gym is amazing , over two levels with everything you need and some and because the hotel is only 50% open approx it is not packed, even during the regular hotel morning leak before 8 am.

To sum up staying here was less than average given it is supposed to be a five star Shang. It feels more like a four star traders or less. The GM needs to get his house keeping functioning well rather than focusing on high profile events on a Saturday night, that way the Shang brand may be fulfilled. Oh and please do not reply with a standard reply if you choose to , placating only works if it is followed by action and it is too late for that as I have left.",Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I stayed at the Shangri-La at the Fort for the first time and was delighted by the room and the service. Great location at the end of High Street just off of 5th Avenue. Most of my meetings were in the area and I was able to walk to most. The only negative was that, being a brand new property, there was still some residual construction going on so there were some noisy periods during the day. Business kept me there through Saturday morning and I must note that the brunch was vast and excellent! It will be interesting to compare the soon to be completed Hyatt once it opens, but the Shang sets a high bar.",Location:Comfort & Facilities

"Last time I stayed at a Shangri-la was a few years ago at Boracay. I was impressed the moment I arrived, their costumes or uniform where fit to the resort concept, huge center flower arraignment gave its class above the rest.

While here at Fort the uniforms where a bit confused for me, not sure of the hotel's positioning such that I had to inquire what star was this hotel. I didn't see any huge flower arraignment, so kinda lacked the wow factor here.

However, room was very well made and appointed spacious, huge bathroom, very comfortable bedding which I slept most of my stay, that I enjoyed very much, kudos!

Food was great and reasonably priced. Waitresses looked like they came from prestigious schools, spoke very fluent English grammar and were very charming which matches their hip uniform.

Great place to stay for staycation!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We opted to have a staycation for my husband's birthday and see what a 7 star hotel has to offer. The location is very good, walking distance to shops & restaurants. The room hallway had a horrendous smell, like rotten salami, they lessened it but it was still there (Rm 2316). Huge room & bathroom but kettle and instant coffee instead of pods. Decor is nice but not impressive. I guess I expected too much for 7 stars. It could be better.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location

"The driveway and the entrance gives you a sense of how generous the hotel is with space. Check-in was line-free and very efficient, quite a consistent finding with Shangri-La hotels. It was a little disappointing, though, to have experienced a dog-like smell as we got off the elevator on our assigned floor. We assumed that it was construction-related as we heard some muffled machine-like noise in the background. Entering the room was a different story. It was fresh, very subdued Asian, and spacious. Breakfast was also definitely satisfying and quite relaxed, as there was no elbow-to-elbow experience along the buffet spread.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness

"Tried this hotel for the first time. I usually stayed in Makati area before but now BGC seems to be a very good option. Stayed for 3 nights this week. I have to say this is probably the best business hotel in Manila for me.

Check-in is fast and efficient. Service is friendly and accommodating. The breakfast spread is amazing! Many choices - Filipino, Western, Asian cuisine, all are done nicely. I typically eat very little breakfast but Shangri-la buffet spread makes me want to try more!

Gym is very big and spacious. Again, one of the best I've ever seen. Room is bright and comfortable.

All in all, excellent hotel. Two feedbacks for them to improve - watch out on maintaining the furniture. The table in the lift corridor looks worn out. Also there is still strong smell of new carpets (or paint?) in the corridor. Hope to see them fix this the next time.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"On a recent trip to Manila I was fortunate to stay at the Shangri-la at the Fort. For context, I am a plant based person and endurance athlete.

Check in was smooth and I was quickly shown to my room. The process was smooth which is appreciated after time in Manila traffic. This is a new property so everything is as new and staff are friendly and attentive. You're greeted with natural light and extremely high ceilings.

My first morning I arrived at the level 6 gym at 6am. I cannot share enough positives on the partnership with Kerry Gyms as I was blown away by the expansive, light filled, immaculate space. It has a full sized basketball court!

During my stay I was focused on strength training so I was extremely happy to see a massive selection of free weights, machines, and more. With the CrossFit trend, this gym even has tractor tires if you want to erm...toss them around? All free weights and machines are brand new and in immaculate working order. Should you prefer cardio there are a dozen brand new fixed wheel spin bikes (that measure Wattage!), treadmills, and more. There is even a nice selection clothes to buy and drinks and food should you want to eat immediately post workout.

To the hotel, the rooms are immaculate and well laid out. There was still some minor odor in my room post construction however this was more akin to the smell of fresh paint than anything negative. *Note, if you enjoy in-room dining, Shangri-la now has their menu in a magazine in the room. This takes some searching. It's not the standard hard backed binder.

Looking to the menu, if you are a non-animal product eater you will find the menu quite limited at breakfast. My selection included a fruit plate, 2 bananas and a black coffee. Vegetarians may fair better.

When the fruit plate did arrive it was lovely and fresh. The coffee was fine. All was delivered to the room in a reasonable amount of time with punctual and focused service.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

"A new destination in MetroManila, a treat as we were directed to a new place without passing through the monstrous traffic at EDSA. The serene ambience would tell you that its a new hotel. It had its soft opening barely four months ago. Since i took the early morning flight from the province i visited prior to my coming to this hotel, i have some
extra bags although i would be staying for just one night. The concierge people accommodated my request to leave my bag although i do not have a room yet. I personnally acknowledge Mr. Kenneth D for his big help. He was very accommodating. His warm welcome smile, typical of a Shangri-La staff would make one feel at home.

I had the opportunity to take my breakfast at the lobby restaurant. As expected for a Shangri-La hotel, they have a variety of food to choose from. The staff at the restaurant were nice, friendly and efficient.
O
Our sponsor was able to negotiate for an early check in for provincial participants who came very early [ because of early morning flights from the provinces ] There were just less than 10 of us but the staff designated for our check in [ we have a group check in assigened for us at the third floor ] created confusion to us, ktired particiapnts from the pronvinces. Some doctors were even asked to go up to the third floor for registration, then was advised again to go down to the front desk, then go up again!

The room was clean, tidy and very nice! The housekeeping did a great job in making our room very convenient and organized.

Our venue in one of the ballrooms at the third floor was ideal. Excellent audio visual equipments, good lights and clean room. Food served for our lunch, snack and dinner were delicious and great. Again, some of the staff were not properly informed of our ll'functions. When we asked for our drinks, they have to go back to their supervisor to inquire! In our experiences, whether a regular or casual waiters would know what drinks goes with our meals
I hope that next time i go back to this place, their staff would be still be efficient, courteous and with a warm Shangri-La smiles on their faces",Staff:Food

"Great location......that's all I can say about this new hotel by Shangri-La at the Fort. Wife and I chose this hotel to do our anniversary R & R staycation. I thought the suite was ok except for the squeaky wooden flooring in the dining area (thumbs down #1). The view was pretty nice except for the view of the ropes used by the window cleaners (thumbs down #2). Wanted to check out the Horizon Club but found out that it was still under construction (thumbs down #3). Next disappointment was no fault of the hotel but the people above us were quite noisy. Had to endure constant sound of ""heavy walking"" till about 2am. Next morning I woke up to not so loud but constant construction noise (thumbs down #4). Couple of times during the stay, people rang the door bell to ask if we needed anything and if we wanted flowers. I'm thinking why wouldn't you put the flowers there before we got there? Also, I'm totally capable of calling if I need something (thumbs down #5). Some folks might like that but not us. When checking out, I ""discussed"", not complained, about the noise level and all I got from the staff was ""awwwww"" (thumbs down #6).
That said, if you're looking for some R & R staycation, I recommend you wait till they are 100% ready before spending your hard earn $$$. Shangri-La is a great brand name I trust and used before and I'm sure they'll get better before you know it.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Staff
"The place is really new and is in soft opening. Some of the areas still have a faint smell of paint. The 6th-floor pool is a bit small but there is another pool on the 8th floor under construction.

I asked the staff about big events and they could accommodate around 800 sit-down guest.",Comfort & Facilities
"I loved staying in this new property because the location is great! You can pretty much walk to anywhere in the Fort from there. The front desk staff is always willing to help and I love that they remember you after your second visit. My first stay there, I was given an obviously newly painted room (you could smell it!) but the second time (longer stay, too) my room was devoid of the freshly painted smell.
The biggest plus for me was the gym, Kerry Sports. I like to run and work out during work trips and I love that it's open 24 hours a day. I have yet to try the other amenities and classes that the gym has to offer so I'm actually looking forward to my stay there this month.
Funny that when you order room service, someone always tries to sell you dessert (I've caved more than once so I guess it's effective, haha!) but I can imagine how the enthusiastic conversations might be a bit too much for over worked people who just want to order a meal and put the phone down.

"I'm not the big fan of Shangri-La but I enjoy staying in Shangri-la every time, except this time in Shangri-La at the Fort Manila. Apart from the issue of room cleanliness, the basic design has some issues.

1. No light switch can control the down light at luggage area. Once this down light is switched on by interting keycard, you cannot switch off this ""bright"" down light that very annoying during sleeping.
2. One lighting under vanity counter in bathroom is the same issue, without light switch control. The solution is to close the bathroom door before you go to bed.
3. The bath tub do not have enough space for you lay down. When you want to enjoy the bath and lay down, your head will hit on the glass panel of shower cubicle.
4. The shower cubicle cannot hold the water properly. After shower, you have do some housekeeping job because the water was spilt out on the floor.
5. Noisy air conditioning.",Comfort & Facilities

Otherwise, the experience is fine!",Staff:Food
"Nothing bad much to say except the rooms feels smaller compared to its class. But the bath and toilets are bigger in proportion to the room. Amenities are awesome, the BEST EVER I have been for a hotel or resort. Its got a pool that has laps, Tennis, squash court. A/C for the Squash and Basketball and outdoor for the tennis and that is on the upper floor. The Gym is 2 floors with huge space for aerobics. The most complete equipment I have seen. ( I cannot even use all for the next 2 hours of workout). Breakfast is very good but typical for its price. Other food on their restaurant is also excellent. Their conference rooms are very cold and beautiful, maybe because its new. Their adventure zone for kids is the largest compared to Mactan and Boracay but you have to pay extra unlike the other 2 location where it is free for a few hours.
Of course the only drawback is the price, 50% to double on some excellent hotels. But your stay is worth it if you don't bother to go out and shop. Heck you can even use their complementary bamboo bikes to roam around the city. But I wish I had another extra day.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"We stayed here for my wife's birthday and we were not disappointed. The hotel is beautiful, living up to the Shangri-La brand. The staff is also trained well. We spent time, for the most part, in the pool and the room. My daughters loved the pool and the staff was very attentive. The hotel even gave my wife a treat for her birthday, with a personalized greeting card. We will definitely go back. Keep it up.

Just a couple minor observations. First was in High Street Cafe during our breakfast. We asked for water and juice but they never came. I just presumed that since there's water and juice in the buffet area, we should just get it there. Would have been nice if the staff informed us that we can get the water and/or juice in that area. Second is that we needed to wait for a short while before staff could get to our luggages when we arrived.

"After my somewhat terrible experience at Makati Shangri-la, my time at Shangri-la At The Fort was exactly the opposite--it is a lifestyle hotel with so many things to do an overnight stay isn't enough.

The rooms are just gorgeous (bigger versions of the EDSA Shangri-la Hotel Tower Rooms) and the bathroom is perfection. I'm so in love with our room (and to think we were only at a deluxe room) that I slept so well.

My toddlers enjoyed the kids zone (despite the strict rules wherein each child must come in long sleeves and pants--maybe to avoid scrapes in the arms and legs?). Kept them busy for an hour. It's the only hotel in Manila with a free indoor play area that big.

Food was superb at the Highstreet Cafe. We also tried the hotdogs in the commercial complex side and it was also pretty good.

There was a time during our stay when we had to leave quickly and leave our eldest son with our nanny and the room key got demagnetized. She asked for assistance at the lobby but this hotel really takes precautions so they had to call my mobile phone before giving her a new set of keys to ask if I did in fact leave my nanny in the room and they made sure I really am who I'm claiming to be.

Left the hotel feeling like our time there wasn't enough. Going to book several rooms for our family on New Year's Eve. Can't wait for the pool in the 8th floor to open in December too.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff

I have never felt more welcome and everyone was so accommodating! The staff was giving us advice on restaurants and our treks coming up. They even sent us extra water after we told them we were going hiking the next day. The bed was HUGE and so comfy, and the bathroom was to die for. We loved this hotel!

But what stands out Shangri-La at the Fort?

Its the GEM of In Room Dining named Ramon Christopher Raymundo!!! A guy very much willing to always and never fails to ""GO an EXTRA MILE"" to make a guest feel so happy, satisfied and pleased with his service.

I love Shangri-la Hotels and i like to try the newest one which is The Fort. I normally staying in Hotels when Im in Manila even if i can stay in sisters home. I enjoyed with my mom and my daughter at first.
When my foreigner husband planned to follow me in Manila, I immediately booked our hotel room again. I checked in at 2:00 pm and i enjoyed the amenities while waiting for my husbands arrival. I fetched him at the airport. The bad service started when they saw me with a foreigner husband. Their eyes were judgemental... their behaviors changed... i dont feel comfortable anymore. When i called them to extend our room they want to give me higher rate but when my husband approached them at the front office, they gave him same rate. What's wrong with u guys?! We travelled to other countries, we stayed in Shangri-la hotels too but i never feel like that.

"Hotel is supposed to be one of the best 5 star hotel but since amenities are still not complete, I can't give this hotel a 5 star. Check in was smooth, room was already available by 10:30am. Room size was okay, furniture in the room were nice. The gym was big and nice. However, wet room in the gym's changing room is still not available for use (sauna and jacuzzi). Also, the only pool available for use is the one near the gym. The main pool is still under construction. There are a lot of food choices and shopping boutiques around the area since hotel is strategically located in the heart of Bonifcaio Global City. The only bad thing we encountered in this hotel is that front desk didn't allow late check out other than 12nn with the reason that the hotel is fully booked. This would be believable if it were a holiday, or a weekend. But we checked out on a regular Monday and clearly, there were no other people checking in even if we checked out at 12:30pm and stayed around the hotel until 2pm. We would appreciate it more if they just told us that it was the hotel policy.

"The lobby and other areas of the hotel are a work of art. Wherever you look, you'll be impressed of various artwork from the time you check-in until you check-out. The High Street Cafe has a very good ambience and food. The Cafe Lounge is a good place at night to chill before going to bed. The rooms are carefully designed and its functionalities are hotel friendly. Staff are good except for room attendant Jay R of housekeeping who went inside the room without even knocking on the door or using their door bell while I am inside (good thing that I am on my clothes) who seems to be an individual employee who did not follow their standards in opening hotel doors. He did apologize but the damage is done,

I am so impressed with their amenities such as the gym. They have squash courts, lap pool, tennis courts, and a whole basketball court! They have free healthy drinks in the gym.

I just hope that they improve their front office procedures such as canceling of their credit card approvals if the guest did not utilize the amount blocked during the stay. I just felt that my concerns were not solved on a satisfactory level and do not have a choice but to accept their apologies.

In a culture that is already very gracious, helpful and kind, the hotel staff take it to the next level. They go out of their way - every day - to make things happen, etc. I'm vegan - and so my choice of breakfast is limited. They were always happy to go off menu, come up with some avocado toast and fresh hummus! without a fuss. I even got the Sous Chef to come and say hi and ask if I was happy.

Many things were still unavailable, like the Club lounge, spa, and swimming pool, so can't really give a full review just yet. Staff still needs to be further trained. They didn't have a dedicated check-in counter for the Suite guests so we would have had to wait in line behind everyone else, if we didn't proactively ask for assistance. Hotel is still under construction so there's a bit of dust and the smell of fresh paint and sanded stone. Only the cafe was open, so wasn't able to try any other restaurant yet. Was a bit disappointed by the quality of some of the materials used (flooring felt thin and cheap). Housekeeping can do better in cleaning the post-construction residue.

Also, be aware that all the elevators are not functioning so even though only a few floors are occupied it can be a wait. There are no ""sauna/steam/plunge pools"" as advertised - the best the staff could say is ""they are not yet here."" So dont expect that anytime soon if that is important.

The gym was amazing, anyone staying here should try the gym. Too bad the pool is still closed but i reckon it will be as great as the gym

Room-wise, although it was nicely decorated, for luxury hotel, the design was so-so. Since the hotel is new, the smells of paintings, woods can be felt. For me, it is a bit disturbing. Bed and Pillow were excellent though and for the amenities, they provide Loccitane.

The breakfast and lunch were excellent too. I really enjoyed the food there, although perhaps the hotel may want to rotate the food as staying there for 5 days and eating the same thing everyday will definitely get you bored.

Location-wise, the highstreet is just within walking distance. You can spend your time there or stretch your legs further to get to market market or SM Aura.

The room was on the 21st floor and had the view of the pools and the skyline and if you looked hard enough, sea and mountain (I wonder which one?). The beds were very nice--just right, not too soft but not too firm either and loved the profusion of pillows! The bathroom was outfitted with L'Occitane toiletries and what I liked was that the shower area is separate from the tub.
Breakfast at the Highstreet Cafe was really good. Not too overwhelming in choices but complete. The GRAB AND GO cart in front is also a nice touch for those who don't have time to sit and eat there.
Overall I would say I had an excellent stay and exceeded my expectations, would definitely go back!",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Security is tight in this property. Guards check every vehicle entering hotel premises. Luggage pass thru X-ray machine. Security personnel are courteous & professional with their job. It has a huge & elegant lobby. There's one thing that AMAZED me is the beautiful lobby chandelier imported from the Czech Republic. A quick look at the High Street Lounge , I was greeted & welcomed by Corrine. There is also a dome shaped chandelier. It has a spacious lobby lounge for dining or to have a meeting in a quiet environment. Check in was fast & quick by Jill. I availed the discounted rate exclusively for BDO Platinum card holders. Hotel suite 2520 was ready at 11 am. Hotel has 8 spacious elevators. Front office supervisor Mr Russ personally brought the welcome fruit platter to my suite. It has a large king sized bed with fresh duvets & pillows. The luggage compartment is cushioned & it wont scratch your precious luggage. Large flat screen TV that offers many FULL HD Channels & a VERY strong internet connection. Bathroom has separate bathtub & shower with rainfall shower head. L'Occitane toiletries are provided. Minor issues are no bidet & weighing scale in bathroom.
Breakfast was great! I was offered coffee by Essa. High Street Cafe has plenty of buffet stations. They have a good selection of food. Chef Ronnie recommended to me the Singapore/malaysian fusion food like Laksa & herbal Bah Kuh soup are served during breakfast. The ice cream station has 12 flavors of gelato ice cream for you to choose. They also serve fresh coconut juice with shell. Freshly cooked bacon. No other hotel can offer this kind of breakfast. Only at High Street Cafe!
On my way to the pool, I met Deejay & he accompanied me to the pool since I was not familiar with the place. Kerry Sport gym instructor Jaime & staff Ara greeted me & were ready to assist me when I use the gym. This is the largest hotel gym I've been & is open 24 hours a day. It has an indoor basketball court & 2 tennis courts outside the gym. It has 2 floors of modern gym equipment.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
First time here. Super friendly staff. Super clean. Not even a leaf on the floor. But the restaurants aren't all opened yet. But there's plenty nearby. I slept during the day so I advised the staff and they put me in a remote part of the building. They have the most impressive gym. Kerry Sports. Best equipment I've seen in any gym. With a matching staff. Not one dust bunny on the ground. I'm definitely returning back! And highly recommend this hotel,Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"This hotel offered intro rates during its first month of operations, April, 2016.
My family took two rooms, one a regular twin and for our son's family, a Premiere Suite.
Our regular room was well appointed and has good amenities but they don't offer turn down service yet. We went out for dinner and returned expecting a turned down bed with fresh towels. Maybe too much to ask for a newly opened hotel. But for a Shangrila?
We expected a lot more.
The Premiere Suite is well worth the upcharge. The extra sitting room with a large flat TV and the well appointed room was most pleasant.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Value for money

"I was invited to an event in the ballroom which went ok but the bad part of my experience started after the event. It was a big event and almost all the guests were leaving at the same time. There was a long queue to pay for the parking fee. The line was moving slowly and although they had a second cashier in the lobby, it was a really painful process to line up because each transaction took a long time. The event was about 5 hours so the parking fee was about 300-400 pesos which is obscenely high. The second part of the ordeal is lining up again to get to the elevators going to the basement parking in Level 4. I also couldn't understand why they did not open the upper levels and had to let their guests go down to the bowels of the hotel. The 3rd and the worst part of the experience was waiting almost 30-45 minutes going from level 4 to the exit. Imagine not moving for 30 minutes in the bowels of the hotel and inching your way up 4 levels to the exit. Good thing there was cell phone signal and I called the front desk and demanded the duty manager to manage the situation. No apologies given at the exit and that was it. Clearly this hotel is not geared towards handling big crowds . Be careful and re-consider if you are thinking of staying in this hotel.",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Over the past weeks I stayed in this new Shangri-La two times. Let me start by saying that I am a long time fan of this wonderful chain and will remain a fan no matter what. I have been looking forward to the opening of this new venue for quite a while and now that that moment has come I am not so happy as I would have hoped. Staff is as always incredibly friendly and service oriented. However, over breakfast they are too present with too many. It loses its subtlety. Teamwork must be stepped up. One asks me what I'd like to drink. Then another one. Still, it takes 15 minutes for the drink to arrive. The food - and that is what you come for - is beautiful. Options are plenty and the buffet looks impressive.
The rooms are bright and spacious. Beds and pillows perfect. Finishing in rooms and bathrooms can be better. Cracks in the paint, leaking shower doors and drawers that don't work are not what Shangri-La is famous for. Furthermore, the aircon in the lifts wasn't working well yet.
No matter what, I will be back to enjoy the homecoming smell of Shangri-La. Just hope that when time goes by, all details will be worked on and Shangri-La at the Fort will be as perfect as its sister hotels.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"This will be a great hotel one day, that I am sure of. So I will happily write another review when the time comes. But for now - don't go there (you can go to Shangri-la Mercati if you want to stay within the group).
The Hotel is simply not ready yet. Yes, they call it ""soft opening phase"", but this is only a nice word for
- Living on a construction site (expect drilling and hammering from 7:30 am to 8pm, more construction workers than guests on the floors, all related noise and just a very strange feeling)
- Only 2-3 elevators (of 6) in use! So you wait for ages every time you need it
- Pool not open yet
- Spa not open yet
- no hot water in our shower
- only Lobby Bar/ Breakfast restaurant open, all other restaurants not open
- Horizon Club - not open
- Staff not trained yet (Room service has to be called, otherwise you they might do your room, but also maybe not, you order room service breakfast, they tell you it will take 20 minutes, it arrives after 40 min, you order a Cappuccino and get a watery mild coffee out of a heat retaining can - you ask them to bring a real Cappuccino to go right away which takes them another 20 minutes, etc)

The rooms (design is more modern, and colors changed from red tones to blue tones) are very nice, so I will come back - but not this year.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"I stayed here in early May, and it seems the hotel is just two months old. Hallways still smell like paint. Room service is very very slow and really expensive, but quality of food is good. Most restaurants not yet open. They need to do more corporate accounts to have bfast included in room charge, esp at the v expensive room rates they charge. At least free wifi, but it went down for two hours of maintenance during my stay. Check in and out is good and friendly. Rooms are new and well appointed. Hotel is in a good area near green ""spine"" of bcg area for shops and restaurants that continue for several blocks.",Value for money:Food:Staff
"The property is fairly new considering it just opened its doors last March. We are anticipating for its opening since the news of a new Shangri-la being constructed in the Bonifacio Global City. It is conveniently located near Bonifacio High Street and Fort Strip as well as to the Mind Museum and a short drive to SM Aura Premiere. There are also shops within the complex but are still currently closed.

The hotel itself is very comparable to Shangri-la Tokyo in such that the hotel level is located on the middle to upper floors of the building. With that said, I had very much high expectation of this property comparing it to its Tokyo cousin. The hotel didn't disappoint probably for some minor glitches that i believe can be fixed as the hotel operations becomes normal.

Check in was a breeze and we were escorted to the elevator heading to the rooms. We were given a High Street View on the 24th floor overlooking the Bonifacio High Street and Laguna Lake. We can also see airplanes taking off from our room. The room is spacious good for a family with 2 small kids like ours. The interior feels more modern compared to the other 2 properties in Manila (though EDSA Shangri-La recently had a major renovation). The bathroom has a tub and a separate shower but I was looking for a bidet spray in the water closet which is not available in this property. Another downside is that, Shangri-la at the Fort being a premiere property, I was expecting there will be a Nespresso Coffee machine in every room (comparing to Shangri-la Tokyo).

Within this property, they have the Kerry Sports Center. They have a 2 level gym, 2 squash courts, 2 tennis courts a basketball court and in the mean time all hotel guest are using the sport centre pool. There is also an Adventure Zone like the one they have in Shangri-la Mactan and Boracay for the kids and kids at heart to play.

I am very much happy to see the staff doing all they can to accommodate the request of their guest. At one instance my son got a cut on his foot after swimming, the lifeguard immediately went in to get his first aid kit and cleaned the wound and placed a plaster on it. Another incident also happened while playing in the Adventure Zone, a small child accidentally slipped while going up the stairs, she hit her mouth hard and it started to bleed, the attendants there were very quick to call medic to attend to the child's injury.

Breakfast at High Street Cafe was just ok, there are plenty of choices but I am very happy with the yogurt they are serving with fresh fruits. The soup section also have plenty of choices such as Laksa, Ba Kut Teh and Taiwanese Beef noodles and of course Filipino favourites such as the Longanisa and dried fish though I was also looking for the Tapa or Tocino and adobo as part of the choices.

Overal, I am very happy to have stayed in Shangri-la at the Fort as it is so convenient to move around with shops and restaurants that are walking distance. Looking forward to stay again in this property in some future time",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"My friends and I had dinner last Wednesday and after deliberating on whether to go ala-carte or buffet, we all dove for the buffet. It was a good decision because the dishes for all the stations were really delicioso.

The seafood section had rock lobsters, shrimps, clams and mussels (no oysters though) with all sorts of dipping sauces. The fruits were fresh and in bite-size cuts while the salad section had all sorts - from caesar to make your own to ready-made ones in jars. Off to the sashimi/sushi section - fresh tuna slices sitting on a whole tuna fish, cold soba noodles and fresh salmon (that was melt in the mouth but which they served in 4-5 slices at a time). There was the cheese, bread and deli section - not as much or as grand as the Spiral Cheese section but acceptable. The other stations served hot/warm dishes - I could not eat as much by this time so I only got what I truly liked - a small portion of the braised beef cheeks, peking duck in flour tortillas and plum sauce and 1 small but thick slice of the grilled wagyu beef then back to the salmon sashimi. I ended my meal with a serving of pistachio and strawberry ice cream. I also tried my friend's sorbet - only enjoyed the lemon flavor, the passion fruit and grapefruit flavors had a bitter aftertaste.

The price was P1,900 net. The only downside was that there was no parking validation which meant that we had to pay the parking fee on top of the buffet price. It was P50.00 for 2 hours and an additional P50.00 per hour. Since we lasted for more than 3 hours, I ended up paying P150.00. Oh well....",Food:Value for money
"Stayed just a month after opening. Room was large size with good quality finishings.

We were running an event at the hotel -- onsite conference staff were really helpful & knew their stuff. Equipment is new & worked well.

Service was excellent. Lounge bar was surprisingly good value.

Standout was the breakfast/brunch restaurant - the food stations went on forever & I could have easily spent hours there gorging myself on all the treats, if I was not actively trying to cut down on yummy things. I can only imagine that Sunday brunch would be amazing.

"Stayed here on a weekend for my birthday with my parents.

The Good:
1. Rooms are spacious and well-decorated. The bed is very comfy. Bathroom is spacious. Overabundance of towels and toiletries. Could not ask for anything more as far as the room itself is concerned.
2. The room rate comes with breakfast for two at the High Street Cafe. The breakfast spread is substantial and the layout of the cafe itself is very pleasing, not too constricting unlike say, Circles Cafe in Shang Makati.
3. Guests are allowed to use Kerry Sports gym facilities for free (including the pool until the hotel's own pool is already operational).

Not-so-good
1. There is faint smell of paint in the hallways still. It's not really that much of a bother unless you plan to hang out in the hallways for long periods of time :)
2. For Golden Circle program members, the lounge is not yet open to enjoy :(",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Good new hotel but it took us 2 hours to arrive from airport due to traffic at EDSA. Shangrila should ask help from government to solve this issue.

Look forward to returning.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Shangrila at the Fort is still at its pre-opening stage and is not fully opened. Currently only a few floors are open and has limited options for food including the in-room dining. Although I am sure this would grow up to be a great property but it will take some time and effort to get there. The location is amazing and if you have work in the Bonifacio Global City then this is the place to stay. There are a host of joints around this area and you will also avoid the traffic for going back and forth from Makati.

The hotel is still facing some teething issues which I should highlight, upon landing at the airport it was difficult to locate the shangrila pick up service and the lady was not aware on my arrival till she crosschecked her roster a multiple times. Front desk was also not aware nor prepared for my arrival even though their chauffer was constantly updating them on our arrival, not to mention in room check in was not provided.
The television was not working on arrival and it seems there was some outage in the area which got rectified by evening. They have very limited choices for in-room dining and the staff was not aware what a margarita pizza was, which was surprising.

Nonetheless I hope all this would improve once they fully open, however when I stay in Shangri-la I expect the shangrila experience which seemed lacking. I had provided the same feedback on their post stay survey and received a response soon which was a good thing.

Overall a good property to stay in the Bonifacio/Fort area.",Staff:Food:Location
"Up one checking in, I noticed that the welcome was warm an sincere. The bell hop even apologized for being 3 seconds late in helping me with my bags. The lady bag who inspected my bag courteously asked me if she can close my bag prior to the putting it in the xray machine. :)

Check in was simple buy the room that I booked wasn't readily available. I went up and the place appeared very clean and plush. The room was not grand but I still liked it. 2 things distracted me was that I had to manually go up the tv table to close the big curtains. Hope they shift to automatic /electric curtains soon. And of course , the lack of bidet which I thought was a a norm in almost all premium Asian hotels.

The local dried fruits were a nice touch. Personalized water bottles would have been better instead of viva water bottles.

I loved the location and the amenities were ok but what really made decide to give them a 5 star was the consistent service that I got from them. I was not feeling my best and I never felt judged, alone or unimportant. They attended to all my needs and it appeared genuine and real.

I asked to be transferred rooms and they did without making me feel too maarte. I requested to the stars ( extra duvet, extra fruits and iced water and whatever) just to test if they would eventually break and throw me out but they were very patient and they even found my lost iPad for me.

I called them to commend them and CJ was very accommodating. I asked him to give me the names of all the people who assisted me but I have yet to receive that. Jared (?) Cadenne (?) and some other lady who was very very patient with me when I was choosing moscato versus another drink. I am what people call a difficult client just because I try to push people go be better at their jobs. Eye contact was consistent, kind and genuine smile and they just appeared to like working there :) happy employees are key ;)

My kids loved the active zone but 1100 for a long sleeves too was just a but too much for me so next time bring proper attire for your kids. 600 Pesos unli play was not expensive but I wish the had lower rates for less time because some people might just need less time.

So despite the lack of flowers compared to Shang makati and edsa Shang, and the lack of bidet, electric curtains and tiny bathtub, Shangrila at the Fort had the warmest and best staff that I've encountered in years. I hope that this is not just because you are new ... :)

Thank you Shangrila at the fort ❤️❤️❤️❤️

"So just to be clear: I have been at the new Shangrila in the Fort in the first week of April 2016, when it's still partially under construction. Not all floors have been delivered yet, and some hotel grounds aren't opened yet. Therefore my overall 5 stars were given considering the hotel is still in soft opening stage, I'll review it again later in the year when it'll be fully operational.
Although the hotel is still partially undergoing construction, I was curious to check the service and the new rooms, as I've heard great comments about it.
This is in bullet points my experience
- Arrival and check-in: Once inside the hotel, I approached the front desk and I was almost immediately recognized as a jade member and accompanied to my room at the 24th floor by the gorgeous and attentive Joanne, who facilitated the check-in at my desk.

- rooms layout, design: i
Well, it's a brand new hotel, so the level of details in the rooms is the highest ever found in any hotel in the Philippines. All walls and ceilings are cladded in veneer, giving a warm and luxury feeling.
I appreciated the location of the safe box, which is finally not inside the main closet, but easily accessible nearby the TV (but still beautifully hidden). The windows are large, the bed, the couch and the desk perfectly proportioned for the size of the room.

- bathroom:
The walls are all tiled with white marble. It's beautifully done, and the details have been taken care of. There's a bathtub and a separate shower, with Grohe fixtures completing the experience.
The water pressure and temperature are perfect. The amenities are all branded l'Occitane, which is something the Makati branch should adopt ASAP as the products used there are really inadequate.

- hotel common areas
This is where Shangrila at the fort has surprised me the most. Although some areas aren't opened yet, the space dedicated to that is massive! The fitness center alone is the biggest I've seen in my life and not just in a hotel, but per se. As an athlete and sport enthusiast, I've always dreamed to find a place with such a variety of activities, machines, classes, and possibilities. That alone is a reason why I'll stay again in this hotel in the future

- restaurants
At the moment of my stay there was only the buffet cafe operating, where I had dinner and breakfast. The legacy of Circles in Makati has been beautifully retained and even improved. The quality of the food is amazing, although the variety isn't as expected. Unfortunately, the layout is poorly designed, going around the buffet can be challenging and since this is a brand new hotel, the floor plan could have been done WAY BETTER, especially considering the huge space available.
Overall, I think I still prefer to have my breakfasts at Circles in makati.

- checkout
Fast and professional. The front desk staff made sure I was greeted by the duty manager, which was surprisingly young (maybe too young for such a hotel). It took me just a couple of minutes to complete the transaction, which was smooth and quick.

The only serious complaint I have, but it didn't affect my rating as this was expected, it's about the noise: from 9am to 5pm there's heavy construction going on at many floors, so I wasn't really able to stay inside my room for most part of the day, as the hammering and grinding sounds from above and below were quite intense.
One more comment: the bamboo bikes are a great idea and a lovely addition to the services available for the guests, but they are totally useless if not given with a lock. I wasn't able to park it or leave it anywhere due to the fear of having it stolen. Ascott is giving the same bikes with a lock so they can be parked along high street while having a meal or doing shopping. I recommend Shangrila to do the same, otherwise the bikes will be stolen and the guests will be blamed!

Overall it was a great experience, but am looking forward to come back later in the year when construction will be finished. Meanwhile, the rates per night should be lowered to compensate the hassle of the noise the guests have to deal with. I found the price I've paid very high, considering I couldn't use the room until 5pm and after 9am due to the noise!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"As usual, awesome Hotel. They just opened a few weeks ago so some minor issues are still evident like the paint smell, smooth service coordination and the lap pool is still under renovation.

Hope to be back again and really hoping that all is perfect soon.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I stayed here for the first time this week.
The bones of this brand new hotel show promise although a lot of the surrounding shops etc are not open. Lobby is dramatic if a tad stark and WAY to many staff on hand oddly bit intimidating.
The rooms are nice and modern although did not blow me away. Don't get me wrong very nice very comfortable. The mini bar and amenities in there were a bit poor for the hotel and rate and a boring old kettle instead of a nespresso again a bit cheap.
One bizarre feature is the sort of security people hanging around on each floor. Reminds me of Russia not a good idea.

The first morning at breakfast was Harry Potter school dinners busy and totally unorganised. Spread is amazing but you can see that they have not worked out the process.

The lobby lounge is a very odd affair with so many mixed metaphors in terms of design. Grandma floral curtains, clean modern walls then bright blue shangri-la carpet then some odd Chinese wall mural art and a massive piece of glass roof art which looks like a star wars space ship. It's totally at odd with the lobby and does not feel right. Even my first business guest commented. I'm sure someone has spent a mint and someone's mother had some input but it needs a re think.

There are a number of ladies in red tops and black pants who are impeccable and super well spoken. This is good they are the highlight.

I think one disappointing thing for a new hotel is that they have persisted with the millions of pieces of chit signing paper which hotels and manila love. There is a thing called an iPad. It's been around a while. Please get some and some apps.

I think it will come good but it needs some focus.

"We where in between appointments so we decided to see the new property of Shangri-la in the Fort.
The lobby was spartan like, spacious but lacks the feel of their other properties here in the Philippines.
We went straight to High Street Cafe to have coffee upon entering the cafe the smell of raw fish permeates the whole cafe.
The decor and the ambiance of the cafe is cold for my opinion, we had coconut pancakes and it is all right.
They don't give you a complimentary car pass whether you dine or not. They are still fixing other restaurants inside so give it another month or so",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"The newest addition to the Shangri La property offers a new vibe, younger, and fresher, the contemporary look from the lobby down to the key card pocket simply spells exciting!
The rooms were fabulous, right now they only offer deluxe rooms but you won't be disappointed, the view is just fantastic, sunsets are the best and the you may settle on their bath tubs comfortably while killing time. And oh, their complimentary dried fruits are too die for, yum!
High Street Cafe for breakfast is a must, they have nine stations but what got me hooked was their ice cream station, definite must try would be Davao's Dark Chocolate, Mangga't Suman and Blueberry Cheesecake. But don't stop there, feel free to help yourself with some Taho and that Fresh Buko or request for your own freshly squeezed fruit shakes.
But the highlight of my stay would surely be the Kerry Sports Gym, which boasts an 8,000 sq. work out area will an NBA Grade Full Basketball Court, Spinning Studio, Squash Court, Tennis Court, Pilates Area, Boxing Area, 360 Fitness Area and their own Swimming Pool aside from the Hotel Pool, not to mention the soon to open Pool Side Bar, isn't it exciting?

"I was privileged enough to be one of the first customers at this fine hotel. It's a given that everything in a Shangri-La hotel will be upscale and amazing. This one doesn't disappoint. But what I found to be the best feature of the hotel was the hospitality and service which was better than other Shangri-La's that I have stayed in (granted, I stayed there the first day it was open). I stayed there to celebrate an anniversary with my wife and planed to surprise her by decorating the room into which we checked into.

Benj efficiently issued my room keys and I was pleasantly surprised to find my amenities in the room despite the short lead time between my phone reservation and 12pm arrival,my sincerest thanks to InRoom Dining team for the quick turnaround. I met a friend in the nearby mall for lunch so I rested in my room thereafter. I visited the Health Club to wash off all the rich food I gorged on for lunch. In my entire 4 -day stay, Jason, Erica and Dax were very helpful. Dax even toured me around the 2nd level gym (it's ironic it was the 1st time I visited the 2nd floor all these years as my exercise routine is confined to jogging and dancing). Anj and Raine were equally helpful with my roommate who misplaced her keys on 2 occasions. Our 3 daily breakfast visits at HEAT were great, thanks to the attentive service from Cecille, Bessie, Noel, Lawrence, Ronel, Lincoln and Alvin. My sister roommate was so impressed by the congenial yet professional service levels we were accorded. Even Tina took time to say Hi despite the steady stream of diners. Our Room Attendants Jenny and Nelson always ensured the spic and span condition of our room, I could have slept in the bathroom floor if not for the cold marble floor. It was an awesome and recharging 4-day prelude to my 50th birthday this month (3 weeks later, I went back to HEAT for my birthday lunch where Chef Hazel regaled me with the well-done steak and Chef JB's scrumptious crepe and refreshing halo-halo). I so made the right choice not waiting for my 50th birthday to indulge myself because everyday can be your birthday. My personal affirmation for self-love was complemented by the consistently caring hospitality I experience every time I stay at Edsa Shangri-La. Thank you for repaying my loyalty in the last 10 years with innately convivial service to me.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"We spent a week at the Edsa Shangri La in October 2018. The hotel is immaculate, well situated, safe and offering a level of customer service that is the best we have encountered in our years of travel. I would recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Manila.

This was my second visit (stayed in November of 2017) and quality and service remained consistent. At the time of reserving the room full payment was required. This concerned me the first year I traveled as it was not something I had been asked to do in the past but it is their policy. Communications to and from the hotel prior to arrival were very quick and helpful.

Upon arrival your vehicle goes through security then you go throw a scanner and xray system like an airport but it is very quick. Check in and out went smoothly.

The hotel is beautifully appointed and immaculate throughout including the pool area and grounds. The restaurant food is good but certainly more pricey than if you eat outside the hotel.

The room we were given upon check in smelled strongly of mildew. I spent one night then had to ask to be moved due to my allergies. The request was immediately accommodated and the second room we were given had no issues whatsoever.

We stayed in the Tower Wing Horizon Executive Room. The room was exactly as pictured online with some unexpected features that made the stay enjoyable. Complimentary water was provided daily. Toiletries in the bathroom were nice. Coffee making supplies (instant coffee however) included cups and spoons instead of disposable items. Robes and slippers were provided. The shower area was great with a waterfall style shower option that was both hot and had great water pressure. The bathtub was a deep style with a sloped back and very comfortable. Overall the bathroom was spacious. There was lots of closet space with two double closets as well as a row of drawers and an electronic safe. The desk was a good size and had a section for plugging in USB cords and electrical cords. Inside the desk were helpful items such as a ruler, scissors, tape, hole punch. The electrical outlets in the room are 220 v but all accommodate the north American plugs. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. We appreciated the counter found beneath the television as it provided a lot of space for our items. The black out blinds were great. Overall the hotel was very quiet. We were in room 1310 and in the evening you could here a bit of a bass sound from the nightclub next door but it was minor and did not impact our stay.

The Horizon club in my estimation is worth paying for as the food, drinks, service and exclusive lounge area included in the price is great.

The pool area is relaxing with beach towels available at the chairs. I did not care for the lines that were set up in the pool to facilitate lap swimming but those that were doing laps undoubtedly would have felt differently. Pool side drinks and food are available.

The fitness centre is well appointed, spacious and the equipment in good repair. I appreciated having access to television while on the treadmill. However I did not like the fact that if you wished to use the hot tub you could not do so as a couple. The mens and woman's hot tubs are in their respective changing areas so have to be accessed individually rather than as a couple.

Mega mall is just around the corner from the hotel and you can also visit the mall that is adjoined to the hotel via a skywalk. We exchanged our money at the attached mall. Very reasonably priced food options are available in the mega mall as is alcohol if you wish to purchase some for your stay.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"Had a 12 noon reservation at Heat restaurant, last tuesday for a meeting. Left baguio at 4 am and arrived in Manila at around 11 am. we decided to park at sm megamall and just walk. we entered the driveway leading to edsa shangrila. passed through security and it was breeze, with me emptying my pockets. as i was about to enter the lobby, another security check was implemented. now this is where i was very disappointed. i was a wearing a polo tucked in and raised my hand to be frisked. the guard passed the handheld metal detector and started to touch my front pocket. he stared at me while holding tight to what was inside my pocket and asked ""ano ito"". i brought it out and said cellphone ko yan. he then passed the metal detector between my legs. so i decided to bring out everything out of my pocket just to expedite things, but this guard seems to be unnerved and continued. it was taking awhile considering that i was not entering an airport. i then was about to remove my belt and then he said finally its ok. my point is, guards are frontliners and could have been courteous in doing there thing. i could have been asked, sir, can you please empty your pockets instead of just saying, ano ito?. for a 5 star property, alot is desired from staff at the frontline. i was embarrassed and inconvenienced.. while i understand their security measures and its importance, it could be done in a manner where guests are not offended, embarrassed or inconvenienced. i reported the matter to the duty manager and was entertained and said they will look into the matter. she took my number and said i will be updated. i have not received any until today reason why i decided to write this review.",Staff

We stayed for two nights at the beginning of our vacation. It was everything we hoped for and beyond. We love the rain shower and looked forward to it at the end of a long hot sticky day. However, when we booked another 3 nights just prior to our return flight, it was disappointing as we were looking forward to the rain shower. The room we were assigned did not have the rain shower, just a handheld shower.

"We booked this hotel on our wedding anniversary. It was actually a redemption stay and yet they did not treat us any different. Staff was very accommodating and courteous, and they even gave us small wedding cake and welcome greeting to commemorate the event. There was also complementary parking which is a big plus. Room furnishings are standard for Shangri-la hotels; dimensions are not so big but still quite spacious, and it's clean and tidy which is most important. One of the best experiences we had was the use of the pool--it was huge and beautiful. My son had an excellent time wading through clean waters.

The hotel also has a huge mall with a wide variety of stalls--great for shopping and dining. The mall also has connection to the MRT and bus terminals should you wish to experience commuting in Manila (though I personally do not recommend it--better use Grab). If this isn't enough for you, this hotel is walking distance to the SM Megamall where you can find more shops offering more reasonable prices (as in any shop you want--department store, clothing brands, a variety of restaurants from fastfood to fine dining, barbershops and salon, spas, etc).

Now, our kid gets the same first class service and hospitality. The pool then is now a mini water park that kids and grown-ups enjoy. Their banana bread is a classic. Great food selection at HEAT.

The room was stunning and very spacious but noise was a real problem, I was there for work and was on night shifts and the room above me had a child that liked to run which seemed to go on all day, even the noise from the hall was distracting.

The breakfast buffet is amazing but lunch and dinner were disappointing with a lot of stuff gone when I got there.

In the first week there was a billing error where my colleagues meals were added to my room, I spoke to reception about this on at least 3 separate occasions and they promised to fix it before check out but when I did check out the error was still there and took a while to resolve.

I'd give it a perfect score (for an otherwise uninspiring city...) if it wasn't for my room. 1701. right beside the elevators. Somehow, they beep whenever an elevator goes by (not only when it stops on my floor). So in the morning, it 's a bit like a slot machine in vegas...

UNFORTUNATELY, this is no longer the case of late. For months already, the service plus the food quality at The Lobby Lounge has tremendously deteriorated. Months ago, we ordered a sandwich that was supposed to have bacon but they failed to include in the order. We complained & 2 strips of bacon followed after the sandwich was consumed. Just yesterday, I ordered a Club Sanwich which looked amazingly good on their menu picture. The sandwich that was served looked pitiful like it came from a cafeteria.

"I recently completed an extended business stay at the Shangri-La Manila. I had mostly good experiences with the hotel but would like to share everything in detail. What I liked: the majority of the staff, the food, the fitness area and locker room, the pool, and the proximity to the Shangri-La Plaza mall.

Like every hotel, there are superstars among the staff. I particularly enjoyed one of the waiters who provided excellent service, and I would request him by name. Also, the housekeeping staff (primarily the day shift) was so attentive, friendly, and thoughtful. They made me feel welcome and as though I was at home. The check-in was smooth.

The breakfast buffet was impressive and did not lack for anything in the realm of Asian, Indian, European, or American fare. The quality was consistently good, and this was the same with the room service. I experienced breakfast and dinner via room service, and I dined in HEAT, the pool bar, the lobby bar, and all three restaurants.

The fitness area is outstanding! It is truly the best hotel gym I have ever had the experience of visiting. The equipment is modern and pristine. The sauna, steam room, jacuzzi, and cold plunge were equally appealing. Everything was kept immaculate, and I never had to wait to use any of the weights, stationery bikes, or spa facilities.

The outdoor swimming pool, landscaping, and pool facilities are spectacular. What more can I say?

The access to the Shangri-La Plaza was so convenient. I visited the mall nearly daily. A myriad of restaurants, office supplies, pharmacy, and groceries were just a few walking minutes away.

The downsides--my first room smelled of mold, however the hotel staff quickly corrected the room assignment to a fresher room on a higher floor. The lobby bar service is slow to both receive drink orders and to place a meal order. The service in HEAT is also inconsistent. It varies according to which area you sit, who your server is, and the day of the week. The rooms are a bit dated and could use a refresh.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"Yes, it could have been perfect but it was not...

I went to Heat restaurant they made me wait for 22 minutes, and nobody came to take my order. So I left without eating

I also experienced problems to get a taxi. I had a free morning and decided to go to Intramuros area. It was 7:30 am. I asked for a street taxi but they told me that it was rish hour so they could not get one for me. So i requested for a hotel car.... but they could not get me any for another 3 hours.

"My friend treated me to a long weekend overnight stay last week of August as his post birthday treat to me, I've heard glowing words about Edsa Shangri-La and I personally experienced the delightful attention from practically everyone I had interactions with. I'll mention the hotel personnel who were instrumental in converting me to a diehard patron. Check-in was breezy with Princess who I understand also assisted my friend who arrived ahead of me. She was very congenial yet professional. I also acknowledge Benjie of In Room Dining team for the same convivial demeanor when he brought over my friend's amenities. I had a latext lunch at HEAT for the Sunday Best offering and I was blown away by the cordial attention from Leslie and Elma, due to the very filling well-done steak from Chef Jude, as I requested to Chris, Elma thoughtfully replenished my hot tea to ward off the guilt from those calories. Eileen also was very considerate to offer the mushroom sauce for the steak to enhance the well-done rib eye slice. As it was my first time to have Sunday lunch, I was lucky enough to accede to Chef Kaye's suggestion to try the crispy pork skin from the lechon and Boy, it was worth the calories. Ronelson and Jhoemar also urged me to try the scallop dimsum (the last time I ate this was when I was in HK with my roommate) and the Peking duck, which made me reminisce our foodie advebtures in HK and Singapore. Chris also proactively gave me a steak knife to help with the rib-eye steak.
Dessert selection was akin to Sugar Paradiso and Chef Wilbert was very helpful to walk me through the lavish spread. I settled for the Banofee Pie and Cream Mango cake slices. After resting in our room and attending the Sunday eve mass, we went back to HEAT for a night cap and I was likewise impressed by the same charming service from Lawrence, Capt. Mike, JR and Arcie, I almost felt like a famous celebrity. They were all attentive and affable at the same time. Being a long weekend, we decided a late Breakfast visit to taper off the crowd and we were pleasantly surprised to be assisted by Tina despite the still busy scenario even at 9:30am. Pinky was very helpful with our low-sugar cappuccino requests for our caffeine fix (anti-guilt for all those chocolate muffins and croissants we devoured), DJ sent us our papaya slices and Cecile for our tomato juice requests as our Vitamin C source. We thought we were full until Chef JB recommended ( and we're more than willing to give on) the Bread pudding as we made room for our tummies as we'll visit the Health Club later to work off those indulgent treats. After the very filling breakfast, we went back to our room and were thrilled to see our room spanking clean, I swear I could eat at the bathroom, thank you Rudy and Benjamin, our Room Attendants. We visited the Health Club to sweat off those calories but we decided to just take the Wet and Dryou Saunas, Lobby was very helpful and also Mac who assisted my friend when his locker key didn't work. We missed Dax who was very welcoming in our previous visits. Last minute shop for chocolates led me to the Bakeshop where Priscilla warmay attended to us. Check-out was also speedy thanks to Joseph who walked us through the room charges.
It was a delightful getaway for my post birthday celebration, thanks to my good friend and the equally pleasing interactions with all these team members, now I fully understand why my friend chose to celebrate here at Edsa Shangri-La.

"We spent two nights in Edsa Shangri-La where we spent an enjoyable weekend. The kids had a fantastic time at their mini water park, which I think is the main attraction of this hotel for families with young kids like us.

Our room was ok in terms of size, smaller than Makati Shangri-La rooms though. But it was clean and the fit out & furniture were pretty new as the Tower Wing just got recently refurbished.

The location of the hotel is perfect! It has foot bridge access to the Shangri-La Mall and is very close to other commercial centers, too.

The staff were all polite and service oriented -- a hallmark of Shangri-La Hotel.

Breakfast selection was also enjoyable, and the weekend was made extra fun because of the roving magician who was there throughout the whole morning to entertain the kids.

Two points we were unhappy with:
1. I requested in advance for NO duck feather pillows but it seems my request was misunderstood. My husband had an asthma attack while we were in the hotel, and barely had any sleep during the first night. To be fair, the beddings were changed the next day, and we were allowed late check-out until 3:00 pm to compensate.
2. We had to pay for valet service. For a luxury hotel, this was something we did not expect as paying guests.

"We were celebrating our 6th anniversary in EDSA Shangri-la. It was also oue first time staying in the hotel.

As soon as we entered, the staff at the lobby were already very attentive to our needs. We were guided towards check-in with a smile.

During our check-in, we were shown exceptional service by the person assisting us. Unfortunately, I could not remember his name. He was very friendly and ensured we had the best stay possible. He even remembered us and offered to take our picture when we were roaming the hotel the following days.

Our room was at the Garden Wing. The rooms are very nice but you can see that they are older compared to the other newly refurbished wing.

On our first day for breakfast, we accidentally slept in and missed the time for our breakfast buffet (inclusive in our room). I called the front desk to ask what we could do. They were kind enough to still let us have the food left, mainly bread. They also offered coffee or drinks, as usual. We greatly appreciated it.

When we were out of the hotel, I got a call and message informing me that the elevators to our wing will undergo a quick maintenance. They kindly informed me that it would be ready at this time. We appreciated the gesture since it helped us avoid any inconvenience.

The hotel amenities itself was also very good. Staying in the pool made me forget we were in the middle of the city. It looked just like a resort!

Over all, our stay was excellent. Expecially because of the exceptional service provided by all the staff. It really made our anniversary extra special.",Staff:Food

"I booked an overnight stay to comfort a friend who lost his sister 2 months ago. It took some time to match our available schedule and when a window for a good date popped up, I approached Raine of Front Desk who was real helpful even if I only reserved a day before, (it was virtually Sat morning after I had a late night dinner at HEAT where Capt. Mike, Lawrence, Mayra and Arcie graciously attended to my dining needs). Check-in was a breeze with Iris who gave us a Garden Wing Room with a view of the pool (also thanks to Front Office Manager Noli for accomodating my request), My friend was very pleased with the room assignment and he shared that he also admired the courteous manner Iris handled the checkout of the 2 hotel guests before us (we gave way to them as we were not in a hurry), Iris was congenial yet professional. I lunched at HEAT for a late afternoon bite where Eileen, Michelle and Cecile were equally attentive to my needs. I caught up with my friend's stories and he was thankful for this ""wellness break"" after settling the affairs of his late sister. After a restful night of sleep, we went down to HEAT and Glaiza was kind enough to seat us again with a pool view. Pinky thoughtfully served us with fresh mango slices for a healthy start. I also acknowledge the very welcoming gesture from Tina who visited our table to say hi and offer any assistance we may need. I forgot the name of the lanky Chef who gave us ripe papaya slices for our Vitamin C fix. Chef JB read my mind when he offered us the bread and butter pudding which I always partake in my previous visits. Chef Wilbert was equally considerate when we asked for a 2nd serving of the pancakes, we finished off the filling breakfast with cappuccino from Ronnel who also accommodated my diabetic friend's request for a less sweet serving. Check-out was also speedy courtesy of Princess able assistance. The innately nurturing attention from these team members affirm my annual effort to sustain my Jade GC status since 2008. Thank you for helping me heal my friend in this challenging situation. I look forward to the same consistent habit forming service when I treat my lady best friend for her post birthday celebration.",Staff:Food

You enjoy the privacy of having access to the its own lounge and skip the long breakfast queue as the lounge serves breakfast. Also serves afternoon snacks and drinks. What has changed with this visit is that it now has a dedicated kiddie area near HEAT where the smaller kids can enjoy a small area and supervised activities. Also my kids like the pool area as there is a small slide and playground.

What I like about this hotel is their themed buffet during weekends, lobsters on a Friday, wagyu on Saturdays and a market theme on Sundays",Food:Comfort & Facilities

They also had gelato and I loved their Pandan and Ube flavors. The service was good and their platters were quickly refilled.",Food:Location

Loved the attention to detail and friendly service. Housekeeping even leave you a personalized note when they do the turning in.,Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Hotel and pool are grea, and no complaints with the room, I’d recommend. Stayed a few times and each time have the same issues. Hotel won’t listen that all expenses go back to my company, and plead ignorance when discussing.

I had email confirming all charges are covered by company but they refused to accept. In the end I had Capita contact them directly, and they offered a refund but then refused to give me this, after incorrectly charging,

Waiting staff in the lobby are only interested in selling drinks and not customers, often refusing tables and reserving them for guests who spend certain amounts, or you cannot get a table.

Most restaurants are ok, although Japanese portions sizes are very small. The Paparazzi (Italian) was really tasty when you can get in. We tried getting a table for three at 6pm but was refused as they were fully booked. By the time we left the Japanese restaurant (opposite) there was still only two tables being used, so not very impressed! (To be fair, they did say they were expecting a large party, but they’d not turned up and they lost out).

Otherwise staff very friendly, and always polite, which is the Philippino culture. Planning on travelling frequently to this part of the world for work, with any colleagues but seriously unsure if I can deal with the hassle you get with this place.

It’s not hassle free, and despite 99% of people being great, some Managers are rude, and the whole place needs a good review of how it serves customers. For the price, it’s very expensive for a mediocre service.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Hotel staff was nice and courteous. Near Shangrila plaza mall and next to SM megamall.
Free wi fi and free parking. Lots of security guard. Before you enter the hotel there's an x-ray machine and metal detector. Overall , it's a very nice and safe hotel.",Location
"Check in was quick (we were early). Receptionist was polite and all smiles.

Room was big enough and well-cleaned. Bathroom was also big enough and clean. Not a fan of the built-in bidet though (it can cause UTI in females).

The housekeeping was very prompt. Our kid got sick and vomited on the bed, and the housekeeping staff came quickly and changed sheets.
Our kid vomited again, and the second time, the housekeeping staff saw our kid actually vomiting in the restroom and offered to call for a nurse. Nurse came in quickly and promptly (we called on her twice: the first time was for vomiting, the second time was at about 130am because we ran out of paracetamol. — thanks for the promptness).

The playplace (I forgot what it’s called: Cubs and..) staff were very friendly and enthusiastic and behaved like teachers :) Our daughter had fun. Also, the place was well-kept and cleaned. Had fun attending the “eco tour” and feeding the fish :)

Heat was a good breakfast buffet. Wide selection. Love the taho! Again, wait staff were very friendly, prompt.

Check out was also quick and efficient. We loved that the wifi was free in the entire hotel, and that local outside calls were free of charge.

Parking was ample.
Was not able to use the pool but saw that it was clean, and the kiddie part was big :)

Downside: the key cards malfunctioned several times and had to go down repeatedly to the lobby to have them reset. Not really bad, though.

Was there for a business meeting. Family had fun (I worked haha).

Good, family-friendly hotel :)",Staff:Food:Cleanliness
"I was truly satisfied by Shangri-la's services and facilities. However, I asked to have a pool-view room, and through the email, the hotel said my request was duly noted. But what I had was parking-lot view room. I had to pay another 1000PHP excl tax per night to have a pool view room. I thought I could have a view that I requested, since they said duly noted. I hope they won't respond like this if they can't assure the view.

The breakfast was not amazing as much as I expected. Many people said the HEAT was the best breakfast buffet as they had experience, but for me, it was just a buffet.

가기전에 가든윙 Pool View로 요청을 했고, 호텔 쪽에서는 Duly Noted되었다는 응답을 이메일로 직접 받았습니다. 그래서 따로 풀뷰 객식을 예약 안했구요. 그런데 갔더니 풀뷰가 없다고 하네요; 주차장 뷰였어요... 뷰에 너무너무 실망을 해서 그럼 어떡하냐 했더니 저보고 1000PHP를 추가로 내고 룸을 업그레이드 하라고 하더군요.

It felt like I was in a resort sans the beach. My toddler enjoyed playing in the pool. My family was also able to use the gym and sauna area, which they enjoyed. Breakfast selection at The Heat was great! Though I would recommend changing suppliers for the longganisa and beef sausage. But the food selection with fresh juices, coffee were exceptional.

"This is to bring to your notice that I am extremely disappointed with the service I received when I went to the hotel lobby bar. My family and myself have been staying in your hotel since years but never received such bad service. I just had a long haul - 22hrs trip. I went to the hotel for a business meeting, seated myself in the lobby bar, I wasn't greeted. No menu was offered, no water. I was sitting for almost an hour..waiting. What I can't believe, staff put and sit a kid beside me not even asking if it's okay with me. After almost an hour, I politely ask the lady if she could give me food menu. Unfortunately, she just said ""ok but didn't return. I wasn't sure if this a self service restaurant or what. But I'm pretty sure this is a 5 star hotel.The people that was seating beside who arrived after me was only seconds but they were served first. I guess she forgotten me. I have to ask another lady for menu. Few minutes browsing, the ipad got battery empty. My client arrived with no food and drinks in the table. I hope you don't forget the basic service and standard procedure. Overall staff in the front desk were able to assist my needs, very quick to help.

There is a typhoon in the city and I wasnt allowed entry from the east side, I was made to walk around a few hundred meters, drenched in rain, to another entrance. I understand the policy is fit for automobiles.But for individuals?! That is insane! I complained to the front desk, only to get an explanation of “policy”. Damn that policy. You have security guards at both entrances, and another security check at the main lobby. It is plain inconsiderate and downright rude to refuse entry of a guest. 1) there is a sidewalk 2) it wasnt like that before 3) ongoing typhoon with the city in a state of emergency, orange warning status, (why even MMDA who has a number coding policy, lifted theirs) 4) security personnel were manning both entrances. To add insult to injury, exit was the same. You could not reason out security. Even cars were allowed exit, why wont you allow exit for pedestrians? I am so furious with your customer service!",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"As always, the accommodation and service was top notch and could not be beat.

Quite disappointed though to find out that valet parking now has a flat rate of Php150 even for checked-in guests. Borrowing a plate and a bowl would also cost Php150. Such a dismay for a 5-Star hotel as I only see these strategies on lower service-level/class hotels. Really unclassy and I feel that the hotel should be embarrassed to be doing this.

The Horizon Club lounge was great, the selection of food and beverage was ample and the staff were courteous. Would be a good place to hold meetings though I would suggest reserving ahead of time as it does get full especially during the 5pm to 6pm cocktail time.

The kids play area with scheduled activities is a pleasant addition and firmly adds to ESL's reputation of being a family hotel. The pool has always been a great come-on with ample activities for kids and adults alike. I think ESL has the best pool for kids among other hotels in Manila.

Breakfast still sucks and is highly overpriced. Food selection is so-so and runs out quite fast - again, something which I would expect from a lower class hotel but not from a 5-star hotel charging close to Php2,000 for breakfast.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities

"We stopped by for a weekend checkin and had a great time.
Joseph from check in was incredibly professional and anticipated our needs. He asked if we preferred separate doubles or a king, and let us choose between a larger tub or shower so that our child could opt for a nice soak.
Rooms were sized well, the view to the pool was nice. We were very comfortable.
The highlight was our lunch and dinner at the Summer Palace. Having travelled most of asia all year, I can honestly say that this was the best in house restaurant I have been to.
We have become wary of the buffets (Not a lot of choice in type of cuisine, often only average quality food, not a lot of control over what we eat -- a LOT of food does not make it better) and wanted a good meal that we could relax with.
Based on reviews, we chose to go to Summer Palace where we met with restaurant director Nancy Farm. She gave us excellent menu suggestions, charmed our 5 year old son, and we watched her coordinate like a well oiled machine with her hard working staff. She walked to tables, introduced herself and ensured everyone had a great time.
Our dinner that evening was exceptional. She introduced us to a SINFUL fried rice (mind blown) and a steamed malaysian fish -- so succulent and fresh that the meat was almost otherworldly. The meal we had was perfect-- well thought out, delicious, and healthy (for my husbands health / dietary concerns it was better than any buffet spread).
This restaurant is a must try for anyone who loves food and wants quality with their value.

Well done.",Food:Staff
"We stayed here at the beginning and end of our trip. Our first stay, we had standard rooms but our second stay we decided to upgrade to suites. Both were fantastic, but the suite was phenomenal! Staying in a suite you can get complimentary laundry and shoe shine services, and you also have 24-hour access to a lounge that serves breakfast, high tea, and cocktails. You also get more amenities provided in your bathroom, and get l'Occitane products instead of the generic products offered in standard rooms. No detail is overlooked in the incredibly spacious suites. The slippers were even more plush in the suite!

The hotel itself is wonderful. The lobby is open 24 hours, and serves great food and drinks in an elegant setting. There are beautiful pools in the courtyard, creating an""urban oasis"" vibe. The breakfast and dinner buffets at HEAT had a huge range of delicious options, from Filipino to Western. It's also conveniently connected to a mall.

The spa was one of the nicest I've ever visited. You get an entire private room to yourself, complete with a bathroom equipped with full amenities and a steam shower.

Overall, would highly recommend this beautiful hotel if you're visiting Manila!",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Not quite what I would expect for a 5* hotel. The rooms are tired and dated and lack amenities, poor coffee (Nescafé sachets) in the rooms and an empty mini bar. Breakfast is chaotic and characterised by piles of used crockery and dirty tables - perhaps it’s just the weekend and exceptionally busy. If you are looking for a calm relaxed breakfast - keep looking.

The staff are all polite and welcoming and the pool area is a saving grace as it is lovely.

"On a recent trip to Manila we decided to stay at the Shangri-La Hotel, where we had stayed on a previous visit. Last time we went to Manila we stayed at a different hotel but wanted to return to this one for a variety of reasons.
We were not disappointed. In fact, we were again thrilled with the experience.

From the moment you enter the grounds and pass through two security checks, the environment is civilized and efficient. All luggage is passed through a security screening and you have to pass through a metal detector but that is a minor inconvenience to insure safety. I did have to relinquish my pocket knife which I always carry on trips (usually enclosed in my luggage). I retrieved it upon check out.

The rooms are beautifully appointed and the rain forest shower is the best hotel shower experience you can imagine. Fresh towels, excellent room service, wonderful food and a polite and hospitable staff make this one of the best hotels I have ever experienced (and I have traveled internationally a lot).

We ate at the hotel a couple of times including the Italian restaurant (Paparazzi) and the Japanese sushi restaurant also on site. The food was excellent although we found the service lacking in both restaurants.

The grounds around the hotel are incredible considering the location in a densely populated urban area. We did find an hour to sit by the pool although the afternoon sun was blocked by the high rise buildings near the hotel.

We booked a car through the hotel for the trip to the airport and everything worked extremely efficiently. Pricing for most meals and services is moderate considering the high quality of the establishment and the services.

We also took advantage of the spa on our last night and had a couples massage. It was out of this world. Highly recommend the spa and its very professional staff.

We highly recommend this property and will stay here again when we return to Manila.",Food:Staff:Location

This happens even at night, even after midnight. It was my first time alone too so I was scared and the noises didn’t really help. Took a nap today but even that I couldn’t make without my heart raising when the noises just keep on going. Two nights now. The linens are not fresh either.

"Location in the business district actually takes one away from the hustle and traffic of central Manila. Large high end shopping mall attached to the hotel. Only downside is that it is far from the tourist sites like Intramurous, but with Grab, it is less of a lucky draw not to get fleeced by the local taxis.

Rooms are nice and spacious befitting the Shangri-La brand, excellent gym with enough modern treadmills and free weights (sadly underutilized by her guests). Nice pool with happy hour. The buffet breakfast is at HEAT and gets crowded if you go late, at night the dinner has an excellent Asian - Western selection and don't miss the DIY Halo-Halo.

It felt safe to walk about (had a bad experience at Makati area during daylight hours from street urchins few years back) even at night to get a drink nearby.

Its great for a business meeting but if you are a tourist ... it is a bit far from the usual spots and would need to cut across town for those things unless you plan to travel out anyway.",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities

Smaller rooms, no ATM and a more modest lobby are the biggest differences between the sister sites. Billed as an ‘urban oasis’ this location has an amazing pool area and is very convenient as a shopping excursion base-camp for more recreational minded guests. Both locations share a high commitment to service and provide excellent food offerings.",Location:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Still with the friendly staff.

Stayed in the TOWER WING with 2 double beds. The rooms are well kept and clean, has enough room to move around. The bathroom is big enough and clean, no water marks on the sink and neither are there molds on the corners. The water temperature is easy to set.

FREE INTERNET! No difficult log ins, no need for usernames and passwords. Speed was ok enough for video streaming, although the WIFI connections disappeared at around 12MN together with the cable.

Speaking of cable TV. It's the only disappointing part. Considering it's a SHANGRI-LA, the shows are mostly STANDARD DEFINITION. I do hope that they eventually upgrade the resolution of their shows to HD at the very least.

Valet service is available at a flat rate of Php150.00 for checked-in guests.

The pool is clean.

The breakfast at the HEAT has a good variety of choices.

OVERALL I will always recommend Shangri-la EDSA as a place to stay in, although the location is starting to be difficult to reach being in ORTIGAS. But it's never boring because there are two great malls on either side.",Comfort & Facilities:Internet
"It would be better if during the check in process the front desk will explain everything to you such as the amenities and activities that are complimentary during your stay. It is also nice if someone will assist you to your room and explain briefly about the room amenities. I've been to Raffles and I was expecting the same service since both are luxury hotels. If I didn't ask about the activities, I wouldn't be included on the scheduled fitness class. When I got up to the room, I have to open every drawer just to find the room amenities. I gave a 3 star rating because of the wonderful service provided from the health club and chi spa. Otherwise, I'd rate it with 2 stars.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

When the front desk Kevin knew that it was my bday, offered a good deal of meals and late check out with a minimum fee, although I politely decline since we have to leave next day early too and had dinner plans already.

"I have stayed at this hotel many times over the past years and still generally enjoy the facility. The pool and fitness center are great and the breakfast is very good as long as one can include that in one's rate. The rooms are not large and mine was a bit musty this time, but not horrible. However, on this visit management put in an overzealous security procedure. They will only allow people to enter OR exit from one driveway to the main entrance. For pedestrians, this triples the distance to the main road, where one would catch a taxi or return from the mall. In this hot and rainy season this is a significant inconvenience and seems add little to security. They have also placed a second x-ray check for pedestrians at the mouth of the entrance of the drive way, further adding to inconvenience without any clear value to security. Compounding the problem is the rude attitude of the young men who can barely speak English who man these ""check points."" One feels more like a prisoner than a guest.
Thus I have given the hotel a lower rating that I would have otherwise. This system is inappropriate. I have worked in security for decades and this process adds nothing to security but surely angers guests. Some common sense is needed.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Checked in for a stress-free weekend, and it did just that! Although the staffs are a bit snobbish and pretentious, especially the waitresses at the lounge and bar.

"Pros:

+ Great location for SM Megamall (lots of eating options there, including Din Tai Fung, Tim Ho Wan and Ipuddo

+ Great family pool (better than Shangri-La at the Fort that I also stayed at)

+ Good security (not that I was worried in the first place)

Negatives

- Rooms extremely dated, and actually a little disappointing. Certainly not what I expected for a ""5*"" hotel. Shangri-La at the Fort was a lot more modern.

- Restaurants quite expensive. I ended up mostly eating at SM Megamall instead.

- Could have been more generous with the complimentary water and toiletries.

Overall, I would stay at this hotel again. If I was on business, would stay at Shangri-La at the Fort. If I was with my family, I would stay here at the EDSA Shangri-La, as the pool area is a lot more child-friendly and family orientated.

The gym is exceptionally good and has all amenities including Jacuzzi, steam and sauna.
My overall experience at this hotel was fantastic. It gives a free wifi and quick service too.
It has a fancy mall right below with all high end brands.

"We stayed at the Shangri-la Edsa as part of our honeymoon in the Philippines.

Great service all round really, they lost our booking for about 30mins while we were checking in which caused some panic as they said they were fully booked. All resolved they managed to find it and a room.

Great location close and air bridged to the shopping centre.

One downside is transport from. We tried to organsie with the front desk on the day we were set to leave and it was a nightmare we had to hire a car in the end from Avis, for more than 3 times the amount that it cost a taxi to get there...so I'd recommend pre booking something else.

We missed our free grande breakfast because the restaurant was too busy with a medical conference. They did warn when we checked in but still not ideal.

Room was great and security is high. I feel their main market is rich Filipinos- hence the offer of a limo to the airport.

Great place it just has some pitfalls",Staff:Value for money:Food
"I stayed here on business for 3 weeks. The hotel lives up to its 5-star rating. Service is excellent, good security, and the premier room in the tower wing looks even better than in the picture featured on the hotel website. It's clean and spacious with a king-size bed, couch, desk, TV, plenty of storage, and shower stall and separate bathtub. There's a good breakfast selection in the morning (Western, Indian, Filipino, pastries, breads, jams, cereals, even ice cream and sushi) although it rarely changes so after the first week it starts to get somewhat old.

The best part of the hotel is that long-term stays get a choice between a car & driver to take you to/from the office everyday, OR complimentary breakfast and laundry service. I chose the latter, and was pleased to find dry cleaning was also included. Also, the hotel will organize an event once a month for long-term stays such as pizza & beer nights, movie nights, etc.

The hotel is connected to the Shangri-La Plaza Mall. It's also a 10 minute walk from SM Light Mall, which is even larger with an ice skating rink, bowling alley, movie theater, more restaurants, etc.

Other amenities: nice pool with a water slide for kids (no adults allowed on the slide), decent spa although a bit overpriced for what you get (I do not recommend the luxury hammam treatment which ended up being over $100 for what was essentially a basic body scrub),

Some minor issues: The breakfast gets crowded between 8-9am. Although I've never waited in line longer than 10 minutes, I usually get seated at one of the tables that have been tightly packed together so that you're nearly rubbing shoulders with people sitting next to you. The hotel has tried to address this by opening up the restaurant at the mezzanine level for breakfast service during busy times.

The room service is sub-par and overpriced -- the three times I ordered food it came lukewarm and tasted bland.

The concierge can order a Grab car for you if you don't have the app, but they only have one tablet they can use. So if it's already being used for another guest, then you'll need to wait until their ride is finished. Why the hotel doesn't just buy several tablets for the concierge to fix this problem is beyond me.

The hotel car service is expensive and not worth it. Use Grab instead if you can.

Conclusion: I would definitely stay in the hotel again if I ever come back to Manila, but would do a few things differently like use Grab more often and avoid room service and the spa.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Most of the guests of this hotel, and those who write reviews of it, seem to be wealthy Filipinos. Being a European, I provide a somewhat different perspective.

I spent eight nights at this hotel in March. I chose it because it is close to a government office where I was doing a project, because it is five star, and because of its outdoor pool and tropical garden. Although I have been many times in diverse tropical countries, I still appreciate a hotel with a piece of tropical nature. EDSA Shangri La did not disappoint me. The pool and garden are not huge but they are nice and well-kept.

Service was excellent, as everywhere else in Southeast Asia. To a European, Filipinos seem almost excessively polite. In Europe it is hard to find a hotel (except perhaps a horribly overpriced one) where somebody will open doors for you and wish you a nice day, but this is the standard in nice hotels in Southeast Asia, including EDSA Shangri La.

I also love Asian food and the selection at breakfast did dot disappoint me: not only Filipino (which is great), but also Japanese, Chinese, and Indian. If you prefer European or US food, they have cheeses, bacon and eggs, croissants, oats, etc. They also have some (not too many) local fruits: pine apple, melon, water melon, sometimes dragon fruit and papaya. If you prefer a short life, there is plenty of fried bacon and sausages, too.

My room was large and nice, with a very comfortable bed.

The location of the hotel is also fine. The neighborhood looks nice. There is an urban train (metro) nearby that takes you downtown. There is an absolutely huge mall with nice restaurants and two large food stores.

Now, a couple of issues. Main issue: If you go to breakfast after 8:00, you may have to wait for 20 minutes, or even longer, to get a table. I have been at four and five star hotels all over the world and I have never seen such long lines outside a breakfast hall. I have read many complaints about this but they do not seem to be doing anything about it. Having to wait for half an hour to be seated is absolutely unacceptable for a five star hotel. I heard that part of the problem comes from the fact that the breakfast restaurant is open to people who are not hotel guests but I have no idea how much that contributes.

Then, come 8:00 AM, the breakfast restaurant gets so tightly packed that you may be assigned to a long table, like in a medieval European castle, where you would literally be rubbing shoulders with your neighbors. Also, navigating around the table and avoiding collisions with other guest becomes a problem. The lines in front of the popular dishes may also be exasperating. In sum, avoid rush hours for breakfast unless you don't mind waiting for a long time.

Even more irritatingly, one Friday night there was very loud music somewhere downstairs that made its way all the way to the fifth floor where I was staying. It went on after midnight. When I complained at reception the next day, they admitted that they had had some kind of party. Again, totally unacceptable for a five-star hotel to have such loud parties going on until so late and being heard five floors up!

I hardly ever consume anything between meals, but other people do, so be warned that everything at this hotel is priced like in a restaurant in central London or Amsterdam, exceeding prices at the nearby mall by at least a factor of two.

Despite these issues, I will be staying again at this hotel, for another eight or nine days, in July, and then perhaps once more in November. I hope some of the issues that I mention here will have been resolved.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"I celebrated Mother’s Day at Shangrila Edsa. My hubby surprised me a staycation and I was excited just at the thought of staying in a luxuriousl hotel. Well, my excitement easily faded when we got there but I never said a word coz I don’t want to hurt hubby’s feeling.

Remarks:

The hotel’s Pool & Lounge area was kind of small considering the number of rooms they have. Pool has nylon rope as division to accommodate those practicing a lap or something...Seriously??? Why on earth they practice in that small Pool where hotel guests should enjoy. If they are Athlete or into competition I suggest to do it in a Big Pool.

Hotel room was a bit ok, though I don’t understand why the two Double beds were almost side by side as in there’s no partition or an aisle between those two beds. Bathroom has no bath tub! For a price we paid I guess we deserved a bit.

Television reception was not good too. Has very few cable channels to choose from. Our home TV has better reception, it is much clearer.

Food was a bit pricey too.

Over all review, disappointing! I’m sorry but We are a frequent at hotels and I guess Shangrila should live to it’s name coz that name has become the basis of your price too. Sad to say Shang needs an upgrade now to be at par from it’s competitor or lower your price to avoid high expectations and disappointments.

I will not reccommend Shang, if you have a budget GO to Solaire and if you are looking for affordable but good you can GO to The Bay leaf (Gen. Trias Cavite & Aquamira Tanza Cavite) you will be surprised to see these two provincial hotels to be that good.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

"We enjoyed every bit of our family staycation in Edsa Shangri-La. The hotel is very accessible and is situated near two adjacent shopping mall, the Shangri-La Plaza and SM Megamall, there is also a connection to the train (MRT). We arrived at past 12 in the afternoon and we're immediately allowed to check-in, kudos to the Front Desk who handles the check-in process efficiently. The hotel rooms were renovated and is definitely a big improvement compared to our previous stay in 2013. The resort type pool area is a big plus for the hotel, my daughter specially enjoyed the water park area. The hotel has a complete line of activities for the kids (like cooking, gardening, feeding the fish, and arts & crafts) to keep them busy while us parents take time to relax in the pool area and enjoy the sunset. Indeed a perfect staycation for us. We will definitely come back:-)",Food:Location:Staff
"We booked this hotel to have a staycation themed as a Netflix Night. We’ve been looking forward to this and planning it. Problem is the smart TV in the room was not functioning. They took half an hour and several
follow up calls before someone showed up—who disn’t understand the problem and thought all we wanted was a new remote. Then after another 20 minutes someone came from housekeeping who also didn’t know how to solve it. After 10 minutes someone from IT came who ended up calling someone from Engineering. They took up more than 2 hours trying to fix it but it wasn’t fixed. Ultimately they blamed the manufacturer. Samsung apparently sold smart tv’s that didn’t function as such.

This is a small deal. But this is the kind of small deal that ruins a weekend and stains a five star reputation.

One can really tell through the rooms that the hotel has been around for many years. The room is average size with the usual amenities of a hotel room. The mini bar was empty though.

"The Edsa Shangri-La is not the newest hotel in Manila and its location isn’t prime, but it offers the perfect place for a staycation with a literal oasis of the swimming pool and trees amongst the hustle and bustle of Ortigas. I have stayed in this hotel more times than I count and have never had a bad experience, although only just got around to reviewing it now.

If you are flying into Manila and are staying at the Edsa Shangri-La then chances are you either know someone in the area or you are coming on business. The hotel is about a 30-minute drive from NAIA airport with no traffic and closer to a 1 hour 30-minute drive with traffic on a rainy Friday night. The hotel is flanked by two malls; the Shangri-La mall that the hotel connects to via walkway, and the SM MegaMall a short 3 minute walk from the hotel lobby. Outside of the two malls there really isn’t a lot in the area with Ortigas being the old business district with most modern businesses and hotels being in the Makati and Manila bay area.

Hotel check-in is usually very swift, I don’t seem to recall a time when I have had to wait more than a minute or two to have my details taken. Of course, the check-in staff process everything very quickly and you will have your room key before you know it.

The hotel reception is very grand, nice and open with large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling with the 24hour hotel bar stretching across the back of the reception building. There are two wings to the hotel but after being refurbished a year or two ago there isn’t too much difference between the rooms.

The rooms themselves are an ok size. Far from the largest that the most recently built Manila hotels are now offering, but certainly not small enough to complain about. Despite the hotel being fairly old the rooms have had a refresh and for the most part are in good condition and don’t look overly tired.

The absolute gem at this hotel for me, and why it is perfect for a staycation, is the pool area. Which in my opinion is the best hotel pool in Manila besides the sprawling Sofitel at the bay. The pool is nice and large with an entirely separate kids pool off to the far side so that those with families don’t bother those without. The pool bar has ample seating and some TVs which makes it perfect to just chill out and have a beer but be warned that they close infuriatingly early at around 10pm on a weekday and 11pm on a weekend. The staff will, thankfully, allow you to order some drinks and sit out after the bar has closed should you wish to chill to the early hours of the morning. The pool bar menu is as you would expect and also offering a selection of pizza’s that are cooked in the oven right there in front of you in the pizza oven. What also makes this pool area feel like a real oasis is the plant life and trees which are so very welcomed in this concrete grey area of town, but that also comes with a lot of mosquitos! Be very sure you bring mosquito repellent with you if you plan to sit outside after dark.

The hotel houses four restaurants excluding the pool bar. Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and the standard hotel buffet restaurant are all present, if memory serves me correctly. As you would well expect from a Shangri-La the service is impeccable and the quality of food no matter your choice of cuisine is high.

Check-out is usually fairly straight forward but be sure to pre-book a hotel car if you are travelling back to the airport as the local taxis don’t come into the hotel lobby too often and even if they do you’d probably not want to take one all that distance.

If they just opened the bar area a little later each evening, then I don’t think I would ever leave.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Pick up service at the airport should be improved. Guests are expected to look for them instead of the other way. Unclear email direction. Instruction directed the guest to meet before gate 4 but they were standing at gate 5. At least good 5-10 mins wasted trying to search for them and waiting for the transport to arrive.

Other than that, Shangri-La never fail to meet my expectations. Check in service was seamless, gym facilities, pool and room are great.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Once you book in this hotel you can just relax. They take care of you like very few can. I have stayed in Edsa Shangril La, Mandaluyong, Metro Manila, Philippines for 70+ days and that, I believe gives me some authority to write this review.

Their check-in process is world class. They will check with you about the timing that the cleaning should be done, the fruits that you like, what time you need the turn down service to how many bottles of water you will need. Since I was long staying guest they even took my picture so that the staff can recognise me. Hence, right from the start when Ria welcomed me I knew I am all set and I looked forward to more.

Dining. Breakfast spread is amazing. Most 5 stars have a good spread but this is exceptional, People like DJ in the Shushi and fruit counter make it all the more great when they remember your fruit choices and keep it ready for you before you arrive. Their Indian food (Hats off the chef Raghu Bansh Singh) is best in the city, I say this after sampling food at 3 New Bombays, Pooja’s café and Royal Indian Curry House. The food is wholesome, hygenic and does not feel heavy as the food in others felt.

Saturday Breakfast are Magician days, the guy is a real pleasure to watch.

Gym: Must try, Sauna, Jacuzzi are world class.

Swimming pool: Clean and fun. The life guards are an alert lot, they insist children to wear a life vest before they enter the pool. Your kids are in safe hands. It is a trpical paradise out there. It can get crowded over the weekends, but you will still get individual attention.

24 hours coffee shop: The temprature is way too cold, so ladies be mentally prepared when you wear off-shoulder dresses. The Singer is melodious but can be tad loud, quite a few times I thought of having the dinner there instead of in the room. The decible limits drove me away. Guess alchohol might muffel the sound but on that I have no authority to comment upon.

Money exchange: The rate is better elsewhere (try Mega mall, or a small shop in Green hills). You can withdraw cash from your international card with a charge if you are not a Golden circle member.

Guest Service: Miguel went out of the way to check with the Manila ocean park if the online bookings needed a print out or not (Note a print out is required, more so if you are a foreigner like me).
Shirley the cleaning lady is amazing not only does she does her work efficiently she also helped me out with the building names when I had to start looking out for apartment for myself. I had casually asked her about the name of a nearby building, she went out on her day off and found out for me. Since she knew it was important to me she left a hand written message in the room instead of waiting to see me the next day. I am sure it is not part of her job description and hence feel special that she thought she can go an extra mile for me (may be I am nice too , but that is another story)!

I also regularly got Silver edition and signature chocolates, loved them.

They let you cuddle their service dogs. It was a treat for me.

I am from HR and obviously had to admire the way staff is hired and trained. They have genuine smiles and genuinely put Guests first. During my stay there was a 51st Annual Asian Development Bank conference happening and about 300 plus dignatories were at the hotel. Even the President of the country was there to address the conclave. It was definetly a fortress but it still maintained a look of calm efficiency.

Mr. Amit Oberoi your team is doing a fab job. On a lighter note, let me know if you have any life time deals for me .

"We had an international event at the Shang recently and we were the lead for the set-up arrangements. I noticed most equipment, furniture and other furnishings were quite dated. There was an instance that we repeatedly requested for decent and stable podium for our speaker. I think if equipment upgrade is not yet in the pipeline at least initiate efforts to retouch or refurnish the furniture. Carpeting was quite old too.

During dinner, food quality, taste and presentation was quite disappointing. One of our prinicipals even commented food is not good and lacked care in preparation.

I hope they would consider reassessment of aspects of events and banquet to ensure meeting clients’ expectations of a 5-star hotel.

Good. They have activities for small kids. My son felt awkward joining them. He was 9 and was big for his age.

Pool
Ok and luckily wasn’t crowded at all. If you are vertically challenged and not a skilled swimmer you’d be stuck in just one area.

Dinner: lobster
If you love lobster it’s great. Considering how expensive lobsters are this is a good deal.

A very helpful employee provided detailed instruction on the boxing machine, allowing us to have a safe and challenging workout. The treadmill was well-maintained, too, and had a TV to entertain you.

From there, we were off to the pool. Towels were quickly brought to our loungers. There were quite a few people in the pool area, but we never felt it was ""crowded"". The only thing we continue to be surprised about is that there are so many flies in the pool area - very irritating!! (Same as we experienced two years ago!) I came equipped with ""Off"" lotion packets, and that seemed to keep them away, but it's quite puzzling...

We had a lovely restful sleep that evening on the incredibly comfortable beds and comfy pillows.

The next morning, we enjoyed the incredible selection at the breakfast buffet. I particularly loved the selections at the sushi station, and the delightful pastries, especially the apple crumble. I enjoyed scrambled eggs to order, and there were many, many, many other choices as well. The brownie cheesecake gelato was a treat, but my daughter was told she could not take her cone out of the restaurant. We saw others being told the same thing, then leaving them at the restaurant. My daughter left hers too. It seems like such a waste - if customers are not permitted to take the gelato with them as they exit, why offer it in cones? Perhaps only allow for scoops in a bowl. It was frustrating to watch customer after customer simply dump their cones since they could not walk out with them!

From there, it was back to the pool for a relaxing morning, then back to the fitness center. The women's changing area is massive and clean - it also contains a jacuzzi tub and sauna! ( I never knew that!!)

Check-out was a breeze, as was retrieving our belongings from the concierge. I mentioned to the bellboy when storing our bags that we had cookies in one and we didn't want them to be reduced to crumbs. I am happy to report that we had four in-tact cookies when we retrieved our bags, thanks to his care.

Overall, a positive, happy experience!",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"we booked a room for my mom’s 60th birthday. when we checked-in the girl in the concierge greeted us with a smile and very accommodating. she even asked us if my mom had already a senior citizen card so she can avail the discount. good thing my dad has. they gave us the new renovated tower wing corner room. the room is well lit and spacious. the view is the shangri-la mall which has a connecting bridge from the garden wing of the hotel. the pool is very crowded when we get there and the pool with a slide on it is under maintenance. we ordered pizzas from paparazi and had it delivered in our room. the taste of the pizzas are so-so. their breakfast have many varieties but very expensive Php 1,985 per person. the overall experience is nice and we definitely book again.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"This is the oldest and greatest ShangriLa in Manila; so I can tell you that after staying in more than 7 Shangrila Hotels every where in Asia: HK, India, Japan, Taiwan, Phillipines, etc. this one I really enjoy it. The warm reception and service was amazing and the atmosphere of the hotel and its great restaurants were also super good.",Food:Staff:Location
"We have stayed in various Shangri-La locations including this location. And with the Shangri-La brand, you would expect a certain level of quality.

Unfortunately, it may not be case all the time.

Disappointments during a recent stay include numerous signs of aging of this hotel. Foremost of which was a weird, funky smell of the hall carpet. Fortunately, the room didn't smell. The bathroom towel had hair. And the room was dusty. It may have been unoccupied for while(?). A call to housekeeping for a few toiletries was also slow. We needed to make a followup after sometime.

Lots of lining up also highlighted the stay: lines for breakfast & for checkout were quite long. Probably because it was a packed weekend. The staff did try to manage the line well.

Parking was also difficult.

This review is not 1/5 as we still did get the expected quality from the breakfast variety, overall amenities and general room stay.

I hope Shang ensures consistency all the time.

We still look forward for a better Shang stay in the future.",Cleanliness:Food:Staff
"It was such an exciting experience to stay in a luxury hotel-- from check-in, I couldn't contain my excitement until the time we reached our Garden Premier Suite. I paid a total of P16,000 plus as a birthday treat for my daughter who just turned eleven. I was impressed with the suite assigned to us, but there were things missing like the bubble bath and bidet, but that was acceptable.

I loved the Horizon Club Lounge experience wherein we enjoyed the cocktails nd canapes from 5-7pm. The Lounge was open 24 hours and the staff there were very accommodating and we had a pleasant experience. Drinks are available for the Horizon Club room guests. Good thing that my suite includes this benefit and you are given VIP treatment as their guest.

Everything was okay until we went to HEAT to have our complimentary breakfast. The receptionist asked our room number and since she seemed having trouble finding my name in her list, she escorted us to a table for us to be seated and wait. After few minutes, she came back and asked if nobody informed us that F&B is not included in our room that we availed. I told her that I was given a piece of paper with the benefits of a Horizon Club Lounge guest-- that I have the option to have my breakfast in Heat or in the Horizon Club Lounge. If I can have my breakfast in their executive lounge, how come I cannot have my breakfast there? She was hesitant and she left to double-check. She came back and informed us that since we stay in a suite, it comes with FREE 3 breakfasts. I was waiting for her to apologize, but she didn't. It's a good thing that I was able to control my temper at that time. If I didn't ask, I wonder what would have been our expression if she escorted us out of the restaurant and left us being humiliated.

After having our breakfast, we went to the pool to have our morning swim. I called their hotline to ask if I can be given time to extend. A male agent answered my call and he informed me that due to high demand of the rooms, the latest time that they can give us is still 1pm. I clarified about the breakfast because I didn't want to have any hassle in checking out so I want to know ahead of time about the additional charges. He informed me that our room doesn't include free breakfast. He was even surprised to find out that we were able to have our breakfast and insisted that it's not really included. I told him that Ms. Shai already informed us that our suite includes breakfast for 3. He transferred my call to the front desk but nobody was responding or taking my call. I decided to just go to the front desk personally and I was able to speak with Ms. Len who was very professional and accommodating. She confirmed that our Garden Premier Suite includes breakfast for 3 and apologized for the inconsistency of the staff with the information.

Though I super loved the pool, gym and jacuzzi, I was disappointed because for a five-star hotel like Edsa Shangri-la, there should be less mistakes. Anyway, I was given an extension for 2 hours so we left at 3pm for late check-out.

If only the hassle about breakfast didn't happen, our stay would have been perfect. I intend to come back some other time but I hope that this won't happen again.",Food:Staff

"If you are planning to have a family staycation of course Shangri-la edsa manila is one to be consider for many reasons:
1.pool side- i'll give the highest rating of 5star
2.dining area,reception and lobby- 5 star
3.hotel staffs-5 star rating for their best effort in assisting the guest.

Now regarding room amenities i'll also want to give a highest rating if not for these reasons..
1.toilet bowl- no bidet (it's a must have)
2.no plates,spoon and fork: though our family booked a connecting rooms with no breakfast, still necessary utensils should be provided.
3.refrigerator must be filled with essential stuffs..for afterall once it is consumed, it will be automatically charged to the occupants since upon checkin there's a guaranteed php 2,500
Deposit each room for any untoward incident.
3.aircon: 2 star
So I'm comparing Shangri-la Manila to other hotels that we have stayed from the past..if not for the reasons above..i would say that, you have to experience Shangri-la afterall",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Not my first stay at the Edsa Shangr-La hotel in Manila but as usual I was not disappointed with the attention and the quality of service received during the visit. I usually stay at the Edsa Shang for business reasons when travelling with work in Manila but this time was a vacation with myself and my partner. We checked in smoothly under a priority check-in system as part of my Golden Circle scheme. This meant skipping a small line and going right to priority desk. As with everything else at the hotels this is managed perfectly buy the check in hostess who was scanning the lines for any GC members. We had already made some requests through email prior to arrival and upon check in the front desk agent confirmed the details and we were quickly on our way to the room. Accompanied by the luggage attendant which had seen to our luggage upon arrival. Seamless. We had a large room in the tower wing this time which was the usual level of luxury which I look for from my Shang experience. We quickly made ourselves comfortable and headed down to the pool area. Again as part of my GC package we enjoyed an early check in at 11am which meant it was lunch time and we were both hungry. By the pool we were able to secure a couple of sunbeds helped by the pool attendant supplied with four soft fresh towels and huge umbrella which is helpful as my Phillipina partner is like all Philippines residents allergic to direct sunlight. We ordered a combination of something local, Pork Adobo and something Western, Club Sandwich and it quickly arrived at pool side and we enjoyed it very much. What I love about the Edsa Shang is the resort vibe. You can hang out by the pool make use of the pool bar and the swimming pool and it really feels like you are in a resort outside the city. I love it. It was basically Holy week which meant a much higher price for the flight but a reasonable price for the stay in the hotel. I really thought that Manila would be quiet due to most locals heading to the cost. In some way this was true. There was not a lot of traffic in the city as a lot of places were closed. For example the Shang Plaza Mall which is attached to the Shang resort was closed on Thursday and Friday. The Shang itself was absolutely jam packed with locals and this meant the pool area was very busy, pretty much Thursday through Sunday. The additional guests were managed well by the hotel with an increase in staff in all areas so at no time did we feel like we had to wait or that the hotel staff were stretched to accommodate more people. We had a spar experience planned which we chose a Wellness deep relaxing couples massage. This was an amazing experience and we both really enjoyed it. So much so that we arranged a Aroma Wellness massage for later in the stay. This again was an unforgettable truly relaxing experience. We ate at the HEAT breakfast buffet which caters for every kind of food and is without doubt the best dining experience ever and never disappoints me. In the evening we chose to eat in the Lobby Lounge and listen to the live music. The room was kept clean and they regularly turn down the room in the evening so you always feel like its fresh. We also had cakes left inside the room due to our anniversary and my partners birthday. I can’t wait to re visit and enjoy the facilities again. Thank you EDSA Shang for never leaving me unimpressed.",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"I’ve been a regular in this hotel everytime I go home since I started to be based abroad and it’s only now that I had time to write a short review. The frequency of my stay can speak for my level of satisfaction. If you’re in the Philippines, it’s already a given that the customer service is always above par which applies to this hotel. But what the hotel brings is the convenience from its always well-kept and constantly upgraded amenities to its superb location. If you want to savor your short stay in Manila, better stay here at this hotel because almost everything is at your reach i.e. LOCATION is its best come on. Needless to say that it’s a Shangrila brand and it lives up to its global name and reputation in terms of first-class guest services and the ambiance. For every little concern, they attend to it right away and cover up for any shortcoming pronto (with some pastry or fruit platter to come with it). The breakfast at the Heat is also something that is not available in just anywhere – everything you crave for at breakfast is most likely to be available there.

Security can be too tight though. Understandably it’s all for the guests’ safety but sometimes it can be of inconvenience having had your stuff being checked several times and go around far pedestrian routes just to reach the main street. I may have gotten used to other countries where people just go in and out of hotels without so much fuss. Bottomline, this hotel’s measure is even commendable but guests should just be prepared to go through this.

One thing that the hotel should revisit is the price to pay by hotel guests for valet parking. I would understand if non-hotel guests are charged of such amount but for hotel guests, this should be free.

Despite of what I’ve mentioned, there are much more pros than cons on this hotel so I will remain to be a regular as long as they maintain their quality of service.",Food:Value for money:Staff

"We stayed here during the easter holiday. The rooms were nice and the hotel staff were able to accommodate our special requests. However, we were disappointed with the food and restaurant service. Breakfast used to be good but this weekend it was not. We also attended their easter event and the waiters were rude. They served the sit-down snacks of 6 people in our table then skipped my family and went on to the next table. I asked them why they deliberately skipped us and they just ignored me. I had to ask the manager to call their attention and serve our food. I hope they would train their waiters to be more courteous to their guests because we are all paying customers.",Staff:Food

Stayed in this hotel last March 22-24 for a convention. The lobby is still grand but the rooms are not. I stayed in the Garden Wing and the room is musky. Carpet needs to be replaced or should be well maintained. I had to request it to be vaccummed because I was starting to feel sick. For a 5 Star Hotel it the accommodation falls below my expectation.,Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"The hotel is adjacent to the Shangri-La Mall and near Megamall, but the area around it is busy, crowded, and smoggy. Even the window view is dismal. As for the hotel itself, it still looks okay but the signs of aging are very obvious. The walls are thin enough for me to hear the noises from rooms on either side of mine. However, I was most disappointed in their staff for their dishonesty and inefficiency. First, I queued for more than 30 minutes before checking in. I was in line at 215pm and didn't get to the front desk until 245pm. The hotel was undermanned on a busy holiday. That in itself was already disappointing, but things got worse. When it was my turn to check in, the front desk staff handed me the key card to my room at the Garden Wing. I had to interrupt while she was describing the amenities. A Garden Wing room? But I booked a Tower Wing room which is more expensive by a couple of thousand pesos, I said. She said that since I requested a quiet room, the Garden Wing room would be a better option. I couldn't believe she was giving me a room that's cheaper than what I paid for! So I stood my ground. She finally admitted a Tower Wing room wasn't ready yet. Note that I had prepaid my room in full via credit card so I don't understand why they didn't prepare a room for me. Also, based on my previous experiences with other hotels, they upgrade your room and not downgrade it if the one you booked was not available. If they couldn't upgrade you, they give you a voucher for a discount or freebie. Plus you get an upfront explanation, not a deceitful tactic. The staff didn't try to explain to me why my room type was changed until I asked, and when I did ask, she made it seem like being given a lower-priced room was a favor she was doing for me. But I wanted the room I paid for. She said a Tower Wing room would be ready in an hour (4pm) and that I could extend my stay by an extra couple of hours to make up for the hassle. I clarified: Could I check out at 2pm for the usual 10-hour stay, or could I check out at 4pm for a 12-hour stay? You get 12 hours, she said. It was another lie. The next morning, I approached the front desk to ask about my late checkout. Another staff member told me I could check out at 2pm. I asked about a 4pm checkout as was promised, but she said my booking records didn't have any special note, and that I had to leave at 2pm because someone was checking in right after me. So I checked out at 2pm, went straight home but I didn't unpack until two days later. After I unpacked, I realized I left a pair of earmuffs at the hotel. I emailed them to ask if they secured my earmuffs. The reply I got said the housekeeping staff didn't report anything lost. Because I was busy, I asked my mom to call them up. She told them that it was impossible they didn't see my earmuffs because they were bright pink and they were on the bed. She also said that in her experience, other hotels had called her first whenever she left something behind, way before she realized she left something (this was my experience too, though it happened to me only once before). My mom pretty much gave them a lecture, so the staff she was talking took down her number and told her someone would call her. Later in the day, she got a call. They said they found my earmuffs because they just finished cleaning the room. But wait, I thought someone was checking in right after me? That was the reason they gave me when they told me I couldn't check out at 4pm. But two days later, they told my mom they didn't find my earmuffs because the room was untouched until that same day. So someone was lying for sure! They inadvertently reveal their lies with the inconsistency in their stories. But let's say they did clean only two day after I left. If that were true, isn't that unhygienic?To top it all off, when I went to pick up my earmuffs, they made me wait 45 minutes at the lobby! My experience with this hotel is awful, from checkin to checkout and beyond.",Staff
"This I can say is one of the best hotels in Manila. Upon entering the lobby, you’ll feel the elegance . We stayed here on December, so there were lots of Christmas decors and was amazed by the beautiful hotel personnels who assisted us. You won’t even feel that EDSA is just on the other side. The ambiance of the hotel makes me forget that I am just beside the busy EDSA. The room is quite maintained. Breakfast is at The Heat, where you have plenty of choices. If you are celebrating a special occasion, you can mention it in the lobby upon check in. They will then send you a token like a slice of cake.

"I booked a Tower Wing Horizon Executive room for a 3 day stopover in Manila. The room was spacious and well appointed. I used the app to check-in, and the keys were quickly handed to me after which the staff member simply departed… leaving me standing in the lobby. Since this was my first time at this property, I would have appreciated some basic information about the hotel features and how/when to access the Horizon Club Lounge and a map for the surrounding shopping venues, church, etc.

The swimming pool has a bizarre series of floating dividers, presumably to allow guests to swim laps. However this is a lagoon resort style pool used mainly by families. I never saw anybody swimming laps. I can understand putting a divider around the deep end, but all the rest was overkill for this set up.

"General: Excellent! From accommodation to food to service! Best hotel so far (insofar as hotels within the city is concerned)

Disclaimer: stayed for 3 days 2 nights; room was probably a tower wing deluxe room (please correct me if I'm wrong based on the pictures)

Room: 5/5 Excellent! While quite small, it was very spacious as it seems; very comfortable bed, probably the best I've slept in; internet was fast and adequate; minibar was complete but pricey; had a very classy feel with a feeling of home; it might be the standard room, but they sure make you feel grand!

Comfort Room: 5/5 spacious and well designed, a bit cramped though; water was very responsive to temperature change; refills very consistent; toiletries were very luxurious with no feeling of dryness, makes you feel great after a good long shower!

Amenities: wasn't able to try the pool and the poolside area as it was drizzling

Food: 5/5 Excellent! One of the best, or if not, the best breakfast buffet you'll find! The choices keep changing every day which makes each day interesting and exciting; the food had the impression of being prepared especially for you; they even have an espresso machine

Location: 5/5 while on the way was traffic, once you get there the place is amazing! It's beside the shangri la mall which makes it easy to go shopping or get some additional groceries, personals, or grab a bite to eat; it's also near SM megamall if you fancy extreme malling; pretty easy to get a ride also

Service: 5/5 very accommodating! Always service with a smile; always ready to serve without hesitation

Attitude: 5/5 they make you feel warm with sincerity; would always make you feel better even if they couldn't cede to your request

Conclusion: 5/5 Excellent! What more can I say, it's Shangrila! One of the best hotel experiences I had; I'm actually looking forward to the next time I stay there; One of the unforgettable experiences indeed..",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Edsa Shangri-La last 24th Feb and we did not regret holding it there.

The exterior of the hotel, especially the Tower Wing needs repainting. The rooms need refurbishment too to make it more modern and amenities such as towels, etc. need to be replaced with new ones. Other than these, overall, the hotel itself and its facilities have
been kept/maintained really well. Its beauty still lives up to industry standards.

We held our reception at the Garden Ballroom. The ballroom has low ceiling but was big enough to accommodate around 150-160 people. It is completely excluded from the rest of the ballrooms which makes it more exclusive, private and less busy. There is a foyer where you can receive guests and also a lift which makes it convenient for guests, especially for the elderly and disabled.

Regarding the staff, I have nothing to say but to commend the hotel staff who attended to us during our reception. The staff were all attentive, accommodating, hospitable and very helpful to all of our guests. Christina, our wedding butler, did a fantastic job in attending to me and my husband.

The hotel staff did really well too in dealing with our lost luggage at the airport. They had communicated with the airport and had done everything they can to retrieve the luggage. They also returned our personal belongings which we left behind upon check out. Edsa Shangri-La has a very good Concierge and Housekeeping staff. Our biggest compliments to their teams on duty during our stay (23Feb to 26Feb).

We especially would like to give recognition to our Events Manager, Ms Winnie Alambra who has been so patient, organised and helpful and who has been very accommodating with all our requests, concerns and follow ups. Our wedding would not have been a success without her help.

The only problem/hiccup we had was at the front desk during the check-in on the 23rd Feb for one of our relatives, the groom's father (THE VIP!). They could not find his reservation and kept on insisting on another booking. They would also not check-in his wife, because she did not have a government issued ID, despite presenting them with different club membership IDs and credit cards. She waited at the lobby for an hour. This was very frustrating and embarrassing on our part as the hosts. Other 5-star hotels would think outside of the box and would come up with an immediate solution. This was very disappointing especially it happened a day before my wedding.

We wish the front desk would improve their communication with their Reservations and Events Departments to avoid situations like this. This incident left us agitated that afternoon.

"Wanting a great place to stay where you are right smack in Ortigas where you can just walk to all the shopping malls in the area without the hassle of traffic, this is a great place to stay in. Breakfast was great as it should be with Shangri-La standard, despite the fact that we stayed over during Chinese New Year where it was very busy, the hotel was able to handle the hustle and bustle of people.

I would suggest maybe they open another location or restaurant for their breakfast, like in some of the other Shangri-La's I've been to, so as to avoid having queues during their peak times. It really seemed odd having a queue in the middle of the lobby, but they did try to provide entertainment to those queuing, with a magician, which I assumed was provided by the hotel.

It's actually one of the more affordable Shangri-La Hotels in comparison and I think it is really value for money if you factor its location, its service and facilities this hotel has to offer.

One final thing though, I would have thought valet parking would be free if you would have a room there, but apparently only the parking is free, but for the valet service you would need to pay every time you'd use it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

The service is great and the restaurants in the hotel very good. My favorite is the Japanese restaurant. The pool looks like paradise though visiting for business, so I never had time to use it. I upgraded to a package for $50 a day which included my transfers to and from the airport and unlimited laundry. For my stay, it was well worth it. Only problem was I wrote on the laundry slip to Hang dry my jeans and they did not so now they are too short and a little tighter. Ugh.

Check in process was very smooth.

Ate breakfast at Heat on two mornings. Buffet selection was very broad. Only minor issue was getting seated (long queue) and then the wait for a coffee, and then getting the breakfast dockets (which took ages to come out, and was confusion as to who who’s was who’s, surely they should just mark you off at the door).",Food:Comfort & Facilities

"It’s probably not the nicest hotel of the Shangri-La chain but I didn’t find it as old as some people described it in some reviews. Rooms are well-furnished and comfortable. Checking in was done in the room and therefore very fast and efficient. Checking out was a bit longer due to insufficient staff at that time. All the car transfers I requested were perfectly organized. There is nevertheless one point that I disliked : the restaurant. For diner, the food offered at the buffet was of limited choice and quality although I appreciated the wine buffet option. One breakfast was acceptable (although again with limited number of items that I liked) as I took it a bit late, but another one I had at 7 AM was really painful: I was given a piece of paper with my room number and had to find myself a table and since everyone was told the same it was very messy; never got a chance to see a waiter as they were all running around so the coffee was not an option on that day
; I had to fight to get a fork .... and I don’t mention the noise level that is close to a railway station coffee shop. The next day I preferred to skip my breakfast to avoid the torture. I think that the restaurant is undersized and understaffed compared to the hotel capacity during peak hours... so you better wisely choose your time for your breakfast if you are really hungry!",Food:Staff:Value for money
"Let me preface my review by stating that in the week and a half prior to my stay at the Edsa Shang my family and I stayed at the Shangri-la Fort and Shangri-La Mactan in Cebu. Maybe I was expecting too much from this hotel and if this were the only hotel I stayed at during my trip it could be considered an average stay.

The hotel itself is grand and luxurious and it is easy to forget about how hectic it can be just outside the grounds being near Megamall and edsa (road). The tower wing premier room was spacious and clean.

Where the hotel fell short was in its service and secondly, it’s restaurant (Heat). There was nothing that stood out as egregious but it was an accumulation of things that make me not want to return to this Shangri-La. Being a 5 star hotel and a Shangri-La, I was expecting the same level of service throughout all their philippines locations but I was wrong.

Arrival: Arrived on a Saturday evening by Grabcar at the main entrance. The bell men/greeters seemed unorganized and confused as it took some time for them realize we were checking in and that a trolley was needed for our luggage. The lobby reception desk greeter responsible for keeping track of guests in “line” lost track of who arrived first which kept us waiting longer than we should have. Check in procedure was standard.

Guest/Staff interaction: When calling the guest relations desk for toiletries, towels or bell service I was not greeted by name. It is typically not a big deal but a nice touch that adds to the overall experience. At other Shangri-La’s guests are greeted with a smile and acknowledgement by almost every passing employee whether it be the housekeeping, maintenance or other members of the staff. Did not have the same experience here.

Dinner at Heat: Arrived at the entrance and the hostess was no where to be found. We were not sure if we could simply go into the main buffet/dining area or wait for someone outside. A couple of minutes seemed like an eternity. Finally a hostess came and ushered us to our table. The offering for the night was a “wagyu” dinner buffet experience for about $50 usd per person. If you are in need of some steak or a slab of beef I can see how it can be a good experience considering steak isn’t as common in the phils as in the US. Expect paying for a mediocre food selection with Las Vegas type prices. Soda or juice appear to cost extra although they are bottomless.

Breakfast at Heat: Was greeted promptly by the hostess and led to a table with a slight view of the pool area. Our drink order was taken by the hostess and were welcomed to go ahead at make food selections at the buffet. While my wife was starting to get her food the hostess stated the table she gave us was already taken and requested that my wife follow her to a new table. After leading my wife around in search of a new table she was finally led to a table in a backroom/ private dining area ironically next to a person complaining to the manager about the bad service they were receiving. Once my family were all seated, we had to once again place a drink order with a waiter. Getting the coffee or juice topped off was an issue being away from regular foot traffic by the staff. I usually don’t expect much from a breakfast buffet but the selections were once again mediocre. The salads and veggies were not topped off so they had to be requested and the staff at the made to order egg station were not friendly. Being disappointed by the level of service and quality of the restaurant I requested that the room charge for daily breakfast for the next day be removed since I also had to pay a half charge for my 7 year old daughter.

Transportation: Be prepared to coordinate your own transportation in the area. The hotel does not have a dedicated taxi line and although management suggests using grab or uber it may be difficult to get one at peak times. My wife requested assistance from the concierge desk for a Grabcar or taxi for transportation to Makati but was turned away because their app was either in use or not available. They eventually found a taxi at the Shangri-La plaza taxi line. Attempted to get a taxi later that night without knowing about my wife’s prior issues. Requested a taxi from the doorman who relayed the request to a security with a radio. Close to 10 minutes passed with no status update or communication as to what was taking so long. The doorman seemed to have forgotten about my request even though I was the only
Guest standing outside. Asked the doorman what was taking so long but he had to check with security. Frustrated from the long wait I finally gave up and called it a night.

Made my thoughts known to various supervisors and shift managers about the lack of attentiveness and level of service at this particular location. Although they apologized and offered to make it up to us on our next stay (no thank you) my belief is that you will get better service from other hotels in the area.",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Our company annually holds seminars/workshops in this hotel. We book halls for our events, and rooms for the participants. With our recent stay (first week of Feb 2018), I can't help but notice some things which no one will expect in a ""5-star"" hotel:

1. Their restrooms in the basement parking are worst than any old cheap mall restrooms you can find - very dirty and it stinks. You would not think that you are in a basement of a luxury hotel; their basement parking is not well lit too.
2. The restroom (at least for the Male restroom) located in the Lower Lobby is not well ventilated. While it is clean, it definitely does not smell good
3. The carpet in their event rooms are old and stained. Either it needs thorough cleaning or needs to be replaced
4. And just a minor feedback - one bed light in my room was not working - which could be easily be taken care of if they are keen to details

But in any case, I'm still giving them a 4 star rating overall. I hope their staff should report minute details for improvement to their management, and their managers to religiously roam around to observe. They need to acknowledge that they have a quite old hotel that requires maintenance..",Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"We stayed at Garden Wing Premier Suite for two nights (Jan 24-26, 2018).
It’s a one bedroom suite w/ separate living room. The room is big enough for a family of five. We are two adults and three kids (11,6,1).
The pool area is nice & clean. Lots of trees around. Perfect for kids.
We tried their Mad for Lobster night buffet & we enjoyed our dinner. Lobsters were perfectly cooked. Room service food is also good.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money
"Me and my wife stayed here during our 2 years anniversary/valentines celebration.

We availed their promo that includes a poolside romantic dinner.

The room has all the amenities that we need and was well maintained. When we entered the room, we immediately felt that we are staying in a highly rate hotel.

The staff were all very friendly and accommodating which is always a plus for any hotel.

We had a great romantic dinner by the pool. The table set up was breath taking. The waitress was very attentive to our needs. The food was excellent and quite filling. Our set included a seafood salad, pizza, and steaks and prawns which were all excellent.

The breakfast buffet in the morning had a lot of choices. They had the usual filipino breakfast items but I loved the croissants and breads the most.

The only reason why I did not give 5 stars is because of the price of the food and drinks...150 pesos for a can of coca cola is just too much. We also noticed that no one offered to take our bags to our room when we were checking in.

Overall, we had a great experience and we would definitely consider going back again.",Food:Value for money:Staff
