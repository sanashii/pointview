"i love Edsa Shang! I've been there lots of times and I always enjoy my stay :)

Shangri-La is truly one of the best hotel chains in the world as evidenced by their pampering.
All the staff are courteous and very accommodating. I don't have anything bad to comment!",Staff:Food
"The EDSA Shangri-la is at a great location, in between 2 malls catering to all budgets. Food choices are plentiful all around - with food court, restaurants spread across the 2 malls. There are also 2 supermarket for those that requires it.

The hotel staff are all very courteous, greeting you whenever you pass by them. I sense that each aims to please the guest as much as they could.

The rooms are functional, albeit with rather dated furnitures & fittings. Comfortable beds with a nice size work desk with free wired/wireless internet.

I just have my grouse with the shower fittings. The shower head is loose and can hardly stay at the place where I want, which can be irritating when taking a shower.The tub also looked its age, with some stains & markings.

Also, the kettle in my room somehow is unable to switch off automatically. Though the switch has reverted back to the ""OFF"" position, the water still keeps on boiling - stopping only when I pull the plug out of the socket.

Minor irritants, but the overall service makes up for it.

Oh yes . .I love the gym. Its fully equipped with a wide range of equipment. And there are also more than sufficient trackmills around, even at the crowded peak hours.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"One word: CONSISTENCY. This hotel truly is so brilliantly genuine with their service. Really delivers. :D I've never had that experience of being inside a hotel in my own country and feel like im on a vacation abroad! Stepping inside the hotel doors is like being in a big kickass spa where you can just smell: RELAX! I don't know what they're spraying in their halls but it's terrific! In fact i want it in my own home. It smells like baby powder mixed with a fresh relaxing scent perfect for that getaway. As usual, check in was easy breezy and oh yeah all smiles! And of course, I was fortunate enough to spot the sweet helpful girl at the front desk from last time, Charlene, who very graciously helped me find all the ways and facilities -again!- to get me through my weekend getaway with my family - CHI, gym, pool for the kiddies, restaurants bakeshop for my sweet tooth and even the cute Cafe outside with the nook bookstore. (Just like I said before, this girl is bar none the best at front desk on all my hotel experiences and very helpfully assisted me when my iphone couldnt connect to the wifi. also thanks to wifi guy who came into my room and took care of it like in a snap! :D and the other front desk staff - Anne, Rizza and Wella - who all look like they should belong to a beauty pageant or something but all so accomodating as well.) Not that I need to say it but YEah, Service is still excellent! Of all the hotel staff uniform ive seen, theirs was really excellent and classy. Not at all like ""this is a uniform"" but like a filipino outfit thats really classy. I love it. Makes me feel more like being pampered by luxury.

Room at Tower Wing was big and has a his and hers lavatory separate bathtub and shower (tho i must say the shower pressure was not that strong boohoo) and luxurious bidet hehehe Bed was excellent tho really the tv really needs some replacing. It was an old big bulky TV, and though the furniture was well taken care of, it was a bit outdated and a shame for the price of the room. A couch and two sitting chairs comfy for some reading.

Tho i really must suggest some sort of smoking lounge aside from the Horizon Lounge since its a bummer to have to go far to get some drags on my ciggies.

Overall, I still really love this hotel and for sure there will be a reservation again in my name :D yipyip!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"When I land In manila, I do not have to worry about being picked up at the hotel, the van is always there waiting from Edsa Shangri la hotel. I have 3 children that are always with me, 2 daughters that love to shop, across the street is one fantastic mall, has everything you want and more. The restaurants in the area have such a variety, I dont worry about where to eat, what location to shop or how to get around the city.
The staff at this hotel are remarkable!! Maybe they take pity on me since im a single father with 3 children, but I know they have bent over backwards in every way to help me with directions, ideas and what events are happening that week and who can help me when i venture out on the town.
Top notch cleanliness, the restaurant is there to serve you with everyone taking a personal value in how they treat the guest. I will always use this hotel, I have tried others, but there is no comparison to other hotels.
thank you Shangri la for making our trips to the Philippines so wonderful, see you again in 2012.",Staff:Location:Food
"A real sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of Manilla. Excellent service, nice sized rooms, a beautiful pool area and one of the best breakfast selections I have seen in Asia. Highly recommend for the business traveller. A mall next door but I didn't get time to check it out.",Location:Food:Staff
"Apologies for the long review but I want to rave about this place. We visited really close family friends @ the Shang the day before we were supposed to check in at Microtel near MOA. We loved the place so much that we dropped Micro and checked in the next day! Service-wise, I felt spoilt as I was waited on from start to end! The Filipino hospitality mixed with the Shang training is second to none- I can only describe this hotel as the Singapore Airlines of hotels. We our hotel room was on the top floor next to the Luzon suite (our mates were in there). We lived like kings, they loved us!

The restaurant: Heat- the buffet restaurant was exceedingly good! There was sushi, Filipino, British, Chinese cuisine, all cooked to perfection: we ate a lot and I do believe I had 3 rounds before having my dessert, which ranged from ice cream, halo-halo, taho, sago, fruit, cakes (need I go more). The waitress/ters kept bringing food straight from the kitchen to feed all 8 of us, which kinda defied the whole point of buffet, but whatever it was good! Breakfast was exactly the same: it was just shy from silver service: more food brought to our table: tocino, bangus, mangosteen, mango, freshly peeled lychee, dim sum, cereal, croissants, french toast, waffle, pancakes etc... again defying the buffet- lol.

Gym: was okay, I'd compare it to the lower tier of Virgin Active (for all the Brits who know VA). It was till good (there was a male aerobic instrutor who was teaching a dance class- it was more like go-go dancing: was pretty funny). Anyhoo, good facilities.

The pool: was nice and really clean, and kept me cool during the day: great bar and loungers.

I would definitely stay here again, however, we were fortunate to stay with friends who were in a suite as we were waited on like kings! The room we had was still pretty impressive and the beds, OMG the beds, were like the best ever!

The hotel decor, scent/smell, service was impeccable and I will defo be staying here once again!",Food:Comfort & Facilities
"I'm used to staying at the Makati Shangri-La so the Edsa location is a bit of a disappointment. The rooms in the main section of the hotel are tired and in need of a refresh. It's still fine, but not at the same level of other Shangri-La hotels. The major issue during my stay was elevator. There were several outages and in fact they simply gave up trying to fix the call buttons, nailing a plank over the non-functioning one on my floor rather than repair it.

The spa is amazing, that and the pool are the highlights of the hotel. Also, the staff is quite good, very friendly and willing to help out with anything at all.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"The Shangrila was not my first choice. But, being a Golden Circle member, I kinda felt a little loyalty and wanted to build my points, so I gave it a try. Not to mention the special promotion of stay two nights, get a third free.

What a find. I would have gladly paid for that third night for the experience I had at the Shang. The experience starts when you first enter the expanse of the lobby, looking straight out at the two story floor to ceiling windows facing the lush garden. Immediately I wanted to drop my bags and grab me one of those fruity drinks with an umbrella.

Rooms were pretty standard, but what gives this a five star rating is what you find outside of the room - the Lobby Bar, the swimming pool set in the garden, and the breakfast buffet. Being at the swimming pool makes one forgetful. You forget everything – time, troubles, and that flight you have to take later in the day. It transports you to another zone, a zone where only happy things take place.

Then you go to the breakfast buffet, which was one of the best I have ever been to. United Nations of buffets, and this is for breakfast! Japanese, Chinese, Filipino, and Western, all rolled into one. Make a point to try this. Don’t tell them I would pay for that third night…I will be back!",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money
"Manila is ALL urban. Oy. And then there's Edsa Shangri-La. let's start with the entrance. CUTE dogs! Then you walk in and there's the way the whole hotel's scented. I've stayed here probably about three times in the space of two years and it has the same sandalwoody scent. I don't know if it's deliberate or not but this one familiarity immediately makes me feel like I'm in someplace I always return to. And I do! I go up to my room and leap into the BIG beautiful beds. Check. After a couple hours of cuddling, we go down to the fabulous pool. What more can I say? Fabulous swimming pool is fabulous. We order a burger and fish and chips (the same, all the time). My only complaint is they don't seem to have banana ketchup. What's up with that? When I get bored of the hotel (it happens), a short walk and I'm in the Shangri-La Mall. This hotel is as perfect as perfect gets. :)",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"We stayed as a couple in this hotel as a final treat in our otherwise budget trip to the Philippines. I'm glad we didn't start at this hotel as we felt extremely spoiled by the time we had to leave.
The staff is exceptional - well trained, friendly, happy and attentive from the moment we arrived until we took a taxi to the airport and...alas...back home.
The hotel has one of the best breakfast buffets I've experienced. Our room was fabulous. I wish we had time for all the amenities, such as the pool but we did walk around and everything looked great. If only every place had staff like EDSA Shangri-la!",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"This was my first trip to Manila and my stay at the Edsa Shangri-La made the difference - a wonderful tranquil hotel in the midst of the hustle-bustle that is Manila. Stayed 3 days back in April of this year. The entrance and lobby areas were beautiful, but not over-stated. Check-in was very simple: after the initial paperwork, one of the front-desk attendees showed me to my room and completed the check-in process - a very nice personal touch. Room was immaculate and well appointed - the best thing was the air conditioning - effective and quiet! The breakfast in HEAT was amazing - several unique stations - sushi anyone for breakfast!?!

Overall impression was fantastic - will definitely be staying at the Edsa Shangri-La on my next visit to Manila!",Food:Location:Staff
EDSA Shangrila is super luxury hotel in the heart of the city. It is around an hour's drive from the airport at peak hours. It provides complimentary Wi Fi and health Club facilities to all hotel guests. Jacuzzi and Sauna bath after the day long meetings is relaxing. Morning dip in a clear swimming pool is another plus. It has got a really amazing HEAT restaurant with variety of recipes.,Comfort & Facilities:Food
"We always love this hotel, better than the shangri-la Makati in terms of service and comfort. We're always satisfied of the service in every corner of this hotel . Staff members everywhere are very friendly. They remember our names and call us by name every time we stay in this hotel, that's how frequent we stay in this hotel.

Rooms rates are lower than Shangri-la Makati with the same comfort and elegance.",Staff
"Went here for a business conference and had indeed a great service from the staff, they are very helpful especially those whose at banquet and business centre. Room is as always in classic style, love the pool, so overwhelm by the selection of its buffet breakfast....

I enjoyed every detail, every moment , during my stay !",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Follow up from the front desk after a ""glitch"" from our reservation via Expedia was a little disappointing. Other than that, the service from the rest of the staff was excellent. We had breakfast at The Heat restaurant, and they had a variety of food selection and their food was great. Traffic was the only problem in this area. Mega Mall was only walking distance, and Shangri-La Mall was just a bridge away.",Food:Location:Staff
"During my first visit to Manila, the Edsa Shangri-La exceeded my expectations by providing top quality service and amenities in an ideal location. Highlights from my 10 night stay included:

The daily breakfast buffet at HEAT – made to order omelets, mango ice cream, and plenty of freshly baked pastries made this buffet a required stop before a big day of shopping or sightseeing.

The wine buffet with live entertainment at E’s bar – from 6pm to 10pm we enjoyed a variety of wines, mostly Spanish and Chilean, while listening to a live band (700php). They had a large selection of Sauvignon Blanc during our stay.

The pool – well-maintained and beautifully landscaped.

A comfortable room – the “garden” tower is the smaller tower and seems to have more up-to-date rooms. Our room was comfortable, stylish, clean, and well stocked. Cleaning service was through and efficient.

Close to MRT station – I was adventurous and used the MRT/LRT to access Cubao and Intramuros. The Shaw station is located on the other side of the Shangri-La mall (adjacent to the hotel). It was a quick 5 minute walk to the station and although the MRT and LRT were very crowded, even during non-peak times, I never felt unsafe and would recommend using it if you are familiar with large city mass transit systems. Ask for a “stored value card” for 100php, it will save you from standing in line each time you want to ride.

The free wireless throughout the hotel was also a nice bonus!",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Nice hotel for staying in Manila, I'm here right now and you won't have anything to complain here. Luxury it is. Although the staffs does not really much smile or look at you, maybe for respect and such. But the hotel accommodation is already perfect itself. Room was cozy as what to expect from a five star hotel. They also have Circles restaurant where you could have a fine dine at the evening, would be great if you have someone with you. Just awhile ago I have my friend come over to have buffet dinner with me. Very recommended if you have budget for a five star living. Thats it for Shangrila Edsa, need to regain my energy for a early wake tomorrow! P.S. great net connection.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I stayed for 2 nights in room 624 and I was impressed by the service. Though, the room was ran - down and gave a very old impression. It made me think of the living room of my grandmother who died 20 years ago... The chair at the workdesk had its best time and I am happy it did not collapse when I sat on it. Not that I am fat, but just that it was sooooo old.... The whole room gave a very old impression. Also, the shower was in the bath (not what I usually expect in a 5 star in Asia) and the showerhead was completely outdated, showering water all over the bathroom. Not good...

Service is really good. Also the food is very good in all restaurants which I tried. i can hardly recommend the food.

Overall : excellent service and location, though these rooms are maximum 3 stars.",Comfort & Facilities:Food

"Manila is a city of contrasts, the Shangri-La represents the best of Manila, a haven of comfort in a sea of chaos. The hotel comprises two wings set in beautiful gardens with swimming pools suited to all ages. We stayed on the club floor with a view of the gardens, it was very comfortable with excellent bed linen and plenty of clean towels. The club lounge staff were very helpful with all our requests and the standard of food on offer in the lounge was good.
Access to the adjacent shopping mall is directly from the hotel which is great as the traffic is pretty bad, crossing the road requires patience and a strong nerve
If we have to make a return trip to Manila we will certainly stay at the Shangi-La again",Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"We always stay at Edsa Shangrila whenever we need to stay in Manila overnight. Their rooms and facilities are clean. Great swimming pool, with brand new furniture. The Concierge team have always tried to accomodate our needs, always friendly and willing to provide a helping hand. The location of this hotel is very convenient, with SM Megamall across the road and Shangrila Plaza the other side of the building, both within walking distance.

Best new addition to the services is free wifi in the rooms!

However, I would say that the room rates here are getting more and more expensive, even at corporate or local rates. Might have to look for an alternative hotel accomodation next time!",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Location
"Our room had a view of the side of Mega Mall, overlooking construction works, which is the ""One"" Shangrila (5 star self contained units) and Edsa itself. The rooms consisted of a huge king size bed, a desk and table and a chaise lounge and a little glass table. The hotel itself is vast and members of staff are welcoming and efficient at their jobs. We ate lunch at the hotel poolside bar, the service was a little slow but we didnt mind as we were not in any rush, however they said this was not acceptable and gave us 3 huge complimentary platters of fruit, dumplings and soup and on top of that what we had ordered. The sun loungers on the sunny side of the hotels gets taken up quite quickly, so arrive at least by 10am. We were there two weeks before Holy Week and the pool area was pretty empty but by Thursday before Good Friday it was heaving. My only concern regarding the pool area is the little baby pool. I have suggested to management that they should put a sign up to say guests for only 4 years and younger as there were many older children using this and causing a little havoc for the youngers ones. The gym area was good, they also had a studio. Some of the equipment was a little outdated but I think they were in a procedure of updating whilst we were there. I had to use the Business Centre, again staff welcoming and efficient, a tad pricey but what did I expect??? Checkout on Good Friday was horrendous and had to wait a little while due to the number of people checking in, staff managed well but they were fighting a losing battle. Had a fantastic holiday at Shangri La and would definately stay there again as it is so close to everything. Also a bonus was a Starbucks in Shangrila Mall right across the Hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"From airport arrival to departure, the service was excellent. Staff throughout the hotel were cheerful, friendly, helpful and efficient - no exceptions.
Rooms were large enough and comfortable, the food from room service to restaurants was very good. Poolside service for food possibly a little on the slow side, but that's not unusual in hotels like this. The pool itself is a delightfully landscaped enclave, so much better than the Makati Shang. I've never seen it overcrowded, but then again I'm there midweek, not at weekends.
Nice newish mall next door which is a plus. Some construction next door as well, but never had any noise issues.
All in, a very good hotel experience.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I have been travelling to Manila since 2005 at least once a year, and up until 2 years ago every 3 months. I always stay in Ortigas or Makati at the Shangri-La (primarily Ortigas/Mandaluyong) because of the excellent quality, service, classiness, and security consciousness of this hotel. Broadband access is free via both hardwire and wirless in every room.

On all previous trips this is the only hotel I would stay in when in Manila and in fact the staff has come to recognize me and know me by name due to the frequency of my visits over the years. It's what I refer to as my home when in Manila.

This year I decided to try a new hotel (New Horizon Hotel in Makati) for the first week of my trip in Manila, which I was very impressed with and consider on par with shangri-la but for a much more affordable rate. However, for the remaining stay in Manila this vist we stayed at EDSA Shangri-La.

EDSA Shangri-La hotel is excellent and located in an excellent location close to everything you need. The rooms are clean, comfortable beds, very safe area - epitomizes a 5 star hotel IMO and is the basis on which I rate all hotels I stay at when i travel on business or holidays around the world.

There are numerous malls close by for shopping with the Shangri-La Mall across the street and the SM Mega Mall within 2 minute walking distance. Lots of places to eat and the hotel restaurants are excellent. This hotel is in Mandaluyong and pretty well part of the Ortigas business district. It is definitely the best hotel in Ortigas. Very grand and elegant.

My only issue with the hotel is:
1) The price has skyrocketed over the years and is starting to get pretty pricey
2) The traffic congestion is now so bad when trying to go anywhere outside or ortigas area during the day that I sometimes feel like I am on the 405 in LA during rush hour...gridlock with tonnes of pollution if you don't time your outings right :)

Novaliches is 10 miles away and Makati about 3-5 miles. This area can be busy during the day and quiet at night.

I would definitely recommend EDSA Shangri-La when a reasonable rate can be obtained. It is still one of the best hotels in Manila and easy access to public transportation, if you feel adventurous, or getting a taxi.

Atmosphere is very good, staff polite and accomodating, clean, secure, close to all points of interest in Manila....oh, and for the wife, lots of shopping :)",Location
"The perfect hotel for relaxation and shopping. Adjacent to the Shangri-La Mall, and a 2-minute walk to SM MegaMall. Minutes away from Ayala Center, Fort Bonifacio, and Greenhills Shopping Center.

"My daughter turned 3 this January and Edsa Shangri-La was our hotel of choice. It is close to our house and we wanted to spend a quiet weekend away from home to rest and to be together.

"This was my 2nd stay in Edsa Shangri-La and not many things have changed since my last stay 3 years ago: the rooms are somewhat oldish but clean and comfortable, staff is helpfull, while cleaning personnel is noisy and seems to be up from early in the morning indicating their presence by knocking at the doors and shouting all day long. Breakfast at Heat has an amazing selection of options and caters for any tastes. Pool area is great and allows to relax and enjoy the sunshine in the middle of the busy city. The hotel has several restaurants and bars, which are over-priced, though still offer good selection of food and drinks. Don't go for mohitos in Paparazzi - try cocktails from the lobby bar instead.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness
"The hotel is big with many rooms and it was quite occupied (this also gave it a feeling of being crowded). There was no personal attention.
It has a nice, big gym (free) with a friendly instructor.
There are amazingly vast options for breakfast (included in tariff).
The pool was crowded and the pool view room that I was given had a barrier, so it wasn't really a pool view room.
The rooms were small but opulently furnished.
The room service was good, too.
The location, although nice, did not really connect to the malls directly. A small stretch appeared lonely although the security was nice once inside the hotel premises.
Internet was free and when I had a few troubles with the Net, I was attended to promptly. Thus, I would consider this hotel a nice value for money.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food

The lobby is a little dated looking, but not embarrassingly so. Service was great - the breakfast buffet was very nice (albeit a bit pricey, esp after they add on 25% in service and VAT charges), and when I asked if there were mangos, the person made a special point to bring a plate over, even though they were not serving mangos that morning. It is w/in walking distance to several malls, and 2 grocery stores where you can buy dried mangos and other island specialities. Check out Floor 6 of the Shangri-la mall for several good food options (think upscale food court/family restaurants).

"A 5 Star experience, not that I’m an experienced traveler. Definitely better than Doubletree, Marriot, Hilton type hotels in the U.S. Very hospitable staff, always smiling and looking to provide world class service.

Can exchange dollars for local currency at front desk. Connected to Shangri-LA mall but can take 5-10 minute walk. Mega Mall is also within walking distance. Hotel arranged my transport from Airport and office for entire duration of my stay, no major issues, minor issues maybe in coordination of info as a couple times I cancelled my transport as it wasn’t required but they thought I still needed it. Located in hotel is the HEAT restaurant. I had the opportunity to visit Heat on a daily basis for their International Breakfast Buffett. Easily over 100 items of variety from traditional American style breakfast to Japanese and Chinese as well. They also had an desi breakfast station with Naan, Roti, Curried Lentils, Cauliflower, Okra, Spinach, Cabbage etc… In addition they had Keema(Ground Beef) and Curry Chicken. Verbal assurance from staff the indian food is halal. Ask staff to seat you outside for even better ambiance. Huge foyer which was decorated for Christmas season, they had live performances from musicians/singers. Pool area just beautiful. Well known location, everyone knows EDSA Shangri-La.

"I stayed at this hotel for 2.5 weeks as I was in Manila on company business. I made the choice as I had heard a lot about the hotel from my colleagues in the company.

The hotel is great for the business traveler. It is located in a tony part of Manila (Ortigas, Mandaluyong city) and is convenient for those who will be working at locations in Quezon City, Ortigas or Mandaluyong City.

The hotel is flanked by the expansive SM Megamall & the classy Shangrila mall and is close to Greenhills and Starmall, which is great for those looking to catch up their shopping.

My company's deal included breakfast, which is an amazing spread featuring continental, Chinese, Filipino and Indian dishes.

Room service is good too and I was particularly delighted to see the Indian vegetarian items on the menu.

"I recently stayed at the EDSA Shangri-La for 11 nights during a business trip. This was my second stay at the property over two months, my first stay was in the Garden Wing and the second in the Tower Wing.

First off, two week business trips are long no matter where you are and usually the only thing that preserves your sanity is a good hotel. The EDSA Shangri-La did just that. For two weeks I was well taken care of and comfortable.

The rooms were very comfortable, fantastic beds, the AC worked great and the room was a nice size. I have to say that the Garden Wing rooms are much more updated then the ones in the Tower Wing. That usually drives me crazy in a hotel, make all the rooms the same please. Either way though you cannot go wrong, although in the tower wing the room will be noticeably older.

The service at the hotel is first rate, everyone is extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was very nice as well and I had room service twice and both time it was excellent.

The fitness center is awesome, modern equipment and great locker area with sauna and whirlpool. The pool is also fantastic. The hotel is connected to a mall and across the street from another so its very convenient.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Staff
"The rest of my conference party is in the plush new Garden wing. But I must pay the price for being a smoker and get a room in the Tower wing, which means only wired internet and slightly older rooms. But I am not complaining, for the room is quite acceptable.
It's easy to get lost in the Edsa Shangri-la, with its multiple entrances and grand lobby but the helpful staff is around always to guide you. The room is reasonably sized, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is nice without being plush. But would someone make that irritating shower drip go away? Actually, would someone please change the bathroom fittings? They are well past their use-by date.
The breakfast spread next morning is wonderful. There are more choices than an ordinary stomach can handle, and the food is great. And when I decide to step out, the Ortigas Center next door offers some great shopping.
If you are a dog-lover, make sure you stop to meet the two (or is it three?) friendly Labradors used to sniff out explosives. They are lovely and if you don't look like threatening, the handlers will let you play with them - as I did - and make you feel less homesick!
I am returning to this hotel after nearly a decade. It looks bigger now, but a lot friendlier. Overall, it is pretty much what you would expect from a Shangri-la property.",Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness:Food

"I stayed a s a business traveller for a week. The romm I had was very spacious and very well serviced each day. My only minor complaint was that the decor is looking very tired and the TV was small by today's standards.
The hotel services were great, the buffest breakfast was more than adequate and the buffet dinner was OK for one night. The Japanese in house restraunt was excellent. The gym was well equipt with good sauna and steam rooms. I had an afternoon free by the pool which was very peaceful and very attentive staff.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri La for 2 nights. This was my 2nd stay at this hotel during the last 12 mos. It is a beautiful hotel with every amenity you could think of to include spa, health club, pool, and it's even connect to the Shangri La Shopping Plaza via a breeze way for your convenience.

If you want for anything at this hotel, it's simply because you didn't ask. They open the doors for you as you come and leave the premise. They are stationed at the elevators and press the button before you even arrive at the elevator doors. Of course, there is security both inside and outside the hotel including trained dogs. No taxi or vehicle is permitted on the premise without first being inspected.

The room is lovely. Mine had a large, comfortable king-sized bed with 4 large pillows. There are also robes and slippers in the room for use during your stay. The TV was not a flat screen, but was decent, worked well, and average sized (maybe 25""). The bathroom has a granite counter top, full-size tub, and a make-up mirror. I also love that they provide you with some complimentary fruit and water in the room. I generally arrive in the evening when I fly-in. I'm too tired to go out for dinner, but still a little hungry. A piece of fruit is just perfect. I must say, though, the only disappointment during my stay was the internet connection. It was quite aweful. It continually told me it could not display even the simplest web pages like when I clicked on an email in my account. It would not display the email and I would have to refresh or hit the back button 5 - 10 times before the email finally came up. It did the same thing with Facebook. Something that should have only taken me 5 mins. took me 25 mins., literally. I found this very frustrating. I know this is not typical because I've been to the Philippines a number of times and have stayed at 5 different hotels. I don't remember having this issue at any other hotel here before. In fact, the internet connection at the Holiday Inn that I'm staying at right now in Clark is wonderful.

As for other wonderful things at the Edsa Shangri La, the breakfast buffet is second to none! You can select from Philipino, Indian, Japanese, American, and some other nationalies' foods I'm sure I'm forgetting! Of course, they also have a chef there to cook your eggs to order. I absolutely love their breakfast! And again, their service is impeccable. For example, pushing in your chair every time you sit down and promptly taking away your empty plates.

Their health club is nice, as well. They have a nice men's (so I've been told by my colleagues) and ladies' locker room. Their weights and cardio equipment are in good condition, and cardio machines have built-in TVs for your work-out entertainment. Of course, towels and water flavored with orange slices are provided. They also provide you with a headset to plug into the TV, but bring your own from your iPod because I find them too small for my head (unadjustable) and I can't hear very well with them even at max volume. My iPod ear buds worked really well, though.

Overall, I would highly recommend the Edsa Shangri La for outstanding service and luxury.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Internet
"I recently had a pleasure to visit Manila for first time and stayed at Shangri La (Edsa). This is a very sophisticated, clean and upscale hotel in the heart of shopping, very convenient to different places in Manila and is very well appointed. The airport pick up had me listed as a guest and i was in the car within minutes upon my 10.30 pm arrival into Manila. At arrival, I was escorted (my bags were taken care of by the bell desk) and the check in was quite simple and efficient. I was escorted to my room by the bell boy who also delivered the bags.

The room was beautiful with a great view of the pool and the Makati sky line (i was on 13th floor). Not a lot of buildings have 13th floor. The room smelled fresh and was very inviting. The bathroom was clean and had a nice large sink with the standard amenities. The staff at Edsa Shangrila goes above and beyond to make you feel Royal and treat you like king. After my first week almost everyone knew me by n ame and would greet me. The breakfast at Heat restaurant was excellent and was almost like a lunch. I could skip or take a light lunch because of the food choices available. There was food for every taste (including Vegetarians). All restaurants at this hotel had great selection of food available for vegetarians like me. In my 2 weeks, I did not run out of options. This is very important to someone like me.

The facilities (Spa, Health club, Swim Pool) were excellent and did not have any complaints. The staff at all these facilities was very professional. The conceirge desk managed by Avis had great service and I was never kept waiting. My office pick up even past mid night and at 4 am were on time and i felt safe traveling in the Avis cars. The cars were good condition and the drivers spoke perfect english and were very knowledgeable about the area. They did have good recommendations for day trips for the weekend.

The hotel was proactive on my date of departure. They called me at 7.30 pm to let me know that there was an accident on way to airport and the anticipated journey time is 2 hours. I left at 8 pm instead of planned 9.30 pm and was glad that the hotel called me. If I had left at the original planned time, I would have not made to my flight. The hotel conceirge desk deserves kudos. The staff at Heat restaurant (Jesel and others) were very courteous and professional. They went out of way to make sure that everything is in order. The wait staff (Alex and others) were phenomenal. I am glad I chose this hotel for my 2 week visit to Manila.

This is the best service at a reasonable price.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"I've been to Manila many, many times, and have stayed at the EDSA Shang on at least 10 occassions.

It is the best hotel in the Ortigas area. The hotel sits between the Shangri-La mall and the Megamall, which offer dozens of dining options. The restaurants in the hotel, while very good, are also quite expensive.

For entertainment, it is a ~15 minute ride to Metrowalk or Tiendesitas or ~30 minute car-ride to Ft Bonafacio and Makati. It is also ~45 minutes to the airport.

The rooms are very comfortable, though not overly lavish. Beds are soft, and bathrooms are clean. Tip: leave a couple hundred pesos and a note asking for extra water each morning. You will generally be greeted with an ample supply.

While the Makati Shangri-La receives a lot of attention, I find the customer service at the EDSA Shang to much more personal and friendly, which is great when you're going to stay for a week or two.

The pool area is very nice and generally quiet during the week. The lobby is a good place to grab a drink or snack. The buffet restaurant, Heat, has a great breakfast, which I highly recommend if it is included in your rate.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
I spent a a lovely day and night at this wonderful hotel a few miles from Makati. Its ambience is most welcoming and inviting in its calming atmosphere. The lobby is magnificent. The staff provided superb service and the food was delicious. A breakfast meeting we arranged was held in a private room that was lovely and served our needs quite well. The rooms are beautifully appointed and I happened to see a suite that was truly luxurious. The hotel is conveniently near shopping but a away from Makati. with traffic in Manila the few miles can take a long time if that is where you need to be. Consider this if you need to be near Mandalayoung or Quezon City.,Location:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"First the staff are great very friendly and accomodating...The room is old (1418), dirty curtains, no flatscreen tv, the aircon is quite noisy you can hear a noise everytime you change the thermostat, the design is old compared to sofitel and newrooms of century park..Bathroom is regular..The pool is excellent, my baby enjoyed playing around.One of the best pool ive been to. Buffet breakfast, lots of selection except the place is crowdy and small. The floor plan is not well thoght off that you'll get dizzy where you want to get your food. The security at the basemnt parking is quite poor. Anybody can enter the basement parking and go up the floors thru the elevators. They should do something about this considering this is Shangri-la hotel....This is my first time to check in at this place and im quite disappointed, i guess i have just high expectations from shangri-la...For me stay out of this floor...I would still choose sofitel and diamond hotel.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Value for money

"When we return to Manila, we always use Shangrila EDSA as our preferred home in Manila. We've previously stayed in Shangrila Makati, but will always choose Shangrila EDSA over it.

It is very close by to SM Megamall, Shangrila Plaza (great choice of restaurants) and MRT. This hotel is also located conveniently to other areas of Manila, like Quezon City and Fort Bonifacio.

The customer service is great. I was unhappy about the first room we were allocated and our request to change rooms was promptly attended.

We received the complimentary fruit and evening turn down services. The breakfast buffet is definitely unbeatable with great choice of various international food!

The pool is big enough and the kids loved the slide and was open from early in the morning until 10 in the evening. This year, my nearly 8 year old learnt how to dive here.

I did look at the CHI Spa rates and was flabbergasted at the prices, therefore didn't try. I went to nearby Shangrila Plaza instead for any spa services.",Food:Staff:Location
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La in August 2010 for a business trip. I think the hotel is exceptional. The decor is elegant and the staff courteous. It may be that folks in Philippines tend to smile a lot, I would say at this hotel this was exemplified.

Any requests were handled promptly and though I am usually very particular on any lapses, Shangri-La did not upset. I felt they were on the top of their game.

The breakfast was great and for me was way too much variety for me to try everything. Even though I am a vegetarian I found that I was spoiled for choice.

The beds were comfortable and I slept well. The location is great too with two malls adjacent to the Hotel. I would recommend this hotel highly and would definitely look to stay there again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"The Edsa is excellent. Service in general is truly excellent here. There are plenty of fine dining options, a great pool area, and large gym all within the complex. There are a few shops inside (nothing significant), but if you want to shop simply walk across the street to either of two huge malls.
The gym is large with plenty of elliptors, free weights, and treadmills. Aerobics & similar options are available in a side room. I also believe personal trainers are available if requested. Each locker room includes lockers, showers, sauna, steam room, and whirlpool.
Dining is excellent - eat at the buffet at least one night because it truly is fantastic. Make sure you're hungry before-hand!!
I stayed on the club floors (business floors), so the rest of this review is pertinent to that area only: Staying in the Horizon club gives one access to the lounge - which includes breakfast, separate concierge service, afternoon snacks, and a limited bar in the evenings (all complimentary). Service is even more top-notch here. Everyone on the staff is willing & able to assist. I would absolutely stay here again.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Don't get me wrong, it's a nice hotel. But I was expecting more than what I'd received and for the price of the breakfast buffet, skip it. How can anybody eat approximately $25 worth of food every morning? Unless you are a HUGE breakfast eater, then yes, you will get your money's worth. To me, it wasn't worth it.

The rooms were clean and so were the bathrooms. The staff were very friendly, very nice, very helpful. I just didn't like the way the lobby seats were being guarded by the female wait staff. I paid a nice price to be a guest at this hotel. I didn't appreciate being questioned constantly while I waited for my business guests to arrive. I know they want someone to sit there and pay for food, but I am an Asian female and when I see Caucasians sitting by themselves which looked like they were also waiting for someone, they weren't being asked to leave and they didn't have any food or beverage. That left a sour taste in my mouth. I know the female wait staff were just following orders and I wasn't rude to them. But if the management of Shangrila sees my review, please don't ask the female businesswoman to leave when I was also waiting at the lobby tables to make a multi-million dollar business transaction. I was asked 3 times in a 20 minute time span if I am going to leave or stay! My gosh, I didn't want to purchase anything until my business guests arrived and I was a paying guest at this hotel!

Would I come back here again? No. Would I recommend this to a friend? No. I have stayed at many hotels globally, and this is okay in my book because of the way I was treated at the lobby. And lower your buffet fees. The food is good, but hardly anybody could eat $25 worth of food every morning.

And another reason why I didn't like this place, the location! EDSA is a bottle neck and a traffic nightmare! One night it was raining on our way back from Makati and we were at complete stop on EDSA for over 30 mins! I wanted to get out of the taxi and just walk which would probably have been faster! It was a very short drive in normal circumstances, but EDSA is a nightmare no matter what time of the day or night. If you are in a rush and you need to drive down EDSA, forget it. If you are coming from Makati to this hotel, give yourself about 1 hour to go through EDSA.

Lastly, the only saving grace this place had was Chi. That was good, but then again, not as good as the other spas that I've experienced.",Food:Value for money:Staff

"First and foremost its important not to get the two Shangri La's in Manila mixed up. The Chain has another property in Makati. The EDSA Shangri La is located approximately 1 hour from the International Airport but be flexible as my journey to the Hotel took almost 2 hours due to a road accident. In Philippines, when an accident occurs, the vehicles concerned will stop at the scene and wait for the police to arrive before they move the cars to the side of the road. This is a recipe for disaster given the traffic load in Manila.

The Hotel itself is located within a larger complex which includes offices and a shopping centre. I did not get the chance to visit the shopping complex but my colleagues told me that you would be spoilt for choice as far as restaurants are concerned within the shopping complex. Given traffic in Manila, this is a big plus so that you don't end up stuck in your hotel.

The hotel facilities were good befitting the Shangri La reputation for service and facilities. My only complaint was that I was wished 'good morning' by staff on 10 separate occasions between my room and the dining room where breakfast was served, which got a bit unnerving. The breakfast buffet was excellent with a spread that should satisfy every palate. Worth noting was the availability of Indian vegetarian options at the breakfast buffet.

Check in and out was efficient and was completed with a minimum of fuss. Bear in mind that the hotel comprises two wings. I was in the garden wing which was a fair distance from the check in desk. However there is a small reception at the garden wing which can also check you in and out. Took advantage of this desk when I checked out.

The only thing that surprised me about the hotel was the rates, comparable with hotels in Singapore, a bit on the high side compared with other countries in Asean. Having said that, the stay was comfortable and I didnt really have any complaints.",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities

"My wife and I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La from 27 January - 6 February 2010 as part of a tour package arranged by Hans Travel. We were originally booked in a standard non-smoking Tower room with a King-sized bed for $135 (USD), including daily breakfast buffet at HEAT restaurant. Upon check-in, we upgraded our room to an Executive Tower Suite for an additional daily charge of $39. Wow!!! What a HUGE difference! Our upgraded room was furnished with the biggest bed we have ever seen in a hotel, and offered a spectacular panoramic view of the city skyline with partial views of the hotel pool area. Living space was quite spacious, and the bathroom was also quite large with a separate shower and bathtub, two sinks, standard toilet, and a bidet. The shower easily accommodated both of us simultaneously. The complimentary broadband Internet access was an essential lifeline to our normal lives and worked flawlessly. The hotel staff was cheerful, eager-to-please, and consummately professional. We were personally greeted at least 6 times between the hotel front entrance and our hotel room. We enjoyed all the friendly greetings and abundant smiles throughout our stay. It never grew tired or boring for us! The Front Desk employee who assisted our check-in, ""Jen"", did a fantastic job of facilitating our room upgrade and offered great, quick advice on hotel amenities and services. The elevator greeters were unfailingly upbeat and courteous! The breakfast buffet at HEAT was simply incredible. Too many food choices to count, all freshly-prepared and quite diverse. We were blessed to receive table service by Jom, Noah, and John...they were attentive to our every request and truly went out of their way to ensure our meal was perfect. Chef Rico Mendoza was very quick to prepare all our food to our complete satisfaction and glee. I have never been treated so well in a restaurant in my entire life as we were treated during our daily visits to the HEAT breakfast buffet. My wife and I did make the mistake of sitting at a table one morning closely adjacent to the outside dining tables where other diners smoked while they ate, and the cigarette smoke did disturb our meal that one day. No fault by HEAT staff...we chose to sit there and declined the staff's offer to reseat us at a different table. Other than that one minor issue, I would wholeheartedly recommend all visitors avail themselves of the HEAT breakfast buffet. On a hotel-related note, during the last 3 nights of our stay, guests in the room right next to ours constantly smoked cigarettes despite being in a Non-Smoking room on a floor entirely reserved for non-smoking guests. The odor was quite strong in our room and we reported the problem to the on-duty Night Manager the first two nights it occurred. Rather than confronting the offending guests, they instead provided a deodorizing air ionizer for use in our room and deployed another one in the common hallway between our room and that of the smoking guests. It made our last few nights a bit unpleasant, but we tolerated it. I would've preferred hotel management to confront the smokers and offer to relocate them to another room on a floor designated for smokers. Oh, and before I forget, Guest Relations Manager ""Barbra"" was very gracious with her time and trust to accommodate a very unusual request for us that helped my wife order a very nice formal long skirt from a local tailor. Many, many kudos to her for her above-and-beyond assistance!

What really upset me was that the room was not made up after I came back from work at 7:30pm having been away all day. When I complained and asked for the duty manager, they sent up the housekeeping supervisor: a sweet old lady who kept wringing her hands and apologising...

Everytime we past by a hallway, they greet my friend, just my friend but not me, as if I wasn't there. They would apologize to my friend when the XBox doesn't work but not to me. When I ask questions they are completely rude but when my friend asks questions they would answer him very nicely. I've told that to my colleague and said she expericed the same way too. So I noticed they are just being nice to foreigners and well-renowned people. I'm not a show-off so when I'm there I just wear simple and decent clothes and slippers.

Great Location!! Edsa Shangri la is located right next to Megamall and Shangri la Plaza. This made it easy for eating out if you dont want to eat at the hotel, shopping without having to grab a taxi and any supermarket needs as SM Supermarket is where you enter to Megamall. I dont recommend you to select Edsa Shangri La if you need to travel to Makati or other places as the traffic makes it a very long drive.. best to select a hotel in Makati. But this was perfect for us as I had relatives nearby.
Food was fabulous! Part of the package was free buffet breakfast for 2 at HEAT restaurant my 9yo was half price and kids 6 and under were free. As I read in one of the magazines - one of the best buffets in Manila!!! Great variey and selection. It gets to be more busy on weekend mornings as locals enjoy a treat and also eat at the restaurant but the food is always plentiful. Had dinner twice there and the standard was as high! With great quality seafood, roasts, pasta made to order (my 3 kids loved this as they all enjoyed choosing the pasta, the sauce and the toppings). And we absolutely oved the dessert bar with great cakes and the chocolate fountain for the kids to dip their fresh strawberries /marshmallows on sticks. Not to forget the ice cream and halo halo bar!
In-room dining was quick and good serving.
Service is outstanding. The staff were always polite and willing to help. They were attentive as well, noticing things we liked eg at the restaurant, I liked this fruit and the waiter came back with a bowl full to assit me from getting up each time. When the waiter came and gave our ice creams by the pool he also came with glasses of water without us asking for it .
Pool was great - it catered for all 3 of the kids.. one on the baby pool and the other 2 older kids enjoyed the slide and the larger pool. The food at the poolside was also very delicious and a good serving.
The rooms were clean. Linen and pillows, etc were of good quality.
Used the gym as well which had very good gym equipment and shower facilities.
OVERALL - we loved this hotel. We decided to come back and stay here for another 3 nights (longer if we could) before our flight home. definitely recommend this hotel.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"We stayed for 3 nights at an executive suite in the newer Garden Wing. It was perfect - a huge room with a very comfy but firm king bed and a queen sofabed in the main living area, free WiFi, a printer, fantastic bathtub, separate shower stall with powerful jets, and L'Occitane toiletries. Other members of our party stayed in the superior rooms, and while very nice, were small, and had different generic toiletries/ and bath robes (not that it matters :-))
The kids, ages 5 and 8, enjoyed the pools very much! There was a wading pool, a water slide, and a big main pool with a delineated shallow and deep end. We stayed for hours! We enjoyed a dinner poolside - the menu was the same as the HEAT restaurant inside the hotel. There were only a few people swimming and dining at the various times we were out there - never crowded at all.
The Chi Spa was heaven! Absolutely, relaxing ambience, and private rooms. I felt silly first asking where the lockers were, and then discovering one has their own room with shower/steam! The foot massage, wrap were among the best I have ever had. By the time, I had my full body massage, I almost had a tear in my eye - ""I don't deserve this"" - but only for a little while :-) It was sheer bliss. I was trying hard not to fall asleep so I could really enjoy the tacticle sensations.
Breakfast buffet for 2 at the HEAT restaurant was included in the room rate. Outstanding buffet with almost everything. - assorted Filipino breakfast fare , crepes/omelletes,waffles made to order, tons of pastries, fruits, cereals, yogurts, sushi. (and at the time, there was a Korean ""food festival"" with a separate station with a variety of Korean food). The dinner buffet was equally impressive, but one could go across the street to the adjacent Shangrila Mall, and try one of the many many restaurants there, including a food court in the basement, if you want to get it cheaper.
The buffets could get a little bit busy, but the food items are quickly replenished, and there was no waiting to get a table.
The gym was your usual standard hotel gym, clean, but bigger area with more equipment.
Most important was the attentive service all throughout. There were attendants everywhere- always smiling and wanting to cater to your needs. This is more so in the restaurant, and definitely in the spa.
We were definitely pampered in this hotel, and we did not want to leave. Can' wait to be back!
Tip - If you are staying for more than a couple of days, consider buying a Club Edsa membership. It is supposed to be good for a year, but you get discounts on spa services, room rates, restaurants (not on poolside dining though), even the gym that you could immediately use. Some of them are even transferable.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Value for money

"I stayed at this hotel for ten nights with work, the hotel is very grand and very busy and in an excellent location. The criticism with this hotel is the service, although they are very friendly, they just dont follow through with their service delivery. Some examples of their failings are a) They tried to check me in under someone elses name and then argued about the offered room rate b) I ordered wine with my starter and it arrived with dessert after 3 reminders c) They like to bring you food but not clear anything away so you end up with plates on top of plates or removing them yourself d) Two of my team went down with food poisoning after the evening buffet but the reception worker wasnt even acknowledging that while he worked on extending their booking ....the list goes on. The rooms are spacious but tired and I echo a previous travellers comments around it can be noisy for daytime sleepers. However, the pool area is lovely and the spa is amazig and probably the best one I have ever visited. The super mall is literally across the road and caters for everything from beauty treatments to large supermarkets and a food hall for those who just want a snack. There are a lot of staff all of whom are very pleasant but as I said before they just need to work on the execution of the service delivery.

"Stayed here recently for business. I found the hotel in need of a renovation - the rooms were a bit tired looking and the public areas needed bringing up to date to meet the expected standards of the Shangri-La hotel brand. The breakfast buffet restaurant was chaotic - too big and too many people. The bar was too dark and had zero atmosphere - loud music, tv, no lighting, no consideration of decor - had one drink before dinner and then left rapidly!

The staff were helpful and the hotel was clean which is the main criteria in a hotel.

It was fine to stay in for a couple of nights - but I probably wouldn't rush back.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I had the pleasure of stayig at this hotel twice. I stayed for two weeks at a time about eight months apart. The hotel is beautiful and is across the street from great shopping at the megamall. The staff was so good that they remembered my name and what I liked to drink and eat during my previous stay. They served it to me immediately during the complimentary breakfast that we received as part of our package. The $20 ala carte massage was also wonderfull. There is a good sense of security. There's always a staff member in the elevator or when you get off. They must have cameras everywhere. They have these guys in green jackets with wires sticking out of their ear like the secret service. Very comforting to a girl staying by herself. .he restraunts are great and plentiful. They have italian and sushi restraunts. The buffet is great and overlooks the spectacular pool area, where you can order a drink or a snack from the restraunt. The only complaint is they don't get everything you say. Kinda of like your talking to one of those annoying call centers. I was working nights and sleeping days and even though I put the do not disturb sign on, housekeeping would call and wake me up and ask when they could clean the room. Also people tried to force their way in to check the mini fridge daily. It took about 3 attempts before we finally got things straight and we set up an exact time for them to enter the room after I left nightly. Once last thing their currecy exchange was very convenient. There's also a nail salon. If your going to Manila on vacation I recommend the Makati location. There's more upscale shopping and restraunts",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"My three night stay at the Edsa was simply perfect. I had booked the hotel through directrooms.com and got a B&B deal for a superior room. At check-in I requested a king size non-smoking room and I was given room 912. It was perfect for one person, perhaps a bit on the small side for two people. Everything was pristine with very good anemities and free fast internet connection. Perhaps the only negative points were an old shower head and a surprisingly cheap looking toilet seat, but all was in perfect working order.

The hotel has a nice range of restaurants and the Papparazzi serves wonderful food (try the Zabbaione!). The Heads restaurant has a buffet and also serves breakfast. It is a large and rather noisy place but there is a small balcony where one can escape the A/C and the noise.

The spa (CHI) is worth visiting for its amazing architecture alone, but the treatments are also top class and you feel truly pampered.

There is a large and well-maintained fitness centre which also offers yoga, pilates and other classes free of charge to hotel guests. Outside there is a (flood-lit) tennis court also free of charge.

The pool area is marvellous, and you might be forgiven to think that you were well outside the city of Manila as you relax with the sound of birds in the garden surrounding the pool.

For your shopping needs, there is not one but two malls right on the hotel's doorstep with an amazing variety of shops and restaurants. You can have your pédicure done in the mall or at the wonderful Head Zone (hairdresser's etc) at the hotel.

It is often said that staff are wonderful throughout the Philippines but they do deserve a special mention at the Edsa for their unusal pro-active attitude and the fact that they genuinly seemed to enjoy offering the best possible customer service.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"I spent a pleasant week at the ESDA Shangri-La on a business trip at this hotel. Location is good for visiting many of Manila's main organizations and businesses, and is right next to a couple of the city's main shopping malls. Transport services are well organized at this hotel, with their own fleet of taxis, at reasonable prices. My favorite features of this hotel were the very pleasant gardens and excellent pools (which are easy to use and complimentary). In-house food was excellent, with a superb breakfast buffet (very wide choice of different regional dishes, and great fresh juice counter), and the Chinese Restaurant (the Summer Palace) was also top notch, with very good, responsive service all round. The lobby lounge is lovely, with great garden views and an impressive setting all around - when full, though, the service could be a bit quicker, although even then it's still not bad. As for the all-important room, I found this quite typical of a 5-star hotel in terms of space and amenities, but very comfortable in short (and I particularly appreciated the coffee/tea making facilities as well as the generous offering of free mineral water every day). My only quibble was with the rather old-fashioned TV, which could have offered a few more channels, and with clearer reception. In sum I would characterize this as an accomplished, well-managed hotel which is great for a business stay.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"The hotel is located close to two big shopping malls, so it is good for those who would like to shop in Manila. It is however about 45 mins drive from the airport and 20 mins drive from the Makati business district. Traffic can be horrible in Manila so these driving times may be stretched.. The good thing is that the area where it is located is very quiet and peaceful. Taxis are available at the doorstep at all hours.

the hotel is quite big and has all the facilities of a good 5 star. Rates are somewhat high compared with other Manila hotels, probably because it is the only good hotel in the Mandaluyong area.

There is free internet in the rooms, though with cable (not wireless).",Location:Internet:Comfort & Facilities
"Last Jun 5-6, we stayed in Edsa Shangrila Hotel. It was a NIGHTMARE. We booked 5 rooms for an upcoming wedding. The most important room, the one for the bride, wasn't ready. It took 3-4 hours to get that room. We were lucky we had 4 other rooms, but can you imagine if we had just that?

The room we stayed at had a dead cockroach near the bar. My husband didnt tell me because he knew I would only make a scene. The ice bucket had water in it which made it seem that they had just let a guest leave and then let a new guest in. The curtains were non functional and you couldnt even draw them back to see the sunshine. Plus, it was noisy! We were on the 6th floor and it seemed like there was a party. Our friends on the 14th floor said the same thing!

The staff were friendly though and it make me think that that is the only thing going for them.

I had stayed at other hotels before (Dusit, Mandarin, Sofitel) and this would be the worst.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"Wow, what an amazing trip. We stayed at here for 4 days and from the moment we arrived, we knew we were going to have an amazing vacation. The staff was so friendly and accommodating. My husband and children loved it. We decided to upgrade our room for an additional 1,000 pesos.

Breakfast at HEAT was included and was always delicious. Tons of food to choose from and again, great staff. Pool was nice and there's a kiddie slide too. Nice gym with jacuzzi. The CHI spa was very nice. One of the best hotel spa's I've ever used.

Can't get over how properly trained the staff was. Strongly recommend this hotel to all tourists. You'll definitely be pleased. Hotel is located steps away from Mega Mall and Shangri-la Plaza. Mega mall is on the same side of the hotel. You walk down the main entrance and it's right there. At Garden View entrance is where Shang Plaza is. Very nice mall too. Staff was so nice that when they saw us return while it rained, they ran to us with umbrellas. So sweet.

Room service was always on point. Room was a bit on the small side but very well equipped. Great quality furniture. Desk for laptop and mini couch that also was folding twin bed. There is no hair dryer but they may have it if you need one. They do have transformers for gadgets that require 110v.

We did have a small issue with the bathroom though. Our bathroom overflowed twice. I didn't expect this from a 5 star hotel. The engineers were very quick at resolving the issue. We just turned off the water and it stopped and they came in to fix it. It may have been very messy if I didn't turn off the water on the toilet. Just be advised. Not sure they this happened twice. However, I didn't find the need to formally complain. This is how much I enjoyed our stay. I know that if I brought it to the attention of the managers they would have happily compensated my inconvenience but that wasn't necessary.

Overall, I can't stress enough how wonderful this hotel is. Worth every single penny. Made our vacation a memorable one. When I return to PI, will definitely only stay at the Shangri-La.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff
"We (2 adults + 1 teenager) were initially booked into a Premier room but on arrival the hotel offerred to upgrade us to a tower wing executive room on a promo rate which we accepted. We stayed four nights on the value rate. It was heaven. The room was large and clean. The bathroom was spacious and also very clean. The hotel staff are all very friendly and polite. With the value rate we had unlimited free laundry service which was great because we had alot from travelling around Samar for 2 weeks prior. We also made use of the free airport transfers. It was so good to be greeted at the Domestic airport terminal (NAIA 3) by hotel staff and escourted to our car. No worries or hassles about finding your own transport. The daily complimentry buffet breafast was excellent (Heat resturant) An amazing selection of food. Enough to satisfy you for the whole day.
We also made use of the swimming pool and the Horizon Club lounge services on a couple of occassions. All very good. Also took advantage of the 6pm checkout on the last day. A real bonus because our flight didn't leave till 10pm. Checkout was quick and easy. (over in 5 min)
The hotel is within safe walking distance to SM Mega Mall A & B and the Shangri La Plaza. Lots of shops to look around, movie theatres and places to eat. My wife & son had a good time shopping.
Even though this place is a bit more expensive than other hotels, we really enjoyed ourselves, always felt safe & relaxed and we feel we got value for what we paid for. Will definitely stay here again.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"we are loyal golden circle members of the shangri-la and brought my kids for an overnight stay for the easter camp event they were hosting. The breakfast selection was amazing, from japanese handrolls to french crepes to dimsum, but sad to say that is all there is to it. I didnt even bother finishing any of the stuff i got as i didnt think they were worth the calories. We were already forewarned about food at this hotel, but breakfast was bundled with the hotel room. I am just happy that we did not waste money on their dinner buffet. Room was clean, but needs to be refurbished soon. The hotel was operating at a full capacity, but at the Garden Wing where we were staying, it smelled like paint. I can not believe that they were painting the hotel at a time when kids were everywhere. I am sure that the paint they were using was not even lead-free because of the strong smell. Overall, I am very disappointed at this particular Shangri-la branch.",Food:Cleanliness
"Whenever I stayed at a Shangri- La or Traders property I could count on a reliable product. I would rather describe them as a tropical version of a business Hotel. That’s exactly what you could expect at the Edsa Shangri La Manila. I stayed on Horizon Club in the Garden Wing. Room layout and style was typical Shangri La- indeed well done but nothing to write home about. Horizon Club Lounge was well equipped with comfy chairs and couches. The quality of products and the variety for breakfast and evening buffet was very good as ones could expect in a Hotel of its class. For breakfast ones could even order hot dishes made to order. The evening cocktail hour from 6pm to 8pm comes with a daily changing hot and cold buffet as well drinks on the house. During the day you can help yourself with soft- drinks, coffee and tea as well as small snacks. The staff is more than helpful to assist you with any request.
Internet access is 24/7 free of charge in Shangri La properties and worked well within the hotel. Main “hint” was the totally overpriced laundry service.
The location of the hotel depends on where you need to go in Manila- I found it quiet convenient as there is a huge mall next to the hotel and a MRT station. Taxis are cheap but keep in mind that you could stuck in traffic jam for a long time. What I really liked was the staff in the Horizon Club- everything else is typical 5 star chain hotel with a tropical touch.",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location

"I had a balikbayan rate which I thought was about the rates in the States, and even requested a one way fare from the Airport to the hotel. Hotel was nice. Lots of security. Employees were very cordial and rooms were decent. I had a Garden View suite and a deluxe room adjoining.
Check out was an eye opening. The room tax and Philippine tax almost amounted to the cost of both rooms. I understand these cost since I've paid them at other hotels I stayed, but never to the amount I paid at Edsa. The hidden cost was definitely disappointing. Maybe it's just the way it is in the Philippines. If I ever ran my business that way, I would lose a lot of customers. Enough said.",Value for money:Staff
"I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La for a few days en route to Europe. I originally wanted to stay at the Makati Shangri-La because of the awesome reviews, but I have to say, the Edsa did not disappoint.

From the service to cleanliness to availability of services, everything was above what I expected. Of course, with that type of service, comes a price, but you definitely get what you pay for.

Plus, the location is just a short walk next to MegaMall with tons of shops and restaurants. The hotel has its restaurants as well and on certain days, the Italian restaurant and Japanese restaurant can be bought for a combined, all-you-can-eat price.

I would definitely stay here again.

The hotel is conveniently located to the Edsa Mall which also has many restaurants to enjoy. Try Sumo Sam on the 6th floor of the mall. You can also walk to the St. Francis Mall which has great bargains.

The service at the hotel is impeccable. They can't do enough for you. They are so polite. No where in the world will you find the service or politeness of the people as in the Philippines.

The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was lovable (complete with bath tub, telephone extension, sounds). The buffet was amazing, there were like 50 dishes served, everything was fresh.

"I can pretty much say that Edsa Shangrila hotel is magnificent!

Rooms:
We've stayed in an executive suite and a superior room. The rooms are clean with a comfy feeling. The housekeeping are very good! the cleaning was quick and they top up what you've used. The turn down service which we declined on all occasion except one night was also great! and if you dont want turn down service, they'll ask if you want anything in the room. The room service/private dining was bang on time! if they say its 30 mins, then you'll get in 30 mins (unless there was a mistake in preparation/availability in the food-which they will ring you to let you know what the options are). There is in-room safe, which i always look for in a hotel. Our bed is king size (on every room we stayed), it will fit 3 big people or 2 huge bodies..they are quite comfortable! i loved the very fluffy (feather) pillows and duvet. There is internet connection (usb cable) for a charge of 600+ pesos/day or 200+ pesos/hour (i cant remember the exact price)..coz we did not use it! since there is a free wi-fi in the lobby and the pool area.

Reception/Front Desk:
This is the down side of the hotel...Because some of the staff are rather too busy looking at the computer screen in front of them that they sometimes forget that the impression starts with them. In a few occasion that i dealt with them, 'some' are lacking with smiles and we felt like they were either tired working or they're are just like that. They stand out like a sore thumb, when EVERY STAFF are very hospitable and makes you feel secure and welcome. The reception/front desk is just ok .If its a quick, uncomplicated check-in and check-out, but other than that, things are different. Over-all, they are ok to deal with.

Concierge:
Professional and quick.

Security:
I've never seen such security checks, even in Four seasons in Paris!. They have trained dogs that sniff the boot of every car that pass the entrance to the lobby. They have security staff everywhere..metal detectors and even check bags (even though i pass them all the time..i just wonder if they know what they are looking for??..Only in the Philippines, as what they say) Anyway, we felt very secured.

Restaurant/Food:
The buffet in Heat restaurant is one Not to miss! I was quite confused on what food to eat first! its an open kitchen..They have international cuisine like filipino, chinese, halal, continental, japanese. All the pastries i could think of and they have my favorite TAHO (soft tofu). They also have sea foods at dinner buffet. Price for Breakfast buffet is about P1,126/person (18Euros) Dinner buffet is about P1,500/person (23 euros)..Not cheap. There are also other restaurants in the 2nd level if you want chinese, japanese, italian..They serve beverages and food in the Hotel lobby, where there are live singers for entertainment every night. There is a bakeshop in the lobby.

Rates:
The reality kicks in here..The hotel rate (published in their website) has increased for 2008. The Makati Shangri-la is more expensive since Makati is the most expensive place to stay in Metro Manila. Starts from 8kpesos (125 Euros/exchange rate of 64Pesos). The executive suite is about 15kpesos (234 euros)/ night. It is cheaper to get a local rate (for filipino citizens with proof of ID) which it can be cheaper by P1,500K per night. Try looking at different websites for cheaper rates (i did not find any that will be cheaper than their published rates). Shangri-la hotel will always be busy anyway.

Shopping Malls:
Edsa Shangri-la is adjacent to Shangri-la Plaza Mall and SM Mega-mall (one of my faves..duno why)..There are food courts and restaurants in the malls (cheaper). You can get taxi to the other shops (make sure its metered and negotiate the price before) taxi's always charge more for foreigners!

Over-all..i will definitely stay in Shangri-la hotel ..(as long as we can afford it when the price increase again..)",Value for money:Food:Staff
"My fiance and I stayed at the Edsa Shangri-La in December 2007. We were attending a family wedding in one of their ballrooms. Overall we enjoyed our stay. We agree with its 5-star rating - the rooms are luxuriously furnished with super comfortable beds, marble baths, full surround sound system (even had speakers in the bathroom), fluffy bathrobes, and yummy welcome basket with fruit. The service is equally 5-star - my fiance left his shoes in the shoe valet the night before the wedding and they came back polished and ready for the big event. We also played on their tennis courts...very fun, and the (very cheap) court fees came with a cooler of ice water, towels, and paper cups. We regret not hiring a ball boy for the hour - where else can you hire someone to run after your tennis balls for only $3 USD per hour?! The pool area is nice also with its pretty garden setting. We tried only one restaurant, the Japanese restaurant - fabulous! The meat was the best we've ever tasted, melted in your mouth! And the sushi was so good even my fiance, who is not a sushi fan, liked it. The hotel is right across from Mega Mall - an experience in itself - and the Shangri-La Mall, so plenty of shopping close by. It was my fiance's first trip to the Philippines and he definitely thought the Shangri-La was a first rate place.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food
"I stayed at the EDSA Shangri-La on two occasions, February and June 2007 for 30 days each on business. Since this was a business trip it is a little subjective as I cannot comment too much price, but if you are looking for a great hotel this is one.

Room:

I staid in both the end room (like suites) and the normal rooms. Both were quite comfortable, and cleaning serive was impecable,. They were very attentive to my needs and never had an issue. Alsways clean a nice bowl of fresh fruit every day.

Hotel ammenities

The overall atmoshphere at the hotel was very pleasent. Beautful lobby with a very clean and relaxing pool, even the waterslide was quite enjoyable. Again, the attentiveness of the staff was great., from the check in desk to the doormen. The hotel also offers 4 restaurantants (Chinese, Japaneese, Italian and a great buffet place). All restaurants were nice if you didn't want to leave the hotel, but not cheap. I have to say the lunch buffet at the one place was AWESOME. Again a little pricey, but would at least try it once if you are staying there. Personally after a while adobe and rice gets to be too much, so this was a pleasent place to eat.

The hotel also offers tours around Manila. I actually took one to the TAAL Volcano. Had a great time and no unexpected surprises, so if you are looking for a tour, the hotel will charge more the outside places but it seemed to be a safe bet

Location:

Being this was business, I didn't have too many choices, but unless you can afford the Makati Shagri-La, which is next to Greenbelt and the main city area, this was good. Right next to the hotel was the 3rd or 4th biggest mall in the world, the Mega Mall, which was a little run down, but bsically had everything and anything. You can't go wrong if you wanted to shop. On the other side was the Shangri-La Mall which was a bit more upscale and felt safer to be in. Also in this mall you can access the train. While they say it's not safe, I found no issue using it and even a good way to travel to Makati to go to Greenbelt and about. Able to see alot of Manila this way, good and bad. Also attached to the hotel is a great cigar bar, Chuchhills, spent many a night there and had a great time.

The hotel offers Avis service if needed to get around and don't want to take regular Taxis. Again, I had no issues taking Taxis daily to get around, if you do just remember to not negotiate prices and use the meter. They will always charge you a higher price then what the meter will show.

All in all I found the Shangri-La lived up to the expectations. I am sure there are other hotels with higher standards, but personally I never been to one where I actually felt appreciated being there.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities

The staff were all very nice from the guards outside to concierge, and to the guy at the elevators. The staff had no trouble switching my room to a higher floor when I requested it, made sure my suite was cleaned, responded promptly, delivered a newspaper and complementary fruits everyday.

The buffet each evening is fresh and well above the standard of any food you will get in local restaurants.

Outside the pool is amazing, but you may have to fight the locals for a spot in the shade (it's not good to have a tan in the Philippeans!)

Most importantly the car and bomb checks by the K9 group before you even enter the hotel drive leave you feeling secure and safe. Unfortunately it's an absolute must for the Philippeans.",Staff:Food:Cleanliness
"Just stayed here for 3 nights.

Some tips:
If requesting for 2 beds, make sure to say 2 Queen beds. We were given 2 twin beds (you'll see the size difference) on the 7th floor whereas our friends had 2 queen size beds on the 15th floor.

Food buffet was pretty good. I normally stay at Mandarin Oriental but the food here at Heat was pretty good too!

There are 2 malls that is right next to the hotel: SM MegaMall (really HUGE mall with a supermarket, food court, cinema, etc.) and Shangri=La Plaza (higher-end shops). Traffic in Manila is quite bad especially during rush hours so I recommend staying in this hotel if you will do business or spend most of your time in this area.

"My first visit to Manila, and a perfect getaway (even though I was there on business) at the Edsa Shangri-La in Mandalyuong City.

Security was heightened after a shopping mall accident two days earlier. Did not mind as I felt really secure and safe at the hotel, which had K9 dogs searching all items coming into the hotel.

The layout of the hotel is fabulous, with a spacious lobby bar with panoramic windows into the tropical garden that is the pool area. Staff was attentive and focused, very friendly without exaggerating. That goes from the cleaners to the bell boys, the concierge desk, check in staff and front desk. Just amazing! The staff at the elevators (part security, part service) felt like family after a few days and always had a smile ready for you.

Room was just ok, but since we had a convention deal at USD99, not much more to ask for. Had a cable internet connection which made both business and leisure easier for myself. It was humid at the time, which made the airco operation a bit tough. Either it was too cold or too humid.

Bathroom had a big bathtub and washing cloth line (even though it took three days for the underwear to dry with the humidity).

The included breakfast was amazing, staff friendly and attentive, lots of choices from Asian to European cuisine. Also tried out the buffet lunch at the Italian restaurant (second floor) which was above average.

Pool area was fabolous (see pics), as was the service at the in-house Spa, where you were treated as a king.

Night time we loitered in the second-floor bar which featured bands every night (man, those Filipinos sure love to sing) and also had a beer buffet. After three San Miguels, you were put on Buffet which allowed you to drink as much as you wanted for a fixed price. Also had some nice restaurants and live music at the Shangri-La Plaza Mall, next door. An upscale shopping mall with a big food court on the lower floor. Outside several smaller restaurants with a outside live concert during evenings.

Also there is another HUGE mall just adjacent to the hotel which has over 600 shops and a loooong row of small food stalls at the supermarket area. Other than that, I would not recommend Manila as a tourist destination - too much poverty and not much to see, really.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"I stayed at this hotel a couple of weeks ago; and I was very much satisfied. The service, food and the facilities were great. The restaurant selection was terrific.

I stayed at the executive suite and the rooms were just beautiful. I also had a very nice and big view of the City.

My only complaint would probably be the airconditioning. I like my rooms to be very cold. The Shangri-la rooms were cold, but not cold enough (for me). I wish they would allow guests to set their airconditioners to much lower settings.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Check in was quite quick and the hotel staff was even smart enough on their feet to bring me (in the hotel car from the airport) to the garden wing directly rather than to the normal reception due to a traffic problem that would have taken another 20 minutes to drive to the main lobby.

Took a Horizon club room which includes free internet access, breakfast and a HUGE snack in the evening plus drinks for an extra $20 vs the normal rate. Excellent value.

Got a recently rennovated horizon level room (14th floor) which was extremely clean and very nicely fitted out.

Food in the horizon club was excellent, as was the service.

Only problem was the gym. The gym is very complete with Lifefitness treadmills and ellipticals, and nautilus (and other) weight machines. The problem was that it has no air conditioning. Temp in the gym was warmer than outside. Mentioned this to staff several times to no avail. All they could say was that the air con is on... but it clearly wasn't working.

A few other normal developing country issues... a terrible stench invaded our meeting room one afternoon. It was due to some cleaning outside the room. Another morning, the noise level in our meeting room was high - I think due to activation of a standby genset above. These are tolerable if you're having a casual meeting, but one would need to do more preparation for a conference or customer meeting.

Overall I'd recommend this hotel for good service and value, especially if you don't use the gym!",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food
"I loved our stay here. The room was pretty small for three people, but it was clean and comfortable. I was with my parents, yes, I'm an adult, but whatever, so I didn't personally deal with the staff. The breakfast buffet in the restaurant downstairs was AWESOME! I didn't swim, I think people would be horrified by that sight. This is within walking distance to a mall, I forget which one, but when we went for a few minutes we happened to see Manny Pacquio's wife lunching. The lobby is so beautiful. My grandmother had her birthday in one of the ballroom's which was beautiful.",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Location
"I have stayed in Shangri-La hotels before and always been impressed but the service here was even better than usual. This hotel was booked for me by a business associate who booked a 'Horizon club' room. This was about 40-50 dollars more than the normal room but came with lots of extras included. Such as free breakfast in the club lounge, free cocktails and snacks in the evenings, free internet etc. so although almost USD200 per night it was excellent value for money as the only extra I paid for was the airport transfer. The food in the lounge was superb with lobster, crayfish and oysters on offer in the evenings as well as at breakfast. Breakfast also included fillet steak! The bedroom had a wired broadband internet, interactive TV, mini hi-fi and even a HP printer/scanner/copier/fax that you could connect your laptop to. The horizon lounge also had a twelve seater meeting room that you could use FOC for 1-2 hours. Another very nice touch was pre-printed pesonalised stationary including some business cards with your name on them.
The only reason i am not giving five stars is that the room was slightly smaller than I would have expected and the hotel itself is just TOO big! However, i would definately stay there again and definately book the Horizon floor.",Food:Value for money:Comfort & Facilities
"I just returned from a 3-week trip from Manila after 25 years, and I’m so glad that I made the right decision to stay at Edsa Shangri-la. I must say that the Shang has indeed met my expectations. I had a very pleasant experience overall. This hotel should be proud of their courteous and friendly staff. From the waiters, security to their front desk folks – they all made me feel right at home and I certainly felt like a rockstar. :-)

The hotel is situated in the heart of the business district and its easily accessible esp. to public transportation. The way to the hotel is not so pleasant, but it’s a whole different world as soon as you approach the property. The hotel became my escape so to speak after a long day of traffic, heat and Manila chaos.

The hotel is also within walking distance from restaurants, malls etc. There were numerous times I DIDN'T have to leave the area at all.

I am a gym freak and so happy to see that their fitness area is way above average than any other fitness spaces on usual hotels. They have all new equipment, and state of the art (nautilus) facilities. THe fitness area is about a good 4000 sq. ft of space (if not more) plus they offer classes such as Pilates, YOGA, dance etc.

If you are used to the best and only want the best, I highly recommend the Shangrila Manila. You will NOT regret it.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Great hotel in Manila, great free form swimmingpool with enough sunloungers. special childrens pool with slide.
Next to the mall(s), so great for shopping.
Very safe. Very friendly employees. Rooms are clean with good beds.
The breakfast is exceptional good (even fresh sushi) so many choices, and every thing freshly cooked.
Dinner options are good; prices a little high (for example: beef tenderloin $ 22,=)
Everybody is smiling and gives you a feeling like being home.
I booked this with a holiday package of PAL, great deal (you get the included two nights almost for free).",Food:Value for money:Location
"Our family of 4, that included a 2 and 4 year old, used the ""Shang ""as our base during our three week vacation. Staying there that long, catagorized us as Long Stay Guests, which extensively economized the rate, that included a very comprehensive breakfast every morning in a private lounge on the 17th floor, discounts on the property, and a room on the same floor as the presidential suite. The use of the gym facilities and programs were also included in our package.

The property is adjacent to two very large shopping malls, one western style mall with everything under the sun. And the Shangri-La mall with offered exclusive high end labels and a ton of dining options.

I cannot express how accomidating and friendly the staff was, no request was unfulfilled, it was truly like home. We even befriended a few of the staff and my wife played matchmaker. When we retreated to our room every night, there was always a treat of some sort, some nights fruit, others chocolate, nuts or wine, I wasn't sure if this was part of the package or the staff we befriended thought we might enjoy the extra attention. Given the amount of staff/security, I truly felt safe with my children in a foreign country.

It was an oasis to retreat to after full days in the hustle and bustle of the big city. The rooms where average sized, but the linens, towels, and amenities befit the hotel's 4-5 star rating. The rooms were well maintained and clean, turndown service is included every night.

Our stay during the holidays, had the property decorated to the nines with beautiful sculptures, holiday trees, and with live holiday preformers in the lobby lounge every night. Santa was even there to entertain the kids.

The only downside was the popularity of the property with local celeberties and politicals that made the lobby quite busy in the evenings, perhaps this speaks to the first class treatment offered to all guests. It was a 5 star experience at 2-3 star rates, well worth the splurge.",Value for money:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"My husband and I stayed at Edsa Shangrila for about 2 months while my husband was working there.

Its a lovely hotel, the ambience is great, although at that time the coffee shop was still coming up as a result there was a makeshift arrangement in the lobby. The coffee shop was not 24hrs and shut at midnight, but there's 24hrs room service.

True to Shangrila hospitality, the service is amazing and the staff are extremely helpful and always smiling.

The gymnasium and health club is amazing, with great equipment and plenty of fresh qhite towels available, so I spent a lot of hours each day at the gym, sauna, steam room, jacuzzi and swimming pool.

The Mega Mall is just about a 2 mins walk from the Shangrila, as well as the Shangri-La mall which is just beside the hotel too. Both these malls are great, with the famous 'SM' store selling great bargains and some exclusive boutique style shops at the shang palace mall .... Mind you, this hotel is'nt at the heart of Manila (which is the 'Makati' area, which is where the other Shangri la hotel is ... its called the 'Makati Shangri La'), but its convenient in terms of a lot of food places at the nearby malls, live bands, movie halls right next door at Shangrila mall.

The food at this hotel is great! They have a fabulous chinese restaurant - Summer palace and a great Japanese restaurant (I forget the name), also an Italian restaurant called 'Paparazzi' which was very mediocre and quite pricey considering the very limited menu. The coffee shop has a good menu and the 'Hainese Chicken rice' (healthy and tasty), 'Chicken adobo' and 'Crispy Pata' are some delightful filipino dishes I really did enjoy!

The car and limousine service is prompt too, but you need to make sure you specify which service you want, the regular nissans or the 'propah' limousines, considering the 100% cost difference, also make sure you repeat your requirement twice because they're mostly short staffed and tend to forget your request.

The only annoying part of our stay here was the reception, if I never needed to go down to the reception for anything, there were always queues and overworked receptionists who never seemed to stop smiling ....

A small problem for an overall GREAT stay!! Personally if I ever wanted to stay in this part of Manila, I would definitely only stay at the edsa shang ....",Food:Location:Comfort & Facilities
"I was extremely pleasantly surprised by this hotel. The service and room were both excellent. The food, spa treatments and room were an unbelievable value. I would normally expect this type of service/room for prices 2-3x. It's at a Four Seasons quality.

"One of the nicest hotels I have stayed in ever (even by the high Shangri La standards) with superb facilities and restaurants. Unfortunately the city around it has the worst traffic I've ever seen, and the general poverty of the Philippines is obvious. If you're on business in the area, stay here. If it isn't business go somewhere with a better location. As for the shopping mall, I found it a bit depressing as there was nothing that really appealed to a Western consumer ; e.g. 3 month old, second hand magazines.",Location
"Inconvenient. Renovated, but small rooms.,The hotel is located in a terrible place for doing business. The EDSA is a traffic disaster, and it is the only way to access. There are no restaurants nearby. While the food is decent (and expensive) at the hotel, there aren't any other choices around. Rooms are small, but were updated. Most business is in Makati, so plan 45-60 minutes if you are travelling there. It isn't far, but the traffic is terrible.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food
"Not worth the price, staff not approachaeble,Close to shopping malls, close to airport, luxurious,I would not recommend this hotel to my family and friends because staff only prioritize foreigners and not their own. My sister studied Tourism and Management here at United Kingdom and she was the one who stayed at the hotel with my family and she knows quite a lot about hotels. She did not receive a great service she thought she would expect in a five-star hotel! I payed for an extra bed and they got a sofa bed. Staff said all the rooms are fully-booked (which we did not believe at all) and they could not guarantee a room transfer but my sister complained and finally transferred into another room. Staff does not smile at all, and this is very disturbing particularly when they are the face of a luxurious hotel. I had booked for the room and nothing else, but staff expected them to have their meals at the restaurant as my family bought food outside the hotel and brought it at the hotel. Finally, my sister had to check out early due to her flight back to the UK and asked the reception to call for a taxi but they had waited 20 minutes for the taxi. This is not acceptable. We would definitely not recommend this hotel especially to my fellow Filipinos because they only prioritize foreigners.",Staff

The pool area was a welcome respite from the heat of Manila and the buffet at the restaurant was good as we expected at a Shangri-la. There were only two drawbacks with respect to our trip: 1. It is very difficult to obtain a metered taxi at this location. We waited at least 30 minutes each time we requested a taxi. I had dinner once at the hotel in the past and experienced the same problem. 2. The room although clean was worn for a 5 star hotel.

"5 Star Hotel but...,Ambiance,Amazing Location and great 5 star ambiance.I was staying at the Hotel for convience to the particular location in Manila. I enjoy 5 star Hotels when I am pampering myself after long travel or rigerous work. So all of the details one expects make the heafty price tag worth it in a true five star hotel. This location I was comparing to the Sofitel 5 Star in Manila. I stay at Sofitel around the world. They are amazing and never miss a point. Shang was great but they missed the exceptional personal service we grow accustom to at 5 star Hotels. I arrived early to the Hotel and I was accomodated with an early check in. ( Very Nice ). My guest arrived at 7pm and I was meeting her in the lobby lounge. She walked in , not knowing the layout of the hotel. She was never greeted or asked if she could be helped. Although there were many staff at front lobby. They just looked right past her. She stood several minutes waiting to be helped.Finally I rescued her and brought her over myself. The Lobby was not particularly busy. That impression and lack of hospitality hurt the experience. I wont go thrugh every detail of the stay, but first impressions last. The pool bar was attended but the staff never offered service or approached our lounge chairs for a drink or food. I even waived them over and they just kept talking. Finally I got up and went over to order. They seemed very uninterested and very bored. I think the pool bar and hospitality manager needs to have some follow up training there. I am not demanding , but when you pay 10$ USD for a drink some service should come with the price tag. Our meals at the buffet were great! The service good and the food great. The price ok for the experience. The Hotel is beautiful and lavish. Very nice. The live music was great , a string quartet. In closing , we just didnt see the crisp attentive personal service we see at Sofitel. I am sure this can be fixed with a renewed and invigorating Hospitality BOOTCAMP.

Additionally, our room was on the 15th floor and the waiting time for an elevator, in either direction, was ridiculously long. On one day of our stay, an elevator was stopping at every floor and it took until noon to fix (only because a guest notified the staff of the problem despite the fact that there is an Elevator Girl at the Lobby level).

They have lovely tennis courts, yet even if you are guest of the hotel YOU HAVE TO PAY A FEE for using the tennis court (800 pesos). This probably to deter guests not to use the facility and give it to health club paying members.

"It wasn't bad but it could be better.,I booked Makati Shangri-La to impress my husband and kids as it was their first time in the Philippines. I wanted them to experience what a 5-star hotel was like in Manila. I booked for a family of 4 for 4D/3N, 2 adults and 2 children (10 & 6 y/o). So, I was expecting all of us to have the breakfast inclusive of our booking rates. However, only 2 adults have a 'complimentary' breakfast. Our 6 y/o son was free because of his age. I was told that my 10 y/o would be charged 50% of the regular adult breakfast rate. We were obviously upset and this spoilt our first breakfast experience in the hotel. When we checked in, my husband and I clarified with the person who was dealing with our booking that breakfast for the four of us was inclusive. The staff said clearly, it was. My 10 y/o son was not charged for every breakfast he had because he barely ate. This was a gesture of goodwill from the waiter. Every time we came down for breakfast, it was like we were always reminded, we have to pay for the 10 y/o and settle the matter with the front desk later. It was honestly annoying. Food-wise, it was not bad at all. Although, the kids were expecting tocino and other types of longanisa, because of their experience in a 4 star hotel in Palawan where we stayed prior to Makati Shangri-La. It was a surprise and treat that at bedtime, our beds would have been made and prepared for sleeping. Those little touches were lovely. We are not picky. We like to travel as a family. We are adventurous and we had fun in the pool and enjoyed the 12-piece orchestra over the weekend.",Food:Value for money
