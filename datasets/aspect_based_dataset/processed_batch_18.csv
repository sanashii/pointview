"Superb service, beautiful rooms, excellent location,The service was superb. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. The rooms looked beautiful and new. Wifi internet was very fast all over the hotel! Excellent location - within the Ortigas Central Business District. My only concern was the quality of breakfast food in Heat. It was not as impressive I what I expected. But overall, the hotel is worth recommending!",Location:Internet:Staff
"Great value for money,Amenities (next to sm mall). Upgrade to suite. Food.,Got an upgrade to a suite with steam bath jacuzzi and executive study with fax. Room is huge. The only cons were mosquitos and traffic to get to business meetings.

"Great hotel with great staff except breakfast,Friendly service, clean room, reliable/free wifi,Service from the staff was top notch - check in, bringing up luggage, daily room cleanup, and bringing down luggage - all was done with friendly and magnificent service. The only complaint I have was breakfast in the foyer area. We ordered two meals and it took very long to come. After about 20 minutes, we finally asked where our food was and they came out with it. Seemed like we had to ask for them to bring it out. They said they brought it somewhere else, which is equally concerning. The meal was also quite expensive for what we got. I would prefer to dine in Shangri-La Plaza (mall) that's connected to it. However, we did eat at Summer Palace (Chinese restaurant) inside the hotel and had a good experience.",Staff:Food
"New Year Celebration 2016,Food, Location, Room Comfort,It was a very pleasant stay. However, when it was time to go, we were delayed for almost two (2) Hours. We check in on Dec. 31, 2015, we availed of valet service. We check-out past 11 am since my daughter have to work at 12 nn. I gave the parking ticket to the valet counter at almost 11:30am. Since it was new year and there were so many guest,and traffic in front of the hotel is not moving we waited patiently for our car. After 30 minutes my daughter decided to take the taxi so that she will not be late for work, since our car is not delivered to us. At around 12:30pm, I approached the valet attendant to know the status of our car. He told me that one of staff already went to get it.I notice that the traffic is gone,and my fellow drivers waiting for their car were already gone.At 1 pm I approached again the person in charge of valet parking, but he can not give me a definite answer where and when will they deliver my car. That's the time I raise my voice, asking him "" Saan nyo ba pinark ang kotse ko? sa Tagaytay"". Immediately he called one of his staff to assist, the staff ran down the basement and ""Euraka"" in less than 5 minutes my car is in front of me. It was a pleasant stay until that incident involving the valet parking....",Staff

"Would've been a good staycation except..,the Room, the lobby and the food,would have been good except for 2 things - did not allow early check-in and instead wanted to charge us for this, another thing is they are very strict with their pool when we just wanted young kids to be accompanied by us. Clearly some of the swimmers were not guests of the hotel we were and we just exceeded 1 baby/kid and they would not allow that kid to swim. Kindly review your courtesy or courteousness.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Great Hotel - But Not Flexible,Location, Dining, Ambience,I stayed here for 3 nights on a business trip early May 2015. The location was perfect, especially for meetings, food was great as well (Heat and the Japanese Restaurant) and the overall ambience of the hotel was very nice. Was just surprised with how they have this strict rule of the usage of their facilities. I have family in Manila and they wanted to swim in the pool, however the staff told me that only 2 pax were allowed to use the pool per room and the additional ones have to pay USD 50 per pax! I find this to be very ridiculous. It would have been a perfect stay except for that exoerience. Still considering if I will stay here again or not for my next business trip in Manila.",Comfort & Facilities:Location:Food

"Shangri-LA - NAMES SAYS IT ALL!!!!,Attention to detail, location and food,Top notch as always! Staff always helpful, only one member of staff in the reception for the restaurant lacked basic skills in communication (ie telling me when my table would be ready and that she would be the one seating me). but this is an isolated incident. Room was excellent, and after complaining to the duty manager on night one of my stay, they moved me to a higher floor without even asking anything more. Location is excellent. Naturally prices for the hotel restaurant/drinks are higher compared to outside. But its ok if your coming from Europe. It doesnt work out too bad.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"it was the best experience. service at its best.,the service is the gold standard. the bed is confortable. accessibility to the malls,i was visiting my husband and we decided to stay at edsa shang because we both have medical conferences at shangrila (makati and edsa). from the moment i checked in i was treated like a princess. courteous staff.. room was gorgeous and clean. food was divine. one time i have to go to greenbelt and no transportation was available. the head of the concierge overheard a staff telling me the unavailability of the car. he immediately called someone and in 5minutes i have my own transportation. easy as that. if you want to be on a hassle free vacayion, choose a shangrila hotel. money wont matter as long as i get the best. definitely coming back. p.s. please serve cinnamon bread for breakfast. i love cinnamon and its the only flavor missing at the HEAT resto :)",Staff:Food:Location

"Adequate but overpriced.,Location,It seems like you are paying mainly for a huge lobby and a nice garden. The rooms are average. I was disappointed with the restaurants which all seem to close at 10 pm which is not good for an area that has business that primarily operate during the evening. It makes planning business dinners impossible. We went to a buffet that said it closes at 10:30 pm but they promised to keep the buffet open until Midnight. So we sat down at 10:10 pm, had one serving and then they closed the buffet and took the food away at 10:30 pm. I felt I was not told the truth and spent $100 for half a meal and walked out hungry. Also the business office opens late and closes early. Again the Philippines have a lot of businesses that operate at night (call centers) that foreign business people work with and Shangri-La does not appreciate the hours they need to have dinner and access to a business office.",Food:Location:Value for money

They loved the variety and quality of food, the rooms and the attention of the staff...no request no matter how insignificant was left unattended...my only problem was that the pool seemed to small for the number of families that checked in for the weekend...we were mostly local residents who didn't want the hassle of having to fly or drive through long hours....the pool was packed!

Pros: 1.) The best breakfast ever. We ordered the American Breakfast set for 1. We didn't get to finish it. It really is good for 2.5 people, if you ask me. The brewed coffee was exquisite. At P1,000++, very worth it 2.) Service was excellent. Everyone was aware. I didn't want to bother anyone by asking where X place was but someone would approach me quietly and ask if I needed help. Cons: (more like minor inconveniences, really 1.) Weak WiFi signal in other parts of the room except or the desk. Considering the market penetration of portable devices such as tablets and smartphones, I feel that the free WiFi they give to guests should be strong everywhere including the bathroom. Yes, including the bathroom 2.) The air conditioning was way too cold. I wanted an escape from the summer-like December weather we've been having but we were freezing despite the comforter and the fleece blanket we had over ourselves.

On the morning of 22nd of April, at 5am, we were leaving and I walked down the ramp to the street to see if there were any taxis available, which there were. As I went to walk down the ramp the security guard offered me one the hotels cars to go to the airport. I explained that we wanted a taxi as it would be cheaper. He asked if we wanted a metered taxi, to why I replied ""Yes"". He said ""Wait here and I will get one for you."" He yelled to the taxi which we could see in the street, from the hotel entrance doors. The taxi came up and we got in. I asked the taxi driver if the meter was on to which he replied "" No, this is a hotel taxi."" I did not understand this entirely but assumed that it was a hotel courtesy taxi, meaning there would be no charge. When we got to the airport I offered the taxi driver P100 tip. He responded that the taxi cost was actually P600! So, instead of being allowed to walk the 30 meters to the street and getting charged P150 -200 we were charged ~three times the amount. This is very, very disappointing and is what we visitors hear so much about before visiting the Philippines. Tricks to overcharge! This trickery (dishonesty?) was made even more disappointing because it was made by an employee of the hotel.",Staff:Value for money

"Superb,I love the location, the cleanliness and comfort of the rooms, the good food, the amenities - or at least some of them....,1.Quite surprised minibar is no longer available. Sometimes its quite convenient to have some snacks and drinks right at your fingertips to choose from. Especially when youre working on a paper or a report late at night or into the early hours of the morning And of course, I've always paid for what i consumed during checkout. But now, they have removed the minibar and i was told that if i wanted something ill have to order and it would be as good as sold, Something new since i stay for a few days every year at Shang mostly for business but sometimes for leisure and bonding with family. And this is the first time ive encountered this policy. 2. I was attending a convention with my elder daughter as accompanying person. My youngest daughter came to visit me. While waiting for my lecture to finish my daughters decided to go to the gym. These past years they have always been accommodated. After all, i dont use gym facilities- so either a son or daughter was allowed to take my place. So in the past as long as there were just two persons at a time, it was okay with them. But this time they blocked my other daughter from entering the gym. Quite humiliating.. It was only when i came to talk to the gym personnel that they finally agreed. I used to love staying at Shang but somehow, this made me feel uneasy. I don't feel at home anymore. Not really...Sad. The very first time we had short staycations , my children were still in grade school. Now, they're already n Medicine proper .

Get up early and eat at this hotel, or you loose out!!,The rooms are kind of small and ordinary. I thought a ""Deluxe"" room would give me some space to stay in and some deluxe feeling, but nah.. i could have stayed at best western if the room is what is important, and it is for this price. Whats the point in big fancy hallways if the room isnt the same? The service at the hotel is perfect, almost too much cause they even call to confirm everything. But i rather confirm positive on the phone then to wait for poor service other places:) All in all.. I might come back, but not sure. Probably better for buisness-people.
