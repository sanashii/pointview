"Excellent service, beautiful rooms, and wonderful hotel staff! Will definitely go back!,Excellent buffet breakfast at Circles! Comfortable beds! Excellent service from hotel staff! Early check-in and late check-out were accommodated! Quick resolution for minor mishap with credit card charge (Thank you very much, Benjamin and Ms. Angela Asuncion). What I liked about this hotel: 1. I arrived before the rest of my family at around 11AM. They checked and saw that both rooms were already available so they let me check-in early! 2. While checking in, the staff informed me that I got a free upgrade for one of the rooms so that my request for a ‚Äògood view of the city‚Äô can be accommodated. I was highly surprised because I didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd have the capability to do this considering it‚Äôs a holiday and they have a lot of guests! 3. Another wonderful surprise is when I found out that both rooms are interconnected and that we were all on the 27th floor! It allowed us to see the fireworks display in and around the city! The large windows in the rooms allowed for a great city and skyline view (especially at night). 4. The bathrooms were beautiful too! Spacious and clean! I really loved is the fact that I can control the water pressure while showering. It felt like I was being massaged (almost). There was also a large bathtub (which I took full advantage of during my very short stay). 5. The hotel was able to accommodate my request for a full bed for one room (for my parents) and two full beds for the room (for me and two siblings to share; my sister and I took one full bed and my brother took the other one). The beds were so comfortable! 6. The buffet breakfast at Circles the following day was excellent. There was a large selection of dishes to choose from. The service we received at the restaurant was also excellent. We had to pay for one extra buffet breakfast because I booked the two rooms for four people only.,Only one mishap happened and it was after my stay. My credit card was still charged for room service and for the extra buffet breakfast; both of which I already paid for in cash during check out. They resolved it quickly though! (There‚Äôs a 5,000PHP deposit for each room (total of 10,000PHP) which I asked to be placed on my credit card. Given the aforementioned, I still opted to pay in cash for the room service and the extra buffet breakfast. Ms. Angela was the one who assisted me and my mom upon check out. She accommodated my request and assured me that the credit card will not be charged for those. I think it was Friday (Jan. 5, 2018) when I checked my credit card transactions to see if the deposit charge was reversed already. I was glad to see that it didn‚Äôt even go through as the hotel only held it for the duration of my stay. I was surprised though, that an amount of around 1,700PHP+ was charged by Makati Shangrila. I knew immediately that it was for the buffet breakfast and the room service; which I have already paid in cash during check out. I immediately called Makati Shangrila and spoke with Benjamin. I relayed the issue and Benjamin said that he would escalate it to Ms. Angela and that I would get a call back about it afterwards. Ms. Angela Asuncion and I had a long discussion about what happened and she was very apologetic and very understanding!

I arrived a little earlier than standard check-in and was prepared to wait for the room, instead I was very pleased that it was all ready for me ‚Äî this is always a great bonus!! I travelled with partner to celebrate our anniversary and were extremely surprised to have been welcomed to Manila with a cake and a bottle of wine!! The rooms were spacious and the bed was super comfortable. The facilities were amazing; the gym is very big and offered many options for work outs (they run workout classes if you prefer this). The staff were nothing short of welcoming and friendly from the word go!,The location is super central which may take taxis/Uber rides a little longer to get to the hotel due to traffic ‚Äî I would recommend organising with concierge the time you‚Äôd like to get your transport to get you as they have a much better gauge of the traffic in Manila.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Food

"If not for the location I would give this hotel in the future a miss!,We liked the pool area and the location the hotel was in. The entrance was very grand but that was about it.,I think the hotel is quite dated in feel and look. The first room we were given smelt old and moldy which they tried to fix with a humidifier. We were then given a King size bed which was not suitable for a family of 4 with kids over the age of 8yrs old. We had requested two single beds along side the king size. After a few phone calls and a tone of irritation from us they then tried to accommodate us with a better room. It was exactly the same room but on top of one of the higher floors minus the smell. We must say, that after having spent a lot of time and money at the Shangri-La Resort Boracay (which was outstanding!) the Shangri-La Makati was very disappointing in all aspects. After our stay with the hotel we moved on to stay at the Novotel in Singapore and found that our stay and room there was 200% better, than that of the Shangri-La Makati.

Leave the place with my 4 kids already started eating their food? I thought if it's everyday complimentary breakfast it should be everyday? Just make sure to clear this one first before your stay.

Facilities. The facilities were superb especially the health club area. They have a separate room for sauna and steam, and Jacuzzi. The gym equipment is enough to accommodate a number of people and all the staff was accommodating and attentive. Also, I like the idea that you don‚Äôt need to pay for the parking if you‚Äôre a hotel guest. Room: The room is spacious with a humongous bed in the centre. It has enough space for chitchat and a couch beside the bed. They just need to wash the windows from time to time, as you can see molds and dirt all over the windows.,Customer Service: If there was one thing that disappointed me, it was the customer service. First, I indicated on my online request that we needed a twin room, one for my mum and one for myself. To make sure that my request would not be rejected, I called Shangri La three nights before the day to follow up my request. Unfortunately, when we got there, the request was not processed. They promised me to do something about it and what we received was a spare folding bed given to ‚Äúextra‚Äù guests. Also, I was not informed about the benefits of Horizon club guests such as the free afternoon cocktail, late afternoon check-outs among others. I feel hesitated to ask because I was waiting for him to discuss it with me although I know the benefits of a club guest. When he directed me to our suite, that‚Äôs the time I asked him and he simply said yes. No explanation given to me whatsoever. I felt disappointed. I hope Shangri La do something about this.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Food

The guy in the front desk, waited for the other staff to have as fall in line, were in-fact he could have done it by himself as we are not aware on where to queue. The room smells like molds that's why we requested for air purifier or something to spray to get rid of the the moldy odor. The ""suppose to be request"" for our anniversary was set up late. We have checked in already and just went out for a late lunch, and when we got back there was a heart-shaped petals of roses... and nothing else...:-(.
