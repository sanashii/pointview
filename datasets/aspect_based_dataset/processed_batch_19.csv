"Rundown hotel rooms, poor housekeeping staff service ,This hotel needs a major upkeep and maintenance works. For the room rate that I paid - Php12,800/night- the bathroom pipes were clogged, the housekeeping staff took forever to deliver our requests, the carpet is filthy, and no safety handles for PwDs inside the bathroom, except for one on the shower wall. Bath tub is too high for a pwd who has dofficulty climbing. Plus, the twin beds are soooo small. Marriott has better beds and rooms.",Comfort & Facilities:Staff:Cleanliness
"Hotel needs major renovation and accounting system untrustworthy. ,Room furniture (on the horizon club category) needed a major renovation. The sink and bath tub drain were clogged, bathtub needs more safety measures for senior citizens like my mom. Housekeeping is super slow, our request for additional towel never came. Horizon club is ok but little children tended to make a lot of noise and hotel staff seemed helpless in keeping the children behave well. Worst of all, I was double charged for my horizon club room! The POS kept printing out one night and wouldn’t clear out. I had to pay for the room and then later that day I reviewed my receipts and emails and true enough, I was charged twice! I immediately called the front desk at horizon club and thanks to Therese, she quickly solved the problem and reimbursed me in cash. But really, Shang, your accounting system sucks. I wonder how many customers you’ve already double charged because of your bad system? I had expected something more than a return on my excess payment - but none came. :-(",Value for money:Comfort & Facilities:Staff

"Never fail our expectations,I am impressed with the security/medical response team. Firstly, when my skirt got caught on the escalator (though i was the 1 who pushed the stop button). They were kind enough to call our room and check on me, even though it was quite obvious that there was no bodily harm done. Second, there was an accident in the pool area involving one of the minor guest and the emergency team was quick to respond. The staff were all nice (front desk, gym, pool, lounge/bar, the heat, the staff in charge of our room/floor and even the security staff ).

"So so stay,Overall a fairly good Shangrila experience but could be better. We checked in on 24th Dec. The hotel came prepared for long queues at checkin by deploying more people and additional counters in the lower lobby so it was fast. The hotel was jam packed. There were 2 large venues for breakfast but the lines were still very long on both so we opted to have breakfast at the Lobby lounge. The food was too expensive, poorly prepared, and didn’t taste good at all especially the waffles and coffee. The waitress also got our orders wrong several times and seemed like she was new on the job. Not even apologetic. Checkout was also quick but getting the bellman to bring our luggages down to the lobby took an hour! The biggest nightmare though was getting the valet service to bring our car to the hotel entrance. Understandably the hotel was full and everyone was checking out at the same time, but it took about an hour’s wait before we got our car. 😩",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities

The pool area is so relaxing. The bed was comfortable and the room itself is quite spacious.,The service is unremarkable. For a hotel that prides itself as welcoming you like a member of their family, their service is bland and you can feel that people are just there to do their jobs. This is quite disappointing because I always thought of the Shangri-la brand as something premium. The breakfast food at the HEAT buffet was okay. Like the service, it was nothing remarkable. Most importantly, we booked a room at the Shang to celebrate the birthday of my partner. Even if the hotel knows that it was her birthday (she used her rewards card to book the room), there was no effort to extend additional service or even a simple greeting.

We usually have this at HEAT but this time we were asked to go to this make shift/temporary tent, we totally understand that it's a busy season and the hotel was packed, but the quality of food was just ""Not ESML Level"" this time. Didn't even bother to finish my first place because the food was bland and even the usual classic bacon was dry. Like what happened? Anyway, the rest of our stay was perfect, from the lobby lounge and the customer service was always, second to none. Will I come back?

"Beware of lying staff,The hotel is adjacent to the Shangri-La Mall and near Megamall, but the area around it is busy, crowded, and smoggy. Even the window view is dismal. As for the hotel itself, it still looks okay but the signs of aging are very obvious. The walls are thin enough for me to hear the noises from rooms on either side of mine. However, I was most disappointed in their staff for their dishonesty and inefficiency. First, I queued for more than 30 minutes before checking in. I was in line at 215pm and didn't get to the front desk until 245pm. The hotel was undermanned on a busy holiday. That in itself was already disappointing, but things got worse. When it was my turn to check in, the front desk staff handed me the key card to my room at the Garden Wing. I had to interrupt while she was describing the amenities. A Garden Wing room? But I booked a Tower Wing room which is more expensive by a couple of thousand pesos, I said. She said that since I requested a quiet room, the Garden Wing room would be a better option. I couldn't believe she was giving me a room that's cheaper than what I paid for! So I stood my ground. She finally admitted a Tower Wing room wasn't ready yet. Note that I had prepaid my room in full via credit card so I don't understand why they didn't prepare a room for me. Also, based on my previous experiences with other hotels, they upgrade your room and not downgrade it if the one you booked was not available. If they couldn't upgrade you, they give you a voucher for a discount or freebie. Plus you get an upfront explanation, not a deceitful tactic. The staff didn't try to explain to me why my room type was changed until I asked, and when I did ask, she made it seem like being given a lower-priced room was a favor she was doing for me. But I wanted the room I paid for. She said a Tower Wing room would be ready in an hour (4pm) and that I could extend my stay by an extra couple of hours to make up for the hassle. I clarified: Could I check out at 2pm for the",Staff:Value for money

"Overall, good place. Will stay again.,The buffet breakfast at Heat is something you shouldn’t miss. Wide selection although some of the food might have been seating far too long on the counters that they end up being cold already. But still very good, you can ask for a new batch to be cooked, anyway. Another thing is the hotel is directly connected to the Shangrila Mall, so shopping for extra necessities (like swimsuits) wouldn’t be a problem. Along with that, many reviews say that the hotel’s tower wing is quite old looking so we didn’t expect much but it looked quite modern when we arrived, probably because it was renovated recently. Also, I specified in my booking that my friends & I are staying at the hotel for my friend’s late birthday celebration and the hotel was kind enough to send a cute ice cream cake for my friend, simple gesture but definitely appreciated.,We requested for a room with bath but didn’t get a room with bath. Probably because of the availability of the rooms so this is not much of a big deal. They did however fulfill our other requests such as an upper floor room since we’re sensitive to noise. Another thing is the TV’s signal in our room was really bad. No HD channels during our stay.

Needless to say, I wasn't willing to pay for the available room, so I waited forever till I can check-in. No drinks, no nothing to compensate or to help me with the waiting. THE FREAKIN VALLET SERVICE BUMPED MY CAR! When I got home from the hotel, I found a big scratch on my car and the paint job tore up. I immediately called the hotel up and told them one of their drivers damagted their cars, after a half a day of waiting for their response, they call me to said if they can just apply a rubbing compund on my car to hide the scratch.

Located in Ortigas, it's a nice little area for high-end shopping (if you don't want to battle your way down EDSA to Makati) and cut off enough from the rest of the area to be quiet.

"Expensive but safe and reliable,Staff, airport transfer, facilities,I usually stay here when on business in Manila as it is safe and convenient. However I am now looking at other options because of the value for money factor. The hotel is always very crowded especially at breakfast and the buffet is good, but not spectacular. The rooms are good as you would expect but smell musty and I struggled to get the aircon to be cool enough. The pool is nice. The staff are great and extremely helpful.",Comfort & Facilities:Food
"Perfect location, great staff, happy breakfast.,Location because it's connected and in between nice malls, friendly courteous helpful staff everywhere, great breakfast buffet selection. I recommend it especially to tourists who visit our country.,It was a restful, relaxing, great two night stay that startd with a smooth check in by the very friendly and helpful staff at the reception named Nicole. The room was nice. The breakfast before buffet at Heat Resto starts your day perfectly with a wide variety of selection from the buffet, which means you can opt to have different breakfast experience per day to your liking. The pool area is quaint and pretty, however if the pool were heated it would have been perfect to take a dip even on a very cold weather like the day we were there. Was also looking for a steam or sauna area to complement the swim but was told it was still under renovation. Otherwise, this is a perfect place to stay in especially because of its proximity to the nicest malls (it is connected via a bridgeway to my fave mall Shangrila and a few steps away to SM Megamall), that's why i thought if i were a foreigner visiting the country, i see this as a perfect choice of hotel to book. 😊",Food:Comfort & Facilities:Location
"Amazing service,food, gym, staff,The hotel was absolutley amazing! I have never had so good service! Although when i checked out they tried to charge me double for the breakfast although I had already paid for it. The breakfast buffee was really amazing, i wish i could have stayed longer and try more things! its just worth coming to eat here! Really wow! The gym is nice too and open 24 hours, so you can take a really late or early workout :) The pool however closes at 22 already. The internet wifi worked everywhere in the hotel just by joining the wifi, no log-on crap. Very nice! Rooms are nice too but I didnt have a bath tub in my room, only a shower, too bad.

The hotel ambiance is relaxing despite the events taking place (wedding and some birthdays)during our stay. One thing that we truly enjoyed is the room service dining.

"The Service Can be Better,I stayed at EDSA Shangri-La for a conference. The location is very good, considering that Manila has bad traffic jams nowadays, it will be difficult for us to go around to buy things. EDSA Shangri-La is located not very far from the airport, and there is a big SM Mega Mall shopping center just next to it, so you can buy, eat and do window shopping. It's also connected to Shangri-La Plaza, a higher up shopping center. The food in Shangri-La is very good and delicious. I really enjoyed my breakfast, lunch and snack times during conference. However, there were some disappointing points I had during my stay and all were regarding services to the customer. First, no chairs to sit at the lobby. It is a 5 star hotel, so you expect a nice lobby with some sofa and nice chairs to sit while you wait for your guest or taxi. The big sofas at the lobby were not for free. You have to order something from the cafe if you sit at the sofa. When I asked if there were any chair I can sit while waiting for my taxi, the bellboy pointed to a small alley hidden behind the stairs and main lobby and have only 1 set of sofa and 2 single chairs. Not what I pictured in mind of a nice lobby from a very well known 5 star hotel. Second, I stayed for 2 nights with my friend. The first night was under my friend's name and the second night was under my name. We asked for a same room for 2 consecutive nights so we didn't need to move out our things and check in again. On the 2nd day of our stay, nobody clean our room until 5.30 PM. We need to call the cleaning service to send someone. They just easily said that they will send someone to clean the room without even apologizing or gave us reason why they didn't make up our room yet. By the time they arrived to make up the room, we were getting ready to have dinner, we need to take a bath etc. So I just asked for the cleaning guy to just take out the bins and make up the bed briefly. I hope EDSA Shangri-La can improve their service to the cu",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff

He won’t allow the food delivery guy to come in and made us go out in the rain to get our order in a rude way. We are checked in guest there and we were not even assisted with umbrella! Not good.",Staff:Food
"Very good,the hotel staff was helpful. but unlike other hotels, the warmth of the reception is sadly lacking. no water was even offered while waiting for friends who were also checking out. for the breakfast, it was so crowded. the former attentiveness of the staff which i expected based on past experience was again sadly lacking. we were almost done with the meal when we were offered plain water which my daughter wanted. all in all i would say it is a 3.5 rating this time. guess i expected more from edsa shang",Staff:Food:Value for money
"Expensive and in need or a refurb,Not at the standard of the Makati Shang. Terrible traffic in Edsa area. Staff OK. Gym was good. No minibar service in the pool wing area where I stayed. No bar other than the lobby bar. Seems like a place for many locals to just sit and meet so seemed more crowded than a normal hotel should,",Comfort & Facilities:Food:Staff
"One of the best,I want to give praise to all the staff particularly those who handled my booking when I was there, it was so busy, yet they managed to meet my demands with a smile. Location is good, there are plenty shops and restaurant around, you won't go hungry if you are a foodie. And of course, the room, clean, spacious comfortable bed. I would go back again.",Food:Location:Staff

"The HORIZON CLUB of the EDSA Shangrila gave us our best staycation,Your staff ""Len"" offered an upgrade to the HORIZON CLUB. The 14th floor room was excellent-- it was small but the fact that there were only a few rooms on that floor gave it an exclusivity which we appreciated. The additional 3K plus was well worth the comfort, and the food offered by the lounge, though limited in choices, was delicious. The added services of the Horizon Club was certainly was value for money.,I appreciated the fact that there was a fiberfill pillow available in the room. I wanted to use it, however it was too bulky for my neck. I ended up using the flannel blanket as a pillow instead. My daughter woke up with a stuffy nose, probably from the goosedown pillow and comforter. Perhaps a survey prior to check-in of the customers' preference, in case of allergies, would be good.",Comfort & Facilities:Value for money:Food

The Incidental Deposit is the same amount as the total price of the room, it seems that they don't trust their guest asking for that huge incidental charge, unlike in other Hotels they don't ask for incidental deposit or if they do it is not that huge amount We cannot pay online, we hope that we can pay online to minimize the hassle that I can give to their guest",Value for money:Staff
"Staff at check-in counter are very accommodating,I'd like to commed Jowin, the staff who assisted me in our check-in. She's very pleasant, very accommodating, it was a smooth and easy check-in, and she offered us late check-in without any request from my end. Their pool is child-friendly, extended hours until 12mn every Fri and Sat which is great for those who want to hang out later in the pool. The house-keeping are very friendly, they quickly grant requests. You won't realize the hotel is located beside EDSA, I swear. They stand to their hashtag #MyUrbanOasis",Staff
"Tired and very dates hotel... the lobby check-in is likened to a circus or an airport! ,For the money, I think there are better and more value choices in metro Manila. Suggest you look around and don't be comforted by the Shangri-la brand. Its been quite inconsistent in our experience across various markets including Shanghai, Hong Kong, Malaysia and now Manila.",Value for money
"Best hotel,If you need to relax, no need to go out of town. Edsa Shangri-la is the only resort within the city. Love the location, near malls and great place. But the rooms need to renovate or update. The staff is great.",Location:Comfort & Facilities
"Great Family Hotel but Bad Breakfast Buffet,EDSA Shangri-La has been my preferred hotel ever since: I had my wedding first night here with my wife and also spent several special occasions here now that we have kids. The staff service is excellent and are very well-suited when bringing young kids. The pool is great for kids as well and the location is very convenient most especially with the Shangrila Mall and SM Megamall right beside the hotel. Chi Spa is also one of the best spa's in the metro. My only complaint, which has been my complaint ever since, is the quality of the lobby restaurant where they serve breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets. While they hotel is most definitely five-star, the restaurant is most decidedly three-star. And here's why: - The furnishings are worse for wear and are in dire need of replacement or facelift - Availability of food is bad. The bread in the bread section of the breakfast buffet usually does not get refilled when it runs out so try and get your bread asap. Pretty ironic since bread would be the staple for breakfast. - If you're the second group to use a table, do expect that the table setting will not be as complete as the first. Napkins would usually be missing as well as the condiments. - Manpower is surely lacking and while the staff are very courteous and accommodating, service tends to be slow as they are undermanned and overworked. - This also applies to the slowness of buffet food getting refilled most especially during peak hours.",Food:Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"good but they need to make their check in easy ,we know its a peak period and its easter week but they need to make the check in process more efficiently. we waited for 3 whole hours for us to get our room. we arrive around 1pm and immediately check in. we are asked to wait in their lobby for 3 hours while the other people get their room waiting for just half an hour. the family beside us waited only for 20 mins before they got their room to think i have an infant baby with me. they waited for my baby to be cranky before they gave us room. they complimented us with breakfast with this. but still they should have prioritize family with infant. over all my kids were happy with the stay",Staff:Comfort & Facilities
"Excellent,Cons -not really much to say except no hair dryer in the bathroom , should have had a free breakfast for the amount I paid per night, it would have cost more than $300 if breakfast was added. Pros-location was great, not even a 3min walk and you're at SM mega mall. Room was really clean.",Value for money:Food:Comfort & Facilities
"Worst 5 star hotel,I never thought i will experience this in a 5 star hotel. Staff are no help at all. First i had a bad experience with how breakfast was then our second night our room was not clean and requested for toiletries like tissues and towels which took them 2 hours before it was sent to my room and they did that because i was already furious. Next when i checkout left my bag went to call and have it checked manager was not helpful and told me not to accused them it was really upseting. Then they found my bag but all staff that was inside my bag was no longer there . It was the worst service for a 5 star hotel. Will never recommend it and will never stay in that hotel anymore.",Staff:Cleanliness:Value for money
"Our stay was pleasant.,Staff was friendly but not as attentive as staff from other hotels. The elevator had a fishy smell from first day of our stay until check out day.

Even when there were four at a time.",Staff:Comfort & Facilities:Cleanliness

We never sneez inside the room.",Cleanliness:Comfort & Facilities

Nothing was wrong with my previous booking, but upon check out, instead of saving up on Agoda, edsa shang charged me additional 14k for my upgraded room and i wasnt informed abt it.

The gym is excellent.,At the pool, the staff did not walk around and take food/drink orders. I had to walk up to the bar to place orders.
