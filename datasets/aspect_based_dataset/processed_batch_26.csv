"Very restful and luxurious but room service food & menu needs to improve a lot.,soft bed and pillows, spacious, ample lighting, staff were attentive, helpful, courteous and friendly ambience of lobby cafe,ROOM SERVICE NEEDS A MAJOR IMPROVEMENT. Selection was very limited. I stay at the hotel at least once a year for the past 5 years and the room service menu has not changed at all. I wish they added more dishes to choose from. And also, the room service food is not good at all. Two years ago, I ordered pork sinigang. The soup tasted as if it just came from a sinigang mix. And the pork was not tender - it seemed as if it was cooked quickly. On this trip, I ordered the pasta. It had no taste. Adding salt will just make it salty but the taste is still lacking. Very disappointed, especially with the price commanded.",Staff:Food:Comfort & Facilities

"A quality hotel in the heart of Manila.,This was a very nice hotel in a safe and secure part of Manila, a short distance from all the major shopping malls and restaurants. The hotel is very secure with X-ray machines, sniffer dogs, security personnel, card access lifts, CCTV and safe deposit boxes in all rooms as standard. The quality of my room was very good and I was pleased to see a separate bath and shower. The room size was ample and very clean. The breakfast buffet had a number of stations serving many varieties of food and there was even a chef to prepare fruit. Staff were very professional and helpful and when I telephoned the front desk for assistance, a member of staff rang the room bell within minutes to assist. The hotel had a business centre and even had tennis courts which is unusual for Manila. In the front lounge classical musician's were often playing and I very much enjoyed listening to the pianist while having a drink. The hotel is well known in Manila and easy to find, taxi's are right outside within minutes. The price for the hotel was very competitive and included breakfast. For these reasons I recommend this hotel.,Breakfast restaurant was very busy after 9.30am.",Food:Staff

I had a baby so crib and bottle sterilizer was provided for free. Staff were amazing. Plenty of kid's activities during Easter week. Security was everywhere- you feel safe. Pool, Spa and Gym were good. Onsite Hair salon was a joke (prices were sky high- just walk to the mall across the street).,Lobby Café staff took a long time to take our order, bring our order, and come back with our requests.

"Excellent location but beds not as large as on the photo and TAX / VAT per day per transaction,Comfortable, clean, great swimming pool. Truly luxurious.,The fact that the booking.com does not mention that VAT and TAX are calculated per day and not on the total of the stay. Also the website offer had 1 or 2 beds under one offer however when at location we had to pay extra for 2 beds (1 was way too small for family of 4). It should be clear at the booking stage and not give 1 bed option to family of 4. When entering number of people the 1 bed should only be offered to families with kids at cot age not over 3s for example.

It overlooked the city, which, in most days, was busy, but it was eerily quiet and refreshing because of the holidays. The breakfast selection was okay, but not as expansive as the hotel's other property in another part of the city. The pool was a bit small, and felt crowded, but that's because we came in on the peak season, with the hotel at capacity. The lobby was as grand as ever, with the mezzanine cafe offering a classy collection of food, and soothing music. The staff were very friendly and accommodating.

Bed, decoration, lights etc were just perfect. Bathroom is of good size with both shower and tub. Toiletries were ample and good quality. Carpet neat and clean. Breakfast was excellent and wow. There were many varieties of fruits and sweet. We liked local sweets too, especially those cooked with rice, coconut and cassava. Bread section also has good varieties. My favorite cheese types were there with roasted nuts even macedamia. While omelette section is not halal, fried and boiled eggs are as it is cooked seperately. Security was tight at the entrance which made our stay secured.,Nothing. Except the night before we were asked time of checking out and we said between 09.00 to 10.00 hrs in the morning. To our surprise, the keys were blocked at 08.30 hrs before we have checked out and when our bags were still in all three rooms. This is very unlike of Shangri-La. We met front office manager and complained strongly. We informed her that we are coming back again for the night of 30 March and frankly speaking we expected a token of apology like upgrading, better reception, free meal, drink, or better fruit basket in our rooms.

The area is central if you want to stroll around or just use it s a base for short travels as it is near the public transportation hub (MRT, bus and taxi). It is in a safe and busy area of the metropolitan. Restaurants, cafes and shopping mall around it so you have tons of choices. Reservation are simple and consistent and the service staff are excellent people. Interiors of both the common areas and the room we were assigned to are classy, spacious and easy on the eyes. The service staff are knowledgeable and polite and obviously, people-pleaser. I and my children were always plesantly surprised whenever we were in the lobby, at any given time you are met with a very subtle and clean smell reminiscent of baby powder--- we really loved it! The breakfast at Circles offers enormous choices and was very good for my picky eater-kids. It has a small but good size swimming pool when the day becomes too warm for you. The rooms are very clean and the bed is superb. The price is on the high end but it is worth every penny, real value-for-money if I may say so.

"Make sure you double check on what you're paying for.,The area is great if it's your 1st time visiting. Lots of shopping malls, the facilities are nice as well.,Came across a problem / miscommunication with a frontdesk staff. 1st time at this hotel especially in Philippines.1st of all I Had an original booking booked w/ booking.com which cost only $900+. Although an upgrade was offered to us only for a late checkout which sounded nice at the time. From the poor explanation I only understood that an extra $140 (7000php) was being added on top of my original booking. Wasn't informed that the booking was going to be cancelled and put on a new rate upgrade w/ an extra room and all those nice things. I wasn't given a balance of how much I'll be paying later etc.. upon check out saw the expensive bill surprised and just spoke to the mod (manager on duty) and got things settled... the mod was kind enough to give us some discount although it still was an expensive bill. The facilities, staff was nice the experience was great but I do believe that they REALLY need to work more on helping their guest understand more of what they're offering or selling to them if this isn't fixed I'd say that they would be very misleading and probably not recommend their hotel at all to any future friends/family that would visit Manila for vacation.",Staff:Value for money
