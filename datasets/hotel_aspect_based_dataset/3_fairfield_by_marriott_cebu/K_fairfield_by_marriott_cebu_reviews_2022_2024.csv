1708938205,"Modern newly built hotel with practical minimalist design. Very fast Wifi and USB ready sockets in various areas of the room. I was able to work in my room very comfortably. 

Room was clean with typical hotel amenities except body lotion - not a big deal, just bring your own!

Buffet breakfast offered many choices including cook to order omelettes, congee, fruit juice, and coffee selections.

Location - while I may prefer to stay in hotels that are adjacent to malls, I could not complain about this hotel’s location in the middle of Mandaue. Parking is easy and since you drive inside the hotel compound to get out of the car, I felt very safe. It was easy to get transportation via Grab at the time of my stay. 

Staff was friendly and accommodating.

They are the friendliest, happiest staff we have ever experienced. Period. Their smiles are from ear-to-ear and all they want to do is make you happy and have a great day. Wow! Kudos to the team, best wishes for great success and thank you for a great stay. 

P.S. For U.S. travelers, The Fairfield brand in the Philippines and Asia is much more high end than the brand in the U.S. Definitely a 4-star hotel.",5.0,2024-01-12
