Warm hot breakfast is offered with omelette options at a very reasonable price. The highlight is if you ask for a capuchino my oh my will you be served a beautiful message in your coffee. It was incredible to be able to get this for a few days. It was the highlight of my morning everyday, a beautiful positive message in my coffee!

Philip is to be acknowleged for making my stay so sweet. He assisted me in every request I had and arranged for in room massages also mani/pedi at a local place meeting my standards he is very well knowledged and provides outstanding customer service. Thank you for making our stay so incredible and unforgettable!!

I loved how this property was centrally localized between Mactan and Cebu City so I was in the middle and could go anywhere within a short $5 Grab ride.

Thanks again for the incredible Philippino hospitality!!",5,2024-05-18

934189724,"Visited the Philippines in December. This property opened on 1st Dec 

Nice spacious rooms. More importantly very clean. 

Staf super super friendly. Took care of us like family. Being a Vegetarian I had limited options but they were happy to give me my choice of food as I had to just talk to the Chef. Ramen for the win !

The front desk takes extra care of you. They helped us to find the perfect places to visit for nightlife and if we wanted to have a meal outside. This building located in Manduae. Has a pool . The Breakfast buffet was sumptuous. Highly recommend
