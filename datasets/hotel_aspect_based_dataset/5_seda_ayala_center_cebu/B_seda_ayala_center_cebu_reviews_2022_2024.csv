 Standard cheap ""Filipino hotel"" buffet. Who has baked beans for breakfast? Canned corned beef hash soooo salty. Being an ex-line cook, I had to teach the cook on eggs how to make a proper omelet. TWO days in a row! 

The stated 24/7 valet parking doesn't exist. At all. But they sent a bellhop with me in car to take me to parking. Which is a 1km drive to end up 45 secs walk from elevators. But do to the limited parking available I didn't leave until departure. Which was not in our plans. We wanted to go to a couple places and didn't because of no valet.

 The service provided from security to door-persons to bell hops to concierges to one specific front desk lady(Steph) to all housekeeping who serviced our rooms.  All very service oriented.
 One front office did not check properly that our room has been fully paid and called me back after I checked out saying that there is still half of the bill unpaid.  It was embarrassing as I even paid for my laundry bill the day prior we were to check out to prevent any delays and hassle during check out date.  I had to remind the lady that I paid for 50% deposit way ahead of time when she was saying that I only paid for half when my card was swiped during check in date when it was actually charged for full balance payment upon checking in time.   She appeared to even doubt what I was saying and I was on the verge of opening my email and scrolling to locate my email thread with my deposit payment proof then she said let me check again.  She should have been thorough before putting a guest in an unnecessary embarrassing situation.  It would be good that front desk staff are trained to check before chasing a client and saying ‚Äúhindi pa po kayo bayad.‚Äù  The person she asked to run after me was nahihiya somehow to say it kasi nga nakakahiya nga naman if it were true.  Rather than ruin my day, I just had to keep calm.

Further, when I had queries right after using the Bookings app and called in for room verifications versus the description stated on the app, Seda front desk canNOT answer queries properly.  There seemed to be a lack of knowledge as to their rooms‚Äô features.  How can they sell the rooms if they do not even know what to answer.  I had to ask the reservations person to at least go to the rooms and revert after inspecting the rooms.  They just kept insisting that the powder room/guest bathroom is a piece of mirror which boggled me.  As I have never come across a powder room that does not have a lavatory and a water closet.  Thankfully, the person in the end after quite a bit of discussion agreed to do an ocular of the room I was verifying and called me back to confirm that what was described in Bookings app is wrong and I had to make an upgrade instead.",10.0,2024-02-07T16:25:01+07:00

 Well, the hotel is outdated . Needs renovation, and the pictures don't reflect reality
. Never the less they maintain it quite well. 
But the noise from the traffic easily gets inside the room, especially at night you want to sleep. 
This is due to old alumimiums with the  single.glrass layer. Also, there is a new construction going on next to the hotel that makes the noise situation even worse. 
The internal soundproof simple doesn't exist. You can listen to everyone speaking  next room easily..

 If you have kids and want to visit places like cebu ocean park, anjo's world, or cebu safari, expect a bit of travel time from those places. But, if you just want a place in the center, this place is the best.",10.0,2024-01-19T08:24:27+07:00

 The first room I was assigned to, had a mildewy odor coming out of the AC. The toilet smelled of urine, which the staff addressed when I reported it to them. The 3rd floor hallway carpeting needs changed. Part of the main lobby ceiling wallpaper was lifted or detached. From the outside, the shingle roof needs pressure cleaning, because of mildew or mold.

 Location
 Check in was so bad our rooms was not ready and it was already 6 PM. I was still asked to be charged for club access when its already past 6 which didn‚Äôt even get to enjoy the benefit at night time. No compensation and no apology. I have specifically asked for a twin room and was not given upon check in. Also standard is usually not letting anyone check in when the person who booked isn‚Äôt present. Not worth the value, the only staff who was friendly was the club access.  Rooms are outdated, bathroom small and there‚Äôs no ventilation. Shelf in the bathroom is broken.",3.0,2023-10-16T15:05:00+07:00

 I've stayed at this hotel a number of times before. It's a reasonably good hotel. Most staff are friendly and some are just extremely rude. The ""gentleman"" who works at the little lobby bar stand and mixers the cocktails, he need to fired to save the hotels reputation.  Additional training won't help this man.  He's got a problem with western men who date Filipino women and makes it very obvious. I got thick skin so if he managed to work me up its pretty bad.

 NO DRESS CODE!  It is imperative to have a dress code  posted  on the main entrance of the dining area, especially  during breakfast hours.   I have seen  male guest walking in with his sleeveless shirt and exposing his underarm when reaching for  the food buffet.

 Everything! I loved the Seda Ayala Cebu. I miss the comfortable beds, the fast wifi, the nice bathroom with hot showers, and I really miss the breakfast; I miss having all the hashbrowns, pork, beef, fruits, nice hot coffee, pancakes, etc. I really also loved the gym; Oh my god, their gym is the best! It's so big and complete. You can easily spend 2 hours there. The pool area was also really beautiful with nice ambience and music. You can't beat the location of the Seda Cebu; It's right across the mall and to all the nice cafes of Cebu including Abaca. And the staff were so polite and professional, will highly recommend this place!

 If you‚Äôre booking for someone else (e.g. my parents in my case) be prepared to sign an ‚Äúauthorization form.‚Äù They want the original card used for the booking to be presented in the check-in counter, in my case it was impossible. I have to pursue an international call (I reside in the UK) so that they would understand that I couldn‚Äôt present my card for the booking. The staff was very swift in sending me the form that needs to be filled up, attached together with my scan copy of my pertinent card details and a valid Philippine ID. It‚Äôs such a hassle to do all these tick boxes as I have not encountered this circumstance.

The business lounge dining room offered a good breakfast, afternoon snacks at 2pm and drinks and snacks from 5 pm.
 There is construction work on the road alongside Seda. The hammering goes from 7am to 8pm 7days a week. Some of the noise is muffled by the windows but not all. The in room dining menu described a pork and vegetable Pancit. I ordered it and it came with shrimp which I'm allergic to. The kitchen staff should always ask regarding allergies.

 The hotel is literally a few steps away from Ayala Center Mall. The staff were courteous and polite and the breakfast selection was excellent.
 The front desk was understaffed. There were only two staff manning the counters for both checking in and out as well as for other concerns. There were no bathrobes which is usually available at hotels within this price range. The towels were particularly old, darkened, and hard from repeated use. And the bathroom amenities were certainly not at par either. The lobby has this annoying loud music which were neither calming nor pleasant.

 Great location. Ayala Center's just a few steps away. Staff were really courteous and friendly. Also, the Dining area staff (Misto) were attentive. Great food choices for breakfast too. My favorites were the budbud and puto paired with a smooth drop of ""Tableya"". Check in and check out process were quick and smooth. Stayed in one of their junior suites, air condition was working well and the wifi was strong too. Love the space and the shower plus you can access the Club Lounge on the 12th floor on specified times for breakfast, afternoon bites and cocktails. It was a lovely stay. Will definitely come back.

The doormen calls taxi for you, and when you arrive in a car they ask if you have luggage at the back and they immediately take them for you, and they also check inside the taxi if in case you left anything. The gym was good. Breakfast was good though I would prefer to have more Filipino dishes as they were very limited.

Location was great! Very close to ayala, IT Park, restaurants, cafes, etc.
 Filipino dishes in their breakfast menu were limited. They have more western foods.

The windows should be cleaned, our view was supposed to be good but it was hard to appreciate it when the window was in dire need of cleaning.

A bit of upkeep would be necessary in their rooms.",8.0,2022-10-19T05:32:28+07:00

 stayed there for 8 nights.

pros:
- the location: it's near Ayala shopping mall, a lot of taxis and drivers know where it is.
- the staff is very friendly and always try to accommodage requests
- they have healthy meals which is great for those with dietary restrictions
- love the breakfast buffet
- fast wifi. my work is zoom-heavy and I was able to work without any internet issues
 cons:
- DUSTY! the room at first glance looks clean, but the corners and under the furniture are dusty, and the a/c is dusty too- it looks way overdue for a deep clean
- staff can be slow, especially in the restaurant, maybe they're understaffed? 
- the breakfast buffet is worth the price. lunch was consistenly the worst- with presentation, taste, and portions lacking. 
- dinner buffet is mediocre. don't go an hour before it closes, the meats are dry and bard, everything has been overcooked because of the warmer and lights.",8.0,2022-09-12T15:10:18+07:00

 Very professional staff at check-in (quick, uncomplicated, friendly)
 below average for a 5 star hotel. many hot dishes were cold or lukewarm. The choice of cold cuts, bread, cheese is very limited. The location is perfect, there is only one big minus the staff at the entrance. No friendly welcome to bad and incorrect information about the really poorly signposted parking situation.",8.0,2022-03-05T02:13:41+07:00

 the room was quite big, bed comfortable. the catering staff were very pleasant and super nice each time they brought in food to the room, even giving me options not on the set menu. I sometimes asked them a favor to tell Reception to answer their phone. throughout my quarantine stay of 8 days despite the devastating effect of typhoon Odette electricity and air conditioning were available, water for shower and internet connection also (though we had 2 separate days without internet). no TV/cable after typhoon but didn‚Äôt bother me.
 limited information from Reception at time of checking in. asked for security deposit, gave me their inclusive menu, and showed me to my quarantine room. it got worst after typhoon Odette hit Cebu everything was a mess, phone kept on ringing for ages. and if answered, either I was put on hold or can‚Äôt give me any assurance about the delay in my PCR swab, considering the hotel was classified as Multi-purpose Quarantine Hotel they weren‚Äôt helpful and can be very frustrating. suffice to say, my quarantine stay was extended and stayed 8 days in total. being a ROF I had to pay for everything myself. I was glad I arrived home just before Christmas eve. I‚Äôm sure It would have been a better experience otherwise, it was just unfortunate a big typhoon happened.",8.0,2022-01-17T10:05:13+07:00

 I stayed at SEDA Ayala Center Cebu to do my mandatory hotel quarantine. I availed their quarantine package which included 5 nights stay, full board meals (3x a day) and airport pick-up. Everything was seamless and very professional, the room was spacious, had enough light, and was very pleasant. The food was really good, they even ask you for your preferred next meal if you are picky; the servings were also enough. 

I especially appreciated their hospitality. On the day of my check-out, the test results were released very late and I couldn't check-out by noon. They let me stay in the room til 6PM for free, or until I got my test results.
 The check-in process was kind of slow as there was only 1 person attending.",9.0,2022-01-10T02:35:35+07:00

 I liked the location, it was perfect considering that it was adjacent to Ayala Mall. There was enough parking space as well. I also liked the staff that welcomed us, specially the bell boys. They were courteous and cheerful, which set our mood for the day.
 I didn't like the staff in the restaurant. There were particular persons I vividly remember who were impolite. While my husband was having his coffee, he stood for a while to get something and this man came and got hold of his cup to dish it out without even asking. This happened over breakfast, which is quite an important time of the day. I understand that attitude is subjective but this was a hotel, and human relations is quite a big deal.",5.0,2022-01-07T01:57:17+07:00
