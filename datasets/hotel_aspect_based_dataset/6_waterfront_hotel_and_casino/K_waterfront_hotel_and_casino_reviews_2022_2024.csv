12053140,"The first thing I noticed was the negative vibes at the reception during check in. This Sheryl or Sherry who is a supervisor according to her name tag couldn't maintain her customer service attitude to save her life. This girl was condescending AF. She kept interrupting me, spoke so fast and kept giving abrupt answers. She had a funny look on her face when I told her I don't have a credit card when she ask for a cc to charge a deposit. I gave her my debit card and she declined it in a condescending way then proceeded to tell me I can use cash. this B could have offered that as an option in the first place. Also, she has this funny look when she gave me my key. I should've known there was something wrong with thr room. I found a leaf on the dresser?! it seems they only do light cleaning. the baby keeps sneezing as the room seems a bit dusty. the air-conditioning was worse than a fan as it couldn't keep the room cool and it keeps making noises. We tried calling the service center and we were on indefinite wait until the line drops. we kept calling till we gave up and resumed in the morning. we finally got someone when we tried calling housekeeping line and the promised to send us someone. we waited for more than an hour for that person to arrive then confirm that the AC is busted and we had to transfer rooms. which was totally useless as we had somewhere to go and had to check out early. the hotel refused to compensate for this because its an online booking. also there was a ball and a lot of people was there to party which caused traffic in the elevators. they had 2 areas with 4 elevators and only 3 out 4 elevators are functioning. we asked if we could take the stairs going to the 3rd floor, they don't have it. I feel like the hotel is overrated. what I find satisfactory: the bellhop, all people at the restaurant when I had my breakfast, the breakfast buffet offerings and the girl greeting at the door was super polite and pleasant.",1.0,2024-05-29

9765784,Perfect for big events and parties but the hotel room needs upgrading or renovation perhaps. We stayed overnight for a friendâ€™s year-end party however the air-conditioning unit was not working properly. Had someone checked the unit but was told that they had issues with their tower (idk) and all and should work eventually but it didnâ€™t.,2.0,2023-12-18
9502513,"We were not able to continue our stay because we felt discriminated. The security followed us wherever we go, we felt like we are suspected of something. Visitors were required to pay Php 1000 just to visit you. So we moved to another hotel. Worst policy ever! No wonder why their hotel is becoming overshadowed by other hotel despite its grandeuristic looks!",2.5,2023-11-06
