 Breakfast was pretty much above average. My family enjoyed most of what is on the buffet selection. Of course the ladies staff at the resto who was always accommodating to our needs.
Location was pretty close to the airport. 
The most that impress me was the front desk service, excellent one!! Special mention to Michael and of course the rest of the crew who was there to assist us. ( An incident happened after our check out and found out I forgot my double ring in the bathroom, to roll the story forward. Glad to get my ring back after calling the reception about the situation!!!) Two thumbs Up!!!

 Our experience here was exceptional, and we thoroughly enjoyed  our stay. The accommodations were comfortable and well-appointed, making us feel right at home. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, ensuring that all our needs were met promptly and with a smile.

The location of this place was particularly impressive. Situated in a convenient and picturesque area, it provided easy access to local attractions, dining options, and scenic spots. We loved exploring the surroundings and found it to be the perfect base for our adventures.

Without a doubt, we will be returning to this wonderful place. It met our expectations apart, and we are already looking forward to our next visit.

 PROS: Pool area was so nice, room was great, everything was perfect. The elevator didn't take forever. I had had a very bad experience at another hotel that I initially booked, which was a scary experience for me so I came here last minute knowing that it would be quite the opposite. So thank you for helping me out here! The lunch and dinner options were super great.
 CONS: Ok this is more personal preference, so please take it as one person's opinion. I would have liked to just be called by my name and not ""ma'am"" constantly. I know this is a 5 star experience, so it is to be expected. Though I was referred to as ""ma'am"" only in the Philippines and not just at this hotel (traveled to 3 other SE Asian countries and they treated me normal) and it just felt like it created an uncomfortable divide. 

I was even asked if I preferred to be called just my name, which I said ""yes"" to and then was immediately called ""ma'am"" again by that same staff. I do not need to be treated like royalty, but again I understand that this is a 5 star hotel so it is possible many prefer that treatment here. I just think it is good to ask first for preference from guest and then actually listen to their answer.

Cook food a bit more; I had an omelet was undercooked. I did have eggs at another place in the Philippines which were also undercooked, so maybe that is normal here - not sure! But otherwise the food was super excellent!",10.0,2024-05-17T19:24:08+07:00

 Newly built hotel and very modern. The staff were very attentive and couldn’t do more to help you out.  It was very clean with a very good breakfast buffet. They have a swimming pool at the roof which is also very nice. We ordered room service on our last day and the restaurant food is amazing! The shower was the best we had during our 2 weeks in Philippines. We miss this hotel and its team! I now know why the song goes ‘I love Cebu’.
 The toilet was not a full separation from the room, there was sliding door type of installation of bathroom and bed area. The sliding door only reached to the bench area therefore not fully enclosed. We managed to get around this by always having the AC on!

 It is a pretty new property with good overall ambience and facilities. The rooms are uniquely designed and have some really good elements to it.

They tried to accommodate us with whatever best they could in terms of going out of their way to provide us with vegetarian food.
 The rooms were a bit small and thus they had a different design to it. The toilet area and handwash was kind of part of the room as it wasn’t gated.",9.0,2024-01-19T00:45:52+07:00

The shower was the best we had during our 2 weeks in Philippines. We miss this hotel and its team! I now know why the song goes ‘I love Cebu’.
 The toilet was not a full separation from the room, there was sliding door type of installation of bathroom and bed area. The sliding door only reached to the bench area therefore not fully enclosed. We managed to get around this by always having the AC on! It didn’t retract from our amazing stay.",10.0,2024-01-29T08:12:18+07:00

 The most comfortable shower of all the hotels I have stayed in Cebu
Even if it is difficult to book a taxi during an important festival, the service staff try their best to solve the problem and make people feel very safe.
 No new toothbrushes were left after cleaning the next day, although perhaps because of environmental reasons, the toothbrushes you provided were disposable.
No restaurant options nearby, even 711 is a 500 meter walk.",9.0,2024-01-23T15:13:24+07:00

 It is a pretty new property with good overall ambience and facilities. The rooms are uniquely designed and have some really good elements to it.

They tried to accommodate us with whatever best they could in terms of going out of their way to provide us with vegetarian food.
 The rooms were a bit small and thus they had a different design to it. The toilet area and handwash was kind of part of the room as it wasn’t gated.",9.0,2024-01-19T00:45:52+07:00
