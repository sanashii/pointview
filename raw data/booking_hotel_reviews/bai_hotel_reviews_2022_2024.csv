 Breakfast was insane. The hotel is so big that breakfast becomes really crowded and so we couldn't even sit in the main dining room.

The WiFi was unusably slow.

 The breakfast and the hotel decor was nice & clean, The initial room had a bad odor and we requested a different room. Our request was honored. Also, It  is my understanding that on your initial entry into your room at a three to five star hotel a staff person will escort you to your room along with your luggage and provide a brief introduction to the room pointing out the various amenities and qualities of said room. An opportunity for the hotel to feature their reason why their hotel is worthy of their status. An opportunity to ""BRAG"" about their hotel. This hotel provided none of these qualities of  behavior in this regard.  However after the initial failures , the following stay at this hotel was professional, exemplary, helpful, and all around wonderful. From the cleaning ladies/staff to the front desk, to the entire breakfast crew,  the door men, to security. They were all exceptional. Using a baseball metaphor: ""They knocked it out of the park"".  I would recommend this hotel to all of my acquaintances & friends. However not my enemies. This hotel is much too good for stupidity. Respectfully

 The description on the App did not match what the Hotel offered. I have paid an additional 800 pesos for an ""upgrade"" as offered in the App and after the upgrade, it stated that I will have a ""double room"". When I checked in, the staff explained that the upgrade was for a higher floor and complete facilities. I was thankful to the staff who clarified the issue but I am disappointed in the App for it is misleading.

 The Bai Hotel was beautiful and the food we had was excellent. We ate twice at the rooftop pool area, once in the evening and once in the afternoon, and both were great experiences, with delicious food in a beautiful environment with an amazing 360 view of Cebu. It is very convenient to have late-night dining options at the hotel. The rooms are well designed with a contemporary and fresh look, and the lobby of the hotel provides an extremely impressive first impression. I stayed at another quality hotel in Cebu previously at about the same price, but the Bai was much nicer and we will stay there again on our next visit.
 The only negative about the Bai is that the location is not central to many shopping and restaurant options within walking distance, but there are plenty of options only a short cab ride away.",10.0,2024-03-20T13:57:47+07:00

 I checked into this hotel today and the air conditioning in the room was broken. It was below 20 degrees the whole time. I waited there for 3.5 hours from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and it couldn't be repaired and I couldn't get an equivalent room. I was offered a much smaller room and I wanted the price difference, but was also rejected. I didn't get a refund for the room either and so I checked out of the hotel. I didn't use anything in the room I booked and just waited there. It was zero service. Never again.

We ate both at their breakfast buffet, their marble + grain restaurant, and ordered some room service for lunch. It was all great tasting and well prepared.

They also take security very seriously. They check everyone who enters the hotel, so we felt very safe.

We also received a free room upgrade, which we didn't expect, but was very much appreciated.

 The true value of this property is in it‚Äôs amazing staff..  from the security staff, to the concierge.. to the servers, the cleaners, everyone has a smile on their face, everyone makes you feel absolutely welcome..  I have never been treated so good at any resort in the world. I almost don‚Äôt like to single to staff members out because they are also incredible. But Vince and Venus went above and beyond, even though they are on a team of complete Rockstars. I appreciate both of them very much.
 The only thing I did not like about the property was with pillows, many of these hotels are moving towards these type of pillows that feel like they have air in them.. they are soft to the touch, but in my opinion, difficult to sleep on. My neck sore for 24 hours. I called to see if they had some different type of pillows. Housekeeping immediately requested to come and change them all, but I asked them if they are different or the same. And they told me all pillows are the same. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal for most people, but I can tell you that my jacket wrapped up in a towel was more comfortable than these pillows. Management needs to change them immediately. I would‚Äôve continued to stay at this hotel if it was not for this. I will come back, but only because of the staff. I will obviously have to bring my own pillow.",8.0,2023-11-19T00:00:49+07:00

 Lack of customer service and sincerity with management following through and taking feedback in a positive manner and an opportunity to improve.

 Hidden charges!!  We had 2 cocktails and 2 dinners for room service, it was supposed to be around 1400php. When checking out the amount to pay was suddenly 2200. They charged us ""dinner tax, pool tax etc"". WhT for note sure as previous hotels have not done this and we were not aware there was extra fees to use the pool. Breakfast was big however my friend and me are not too hungry in the morning so we asked to just take 2 croissants from the buffet up to our room to eat later, but that wasn't possible.

 Our stay in this hotel serves as our 1st honeymoon with my husband, and since this was the 1st day we meet again because both of us are working abroad, we were looking for a really nice hotel. I have a lot of friends in cebu and most of them recommended Bai hotel. And indeed, we had a really amazing and great time staying in this hotel. We were so lucky that the receptionist gave us an upgrade of the room from deluxe twin room to a king sized bedroom! We were so happy and excited. The room was really elegant and big with a beautiful city view at night. The breakfast buffet was magnificent. We all like the menu served and the time they gave from 6am to 10am is very nice specially for us who don't like to wake up early for the free breakfast. The swimming pool experience was also great and romantic. All of the staff we encountered were very polite, helpful and approachable. All in all, the experience we had was really amazing üíØ. Surely we will stay again in this hotel once we get back to cebu. Highly recommended üëç

 The facilities were fantastic. The shops are convenient. The lounge was great. Loved the caf√©. The buffet was very good.
 The rooftop Twilight bar. Oppressive heat and no fans, the barstools were uncomfortable for me being a large foreigner, and the rush to order drinks forced me to ask for a suggestion. I was told the Mai Tai is ""salable."" It was overwhelmingly bitter and was not my kind of drink. I instantly regretted it and wish I had been given more time to order. I stood almost the entire time and didn't take but a few sips. Once I was covered in sweat, we just paid the bill and left. Probably won't visit it again if we return. But the rest of the hotel was fantastic. Wish I would've given the money as tip rather than waste it on a drink I couldn't drink.",9.0,2023-04-22T15:14:32+07:00

 nothing much, it was a frustrating and disappointing night stay...
only entrance gate staffs are friendly, others really need retraining..
the hotel near to a small shopping mall that full of restaurants..
Walking distance to eating place around 5 to 10 mins...
 The breakfast foods are not hot, being offered to serve coffee but never delivered...
The checking in and out process took long time..
Receipt only available after request..
Room condition need lots of improvements, wall cushion got mould /water stains, floor full with scratches, dusty chair, door got mould stain, toilet wall got red colour stains and old & broken tissue box.
The initial room given has aircon condensation issue which leads to serious water dripping issue at bathroom.
Requested for room change but the whole process was length and not being handled well.
Going up n down the floors several times due to the replacement room key lock malfunction issue, even the manager's universal key also unable to unlock the door.
The front desk staffs really need re-training, not friendly at all, working speed is slow..

 Highly likely that it was my fault, but my booking did not include breakfast. The one thing that did bother me was that a discount voucher was offered to my cousins who were booking at the same time as I was but not to me. There needs to be a consistent and standard approach to this.
 The halls smelled a bit weird to me. I've been to hotels that smelled better. My room also smelled a bit moldy but I didn't see any mold whatsoever.

Also, what is up with the metal detectors?! It was such a hassle going in and out of the hotel! I understand safety but a hotel having metal detectors is more concerning to me than a hotel that doesn't have metal detectors.",8.0,2023-04-19T02:33:39+07:00

 One of the worst experiences so far in a hotel in the Philippines.  Our room was surrounded by a sports team maybe?  Kids and teenagers were partying in the halls drinking all night.  Calls to the front desk went unanswered until 7AM when someone finally answered.

 Room is quiet
Food orders are prompt and delivered well
Check-in staff are polite and friendly
Great location for most places in Cebu
 - Hotel baggage staff moved my belongings into secret room, which I had to go into to get another credit card, and then found one of the staff going through my bags!
- Hotel has gone down hill (as with all hotels in Cebu area sadly) as foreign tourists are still very scarce.
- Too overcrowded with local guests taking up the rooms (amazed to see how the locals can afford to stay there the same as me)
- With near full occupancy you have to wait several minutes before a lift is ready to move you between floors
- Breakfast time in the restaurant is extremely noisy and very long queues to wait for mainly local focused cuisine (not nice food)
- Room was in poor state, dirty floors, dirty windows with bird excrement and had not been cleaned for a long time
- Difficult to call reception at times
- Check-in is a long battle (though the staff are friendly), it takes them a very long time to program their computer and a lot of paperwork to have to read and sign before you can get your keys
- No Express Check-in or Check-out facility
- Deposit in cash required, or if taken by card can take two months to be credited back
- No hotel liability if room safe is stolen or things in the room go missing (you have to sign a waiver on arrival)
- Entering hotel is slow, as security guard outside does a ceremony walk around car with angled mirror, but doesn't actually look at the mirror.  All bags are screened like airport security, just takes time with lots of bags.
- Chairs in room make it difficult to walk around the entire bed.
- Shower floor has moving grip tape
- Photos look nothing like the actual room
- Room cleaners knock often to check to clean the room
- Water feature in square outside not working (or not switched on)
- Main foyer downstairs over crowded (seemed like a wedding was taking place there)
- Bedroom lights confusing to operate - two glaringly bright lights over the bed
- Bathroom sink plug was closed and difficult to open
- Toilet seat at an angle
- Small rooms",2.0,2023-03-20T08:26:53+07:00

Hotel also has a small rooftop pool and 4 restaurants in case you want to have staycation like we did on our last night (pretty close to Cebu Int Airport).Tried also their gym and was offering enough equipments and free weights in its small zone.
 We would have wished that the reception told us about ‚Äôdress code‚Äô on the breakfast; men are not allowed in the restaurant in sleevless shirts. We didn‚Äôt mind the dress code but informing before waiting ages the ‚Äôtraffic hour‚Äô elevator to go back to 17th floor and back to 2nd was frustrating.

 The hotel is modern clean and comfortable. The roof offers great views over the city and access to two pools! The room was spacious and very comfortable. The proximity to the airport is helpful too and was the main reason I booked a night here.
 The only negative thing was that when I enquired about organising a transfer to the airport the concierge quoted me 1400 pesos for what would have been a 20 minute journey. I politely declined as this was far too much. He then reduced the amount to 900. I ended up booking a taxi with Grab and it cost me less than 300 pesos.",8.0,2022-12-01T02:57:13+07:00

 The bathroom which doesn‚Äôt have an exhaust fan considering its a bit fancy in Cebu area.

And I had a minor issue upon checking in, reception desk told me I only booked for 1 room on their system but I actually booked for 2 rooms (1 bed); showed them my booking.com account booking that reflected the 2 rooms booked prior. It was resolved but they ended up giving me 2-bed rooms instead of my original booking of 1 bed room. 

Breakfast time‚Äî staff told me I only paid for lesser people (when in my booking, I actually paid for 4 people *2 free breakfast/room*); again I argued and insisted my booking. Was resolved.

 The staff were rude. I booked two double rooms but upon arrival I was told they only had rooms with twin beds, I informed them that I had paid for two double rooms but was told that the rooms were allocated on whom made the earliest booking. I disagreed with this and showed my booking was made for two double rooms and to be fair (albeit there was a suggestion I was lying about my booking even when providing evidence) I was upgraded but had one double room and one twin room. The next problem arose when checking out, I was charged for cleaning of a towel as it (as described by the staff on reception) had a small blood stain on it, I was asked how and why it had happened and as it was my partners sister who was staying in the room I had no clue why there was a blood stain. After asking my partners sister what had happened I was informed she had started her menstruation and hadn't realised. The staff showed no empathy and after staying in many hotels over the years this is the first time I have ever had to pay for anything like this. The staff made my partners sister feel very embarrassed and honestly, although the hotel itself was nice, the staff were horrible.",1.0,2022-10-19T18:39:23+07:00

 Our first time to try the breakfast buffet and we all enjoyed it. Room size was good enough. I did not expect that the 2 small beds, were not really that small. It could actually fit 2 persons. There is an ATM inside & outside the hotel. Although me and my son opted to stay in the hotel instead of our condo, we got the chance to have the view of it and the sea view. Front office staff were very helpful. They said they have upgraded us to a king bed but we did not want it and told them to stick to 2 single beds request and with connecting rooms or at least, with rooms close to each other.
 I got 3 rooms for my family and the room that I was in, if I don't close the toilet bowl cover toilet splashes when flushed. Check out is at 11am. Thankfully, before I left (since I was travelling), I went to front desk and ask for and extension until 1pm since we checked in very late afternoon.

 Location, near to Mactan airport. Valet staff, very helpful with taxi assistance. Room size, good space and amenities are okay as well. Breakfast selection buffet style are good.
 Room smell when we arrive like mold in the room. Requested air purifier but HK only offered room freshener. Lobby atmosphere, not sure if it was just us but we felt that lobby staff (bellboy, front desk) are more lean in to accommodate foreigners vs locals. When we arrive in our backpacking getup from moalboal, we didn‚Äôt feel welcome. No one offered to help with our bags, not match with their luxurious lobby.

 The staff are amazing, very professional and well trained. Random encounters like sharing an elevator they'll greet you and ask about your stay. I am not a king, but felt like one for a few days. Breakfast is luxurious, and Bai cafe counter layout made access to all those delicacies easier with the competitive guests. We booked two rooms for our family, and the on duty manager put us in neighboring room with side-door which was convenient. The rooftop pool is is pretty impressive, not deep enough for diving, but possible to do lane swimming, and great to laze under the cover and enjoy a mighty fine cheeseburger or pizza. Location is nice and close to Park Mall.
 One night, I needed to call operator or reception, and both didn't answer or call back.  (I suppose they were very busy, but a call-back would have been nice). Upon check-in arrival, we were dropped off by a taxi at the lobby xray machine, which was our first experience of the hotel (with an unhelpful guard). Tired from travel, with heavy suitcases and two kids, it would have been great to have a duty porter to assist load the xray machine (if that doesn't breach security protocol). Talking through the perspex reception screen with everyone wearing face masks, leaning down to try to hear reception staff through the holes is a bit of a challenge. (again, a covid protocol).  It will be good when they can dispense with that discomfort. The overall experience, after the initial arrival and check-in, was very positive, however.",9.0,2022-07-28T03:22:18+07:00

 Booked an airport transfer service car and they forgot to pick us up on the scheduled time. Hassle to wait for so long. We booked another transport service and the driver left us after dropping us off in the venue. He was saying another person will pick us up. We had to call the hotel to pick us up. We were the last visitors and the security personnel had to help so we could go back to the hotel safely. Unfortunately we had to wait for hours and it was dark, raining and we were all cold and hungry from waiting for the driver to pick us up. driver was so reckless and there were instances of near miss and accidents that could endangered us passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians.Terrible hotel transport services!",6.0,2022-07-26T07:29:25+07:00

 We just stay here for one Night. The Size of the room was good and the staff was friendly. Also the style and the Interieur  of the hotel is nice.
 We just stay here for one night but experienced some negativ things about the hotel. First of All we arrived in the Buffet Restaurant and they told us that we will get a discount of 30% if were fully vaccinated (that was possible and definitly a positive point) and they told us if we're just 2x vaccinated (we get a discount of 20% - we had one person for that) - if we want to pay they told us the promo is not available anymore, but dont understand why they offer us before.
The Buffet for my opinion is very big and you have a lot of choises, thats why we been very excited. But for me the Quality was just middle - i defintily eat much better in different hotels in the Philippines.
Then unfortunately my little babyboy was sick and vomiting, thats why my wife decided to bring him to the room after the main course - so that we dont make any mess in the Restaurant and dont disturb the other guests. Because she cant really finish her dinner she was asking if I could bring her some little desserts to the room when im done - so I asked the Waitress and she asked the Manager- decision: not possible. I mean i can understand they want us to eat in the Restaurant and not in the room and i could also understand if we want to bring 5 platters with the main course but i just ask for one platter with just a little bit of dessert and i also told them i will bring the platter back after she finish. So i cant really understand their point even if we had a good reason because of my son.
The next morning we went to the Breakfast (buffet) and the lady at the check-in the other day offered us also a promo for the breakfast if im not wrong it was 540php instead of 988php and we said yes we want it please book that one for us. When we arrived at the Restaurant in the morning they told us no there is no promo booked for your room you need to pay the regulare price... after some minutes discussing they allow us to use the promo.",5.0,2022-05-18T10:38:12+07:00

 „Éª The room is sophisticated as shown in the photo.
 „Éª The air conditioner seemed to be out of order (the room temperature was always 18 degrees and the temperature did not rise).  Even after I asked the maintenance staff for repairs for three days, all the staff continued to say, ""This air conditioner is working normally.""  And a few staff treated me as a stranger.  I couldn't sleep because it was too cold for three days, I caught a cold, and after talking with the hotel manager, a detailed mechanic admitted that the air conditioner was out of order.  After that, I was asked to move the room, but it was too late.  I want the hotel to return the staying time.",2.0,2022-03-27T01:25:53+07:00

 Front desk staff verry helpful.
 Very bad system of checking out. Only one member of staff on the front desk at 10:45 (the peak of checking out time is ridiculous) she was doing her best and it was no reflection on her but management needs to fix this. After a wonderful stay with excellent service it took the shine off of our stay, which is a shame and definitely not representative of my stay .
Also the tiles on the bathroom floor were dangerously slippery when wet. An issue the hotel must know about as there was a horrid (but clean) rubber mat in the shower. Unfortunately the rest of the bathroom floor was like an ice rink too.
That said I would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone. I suspect the checking out problem was not the norm as all the staff were exceptional at all other times.",8.0,2022-01-13T23:25:22+07:00
