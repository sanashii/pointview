958750539,"The hotel is old but clean and well-maintained. The food is great and inexpensive, and the pool is clean. The rooms are quiet with thick walls, except for a few partygoers shouting in the hallway. It's recommended for family and business trips.",5,2024-07-09
957299739,"Room was okay, a bit dated, but for the location and price, was all okay. Breakfast was not as good as other days but still fine, since they usually have good breakfast, maybe just that day was mediocre. Check in was smooth at 5pm. Check out was a NIGHTMARE from 11am to 12nn.. Line was stretched all the way near the elevator. I don't know why they only assigned 2 persons our of 4 at the front desk, knowing there was a huge convention, a wedding, and other guests. Check out time is supposed to be busy obviously. Had to call the concierge, sales department and other staff just to let them see how bad it was. And even then it took them 40min before they could fill the 4 out of 4 front desk staff. SO DISAPPOINTED.",2,2024-06-29
956921946,"Room is old.  Only 1 power socket.  Bathroom is very outdated.  Wifi was spotty.

To the positive.  Service was good.  Special requests were filled in a timely manner.  Food was good with many choices.  Lobby was a very nice place to spend time in.  Best feature is it's proximity to the US Consulate.",3,2024-06-27
956278324,"We stayed at the Waterfront hotel in June 24. Very clean rooms , great breakfast buffet,  and lots of choices for lunch and dinner.  We stayed here because the US concalate is located in the same building. The reason for 4 stars is the following,. One king size bed for the 3 of us, wife baby and myself. And there is not a conveant store on site. I had to walk off site the buy, drinks, water, and snacks.",4,2024-06-22
955611986,"Yes Pillows, beddings and towels are bright white and clean which I consider a very important factor in hotel stays.  I also appreciate that room supply of drinking water is not limited.  Housekeeping staff are courteous especially the ladies making up the rooms.  

Breakfast buffet is great, but they never served danggit for our entire  5-day stay.  We expected that.  

The only thing that disappointed us is when my daughter had diarrhea, their clinic charged us PhP20 each for every diatabs tablet.  Emergency medicines like those should be provided free.  And there is no direct line to their clinic.  That is critical for emergency situations/sicknesses.  And calling tru the room telephone line to the operator/reception or housekeeping is so so hard because there’s no dial tone most of the time.  You have to patiently wait for a dial tone. I hope Waterfront address this ASAP.  In emergeny cases, hotel guests are left helpless.",3,2024-06-18
955139977,"I gave this review 3 stars because of the value for the money.. That being said we did have some problems duri ng our 18 night stay..The hotel had no hot water for 4 FULL DAYS..They had a major mechanical issue.....But honestly what upset me more was heading to the pool for a nice cool down at the end of the day,We arrived at the pool at 8:30 p.m. the pool hours are 7am to 9 pm..Only to be told that they were no longer admitting guests..They really didnt give a good reason why...And when I questioned the management they just shruged it off .....THE HOT WATER ISSUE WAS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL..  THE POOL HOURS ARE TOTALLY IN YOUR CONTROL....AND ITS FOR THAT REASON I GAVE YOUR HOTEL 3 STARS...We will be finding a different hotel on our next visit to the Phillipines..",3,2024-06-14
955002588,"Airconditioning can be better. Temp inside the room was not comfortable for me and if you draw the curtains open, it becomes really warm.  They also need to upgrade their shower fixtures.   I loved it that the room was spacious with a king bed for only 3,400 but yeah cool temp is important for me.",3,2024-06-13
954922696,"I wonder how this large property will make it's way back?It's a nice enough place to stay but it has frayed at the edges. No faulting the staff which do their best under the conditions, even the Registration desk which is really understaffed. My most unforgivable item is the poor internet. The impact on this across the whole user population has to have a damaging effect. The hotel offers varied and huge spaces, but they are more representative, I think, of an earlier era that was driven by conventions etc. They are more less diminished from the rise and dominance of the internet... there is something very short-sighted at the upper management/owner level, except that they have a huge amount of property that will probably come to market someday in Cebu... Until then, enjoy your time there, but don't expect to do much online work unless you take up residence in the lobby which seems to have better internet. Pity, I won't be back - there are too many other properties to try in Cebu.",4,2024-06-13
954598125,"Our room had a small rat. We had to call housekeeping at 3 AM to have it removed since it got trapped in the trash bin.

While we did not mind it at all despite the fact that we were with my 2 month old baby with us, what frustrated me was that we did not even receive a single sorry and everyone just pretended that nothinf happened.",1,2024-06-10
952658247,"We were told to go to their downstairs reception for check-in and lined for 2 HOURS with only 2 receptionists, only for the receptionist to tell us that she cannot check us in since we didnt book our room through the 3rd Party. As we decided to book by going directly to the hotel. When we first made our reservation the staff took us back and forth two rooms as he didn't how to deal with the discount offer our school gave us. When he finally sat us down to take the reservation, he kept going back and forth to his superior every question we asked him. Going back to checking in, the receptionist upstairs the line at least took 30-40 minutes. Yet still, the receptionist told us to wait another 30 to 40 minutes as our room was not yet ready. The hotel and staff we're completely unprepared despite knowing that there will at least be a 1000 students having attending grad ball on that day. Many of which, checked in the hotel, having no updated list of who paid and did not. Which led to a singular person taking an hour to check-in. The rooms were outdated, I was not in one of renovated rooms. The air-conditioning was slow despite being set to its highest settings. It has the old rattan furniture. There were barely any outlets and one outlet couldn't even charge a phone. The wifi was also slow or uncooperative.",1,2024-05-27
951847003,"Our family had a great time during our entire stay, so happy because one of our room was upgraded (special shout out to sir Jericho who assissted us in the front desk) that made the kids so happy too, they love the junior suite. Also we're able to enjoy discounted (promo) buffet lunch.",5,2024-05-22
951128496,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks, a grand old lady of a hotel. Room was dated but veey functional, bed comfortable, shower hot and AC kept the room cool. The fridge did like to grind away and clunk on a regular basis. Pool area a nice place to relax, it is in need of some work and a clean around the side of the pool. Should be closed for a few days to bring back the shine to it. Reception area and lounge area a pleasant place to sit and work while watching the world go past. The women who serve and take orders all wonderful and polite, I could not fault any of the hotel team. Now my own big moan and I did give this feedback! Staying for over 20 nights the problem got worse! The problem being lack of sprites available! Jack Daniels ran out after 2 nights! Never seen again, JB one night longer never seen again Jonny Walker Black a few more days! Then the run started to run down to limited options. I have to say this is very poor and I complained so I am only repeating what I said at the hotel. The hotel needs to have a meaningful stock replenishment process. If I had been a normal guest looking for drinks and a meal I would have gone out after the drinks started to run dry and spent my money elsewhere in the evening.a great pity and the only reason I would not give the hotel a 5. Hope to return again in August for a couple of weeks for work again. Let's see if this has improved!",4,2024-05-16
950338603,"We booked at this hotel for our children's school event so we wouldn't have to worry about the traffic and getting good parking space on the day of the event. The price was very affordable and there were a lot of rokm types to choose from.  The room was very spacious, and there was enough space to move around. The beds were very comfy, we had a very good rest. We had a very pleasant stay, in general. The kids enjoyed the pool very much.
Would not think twice to book here again.",5,2024-05-10
948918214,"Our stay was very pleasant and when an emergency occurred which threatened to badly impact my husband’s health, manager Mike Filoteo was there to quickly and efficiently resolve the major problem including all related issues.  Thank you manager Mike.  Thank you Waterfront for having a dependable member as part of your staff.",5,2024-04-30
947509978,"Our stay at the Waterfront Hotel in Cebu was a very pleasant one. All the staff were very friendly and could help with any request we asked them. Their service was outstanding. 
For our hotel room, overall it was good. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on and the room contained everything we needed for our 1 week stay. One disappointment was the shower and toilet as they did not work very well. But I will say that when the toilet at one time was not working they sent a plumber immediately to fix it which was good.
The Waterfront Hotel architecturally is a marvel. We enjoyed going for walks around the outside of the building and inside the building and observing the huge art works on the walls and ceiling. What was also great was the restaurant and cafe options on the Lobby level of the hotel. We particularly liked the food and service at the La Gondola restaurant.
We also appreciated the hotel's pick up service. At our request the Waterfront Hotel organized for a driver to come to meet us when we arrived at Mactan-Cebu airport to drive us straight to the hotel which certainly was a great help for first time visitors to Cebu like us!
We also appreciated their bus shuttle service which took us to the Ayala Mall and back to the hotel. Also there were always taxis available to take us anywhere we wanted to go around Cebu.
Overall, the Waterfront Hotel made our stay in Cebu a comfortable and memorable experience.",4,2024-04-19
939588757,"The hotel is ok but could really do with some improvements. It is an old hotel and the rooms are generally worn. The window was very dirty and one of the lights was in poor condition. There was also no bidet or brush for the toilet. 

 For the 14 nights I stayed, there was no soap in the male swimming pool toilets. The toilets were also in a generally poor condition, and it felt like they were just neglected.

I found the staff generally good. The cleaning staff was excellent. Security were polite and numerous. It felt very safe. Breakfast was excellent. As you are not allowed to use the stairs, it can be ridiculous trying to get back to your room when there are big events going on. I had to wait over 45 mins one evening just to return to my room. 

Overall, I would not say this was a terrible hotel, though I do believe it is overpriced relative to other chealer hotels I stayed in the area. I can believe it used to be once great, but it feels like it has been left behind to rot. With investment and a heavy focus on modernization, this hotel has the potential to be great.",3,2024-02-24
938828024,"Cebu waterfront hotel is a large and elegant hotel in Cebu city (not near the waterfront).  I stayed in an ambassador suite.  It was large and comfortable with a nice living area with a half bath, and a separate bedroom with a full bath.   Everything worked well in the room.  
You are greeted by staff outside the hotel, and the lobby doors are opened for you and you are greeted again by young women in long red dresses in the lobby. 
There are restaurants, conference rooms, a gym and a large pool and garden area.  The pool area looked to be showing its age but it was still attractive. 
Staff were courteous and helpful.  My only problem or complaint is that there were a number of conventions or conferences going on so it was very busy.  The line for the free breakfast was long and there was only one person checking people in for breakfast and it was taking a minute or two for each guest. They needed to get more help at that point. We had to skip breakfast and that was a little annoying.",4,2024-02-18
937903704,"After coming across a positive review from a vlogger, I opted to book a stay at this hotel for the conference I'm attending.

937453647,"Nice hotel near the airport in Cebu City. Having a casino in the same building surely makes some people staying here, but probably most customers are here for one night after or before a flight.

937390565,I tried booking at the lapu lapu hotel waterfront and casino by the airport.. I was on the website for this site and it redirected me to cebu city. I ended up making the reservation and wasn't able to switch to the one by the airport. I had to pay for the reservation without using the room. I did stay and the lapu lapu waterfront and casino so i could be at the airport early . It was a very nice hotel. But didn't like how I couldn't switch the reservation.,3,2024-02-07
935176097,"I booked my flight through online. I was hesitant at the beginning because of the price, and my husband insisted me that I have to stay in this hotel for safety, or secure stay, and the bonus part was the food buffet, all the staff were friendly and also the cleaning time of the room, she was super quick to clean my room. Overall, it was a great experienced, spacious room, I was at the 8th floor. I had a leaking experienced but the engineering staff went and fixed it fast.  I stayed for less than a week, 5 days maximum, Thank you for my safe and pleasant experienced, Hopefully I could go back and bring my entire family to stay next time!",5,2024-01-24

934172558,"Excellent architecture and location. Has a casino for gambling enthusiasts. Taxis are not a problem, and it has its own shuttle service to and from the nearby Ayala Mall. But it's getting antiquated, by still using soaps, instead of liquid gels. Toilet does not have bidet. A little upgrade and this hotel would be great again.",4,2024-01-15
934161519,"This was our second staycation experience with Waterfront Hotel & Casino-Lahug. Our first overnight stay here was in March 2021 and everything was good back then. However, when we came back last weekend, the experience was no longer memorable. The phone was not working, I requested for a flat iron but the staff claimed that it was not available, the carpet was not vacuumed as it was dusty, and the window glass got stains all over that I could not appreciate the view. Our reservation included breakfast also but we did not enjoy the food (pancit was dry, bacon was overcooked to name a few) - even my partner who is a chef, commented on how unpleasant the food was.

Personally, I paid for an overnight stay in a 4-star hotel but it seemed the experience was that for a 2- or 3-star.",2,2024-01-15
930662161,"It was a great stay and i love the foods of their breakfast/dinner buffet. The hotel's staffs are also accommodating. Me, my brother and mom are also satisfied w/ the service and our room also has a great view on the outside.",5,2023-12-23
929387588,"Grand hotel, despite its age. Excellent staff, good facilities and fine dining.
Comfortable room, but two single beds pushed together, do NOT make a King bed. Wifi is too weak in the room to be able to work using the internet.
TV reception is good, safebox and refrigerator. Plenty of warm water. Quiet rooms, plenty of exercise equipment in the gym.",4,2023-12-13
928088692,"My daughter, who is based in the United States, booked a hotel room for us. I provided her with my credit card details as I did not have a computer to book the room. When she attempted to complete the payment, the site notified her that ""Payment was not authorized"". Those EXACT words. There was no confirmation number. She subsequently tried again assuming that it could be an error. And again it stated that payment was not authorized. Because of the urgent need for a room, she ended up using her own credit card to book a room for us and this transaction went through. 

Upon arriving to the hotel, we were mortified to find out that we were charged 3 TIMES!! How completely misleading and fraudulent. After explaining the situation to the front desk, we ended up booking a second night and using two of the 3 charges for 2 nights. But we EXPLICITLY said that the third charge must be refunded. We only received ONE CONFIRMATION page, and we even gave in by booking a second night so we didn't have to argue about getting two refunds. We were told that my daughter needed to submit an email request (they provided a specific email), and then the refund could be issued. That email was sent on November 17, and to date, WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE. 

Waterfront Management, you should be ashamed. First, you allowed for this malfunction to create duplicate charges on your website. If a page says payment NOT authorized, customers will obviously assume a payment didn't go through. You should have immediately corrected this issue upon arrival. And not only did you not correct his, you completely IGNORED a customer email that required your action. 

My family has done multiple stays throughout the years to Waterfront, despite how completely outdated it has become. But we draw the line at dishonesty and fraudulent practices.",1,2023-12-01
927589210,"I'm SO ANGRY!! I'M currently in a room with NO WIFI, and I need it to work & call home! I've stayed in hostels with better wifi than this! 

It just says connected, then disconnects straight away. We've tried this on 2 phones and a laptop. It's clearly an issue and having read the reviews, some from over a year ago, it clearly isn't ever going to change. Wish I'd looked sooner as I never would have booked! 

SO, if you're coming here and planning to be connected, just don't expect to be! 

Luckily I have an ESim, but it's not strong enough to do what I need to so I have to go to the lobby and sit there to do a personal call. Absolute joke when you pay this sort of money! ",1,2023-11-27
927179848,"Ambassador room was great; except no hot water and minimal water pressure. Bkfst, filling but nothing exciting.
Casino was borderline horrid with broken machines outnumbering working ones, half the working ones played by ghosts who stuck cards in them and played minimum bet, no  beverages offered, needs cleaning and updated machines.
Great location and attentive staff.",3,2023-11-24
923390283,"I liked that everyone was very friendly and accommodating. I liked the lobby lounge/cafe, the pool, and the sights in the hotel. 

I didn't like that there was no bidet and the pillows were not good quality. I also think the room carpets are not thoroughly cleaned. ",4,2023-10-28
921820158,"I have been regular visitor to this hotel for nearly 7 years now (refer to previous reviews) and have seen the hotel go through lots of change. What has remained the same is the friendly, welcoming and professional staff. The housekeeping staff are all such friendly people and it doesn't matter where you go, you are always welcomed with a big beautiful smile. 

I have provided this travelling tip before - book the ambassador rooms which gives you access to the ambassador lounge for the full VIP privileges - it actually doesn't cost that much extra! 4

Located on the top floor with panoramic views back over the city to Mactan Island this is the perfect way to relax and unwind - and as a bonus they provide free happy hour from 5pm - 7pm inclusive of free drinks (yes including alcohol) and snacks. Having been a frequent visitor to this lounge I have had the privilege of being looked after by past butlers Wilden, Mike and Aubrey, who all of whom no longer work in the lounge due to well deserved promotions and still connected to the hotel.

The new butlers Joseph , Chel and Arnold are just as equally professional, friendly, well mannered and very accommodating. I cannot wait to check in tomorrow and see the team again. Truly a great team who cannot do enough for you.

The conference team and facilities are first class with all types of rooms for small groups up to the grand ball room 5,000 people. All needs are catered for and I have attended some amazing events which take your breath away. A special thank to Miss Sophia who arranges my teams conference with such short notice and professionalism.

Finally, the hotel itself has a vast array of restaurants to choose from including buffet (Uno), Italian (la gongola my favourite), Chinese (Tin Gow) and Japanese (Mizu). The pool area is amazing with a large pool and decorative waterfall. The gym and sauna are also world class. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Cebu City and across the road from the IT park and 5 min walk to Ayala Mall. 

Its a great hotel in a great location with amazing, friendly and professional staff - trust me you cannot go wring booking here.",5,2023-10-18
919556020,"We stayed in the hotel as part of Cebu Dancesport competition held from 29 to 30 September.  We decided to head to the gym where there was a private enclosed area for some warm up.  The gym manager demanded that we pay an entry fee, despite being told earlier that it’s free for hotel guests! Not that it’s a big amount, but the gym manager insisted on charging after she learnt that we are part of the team of competitors.  She even turned the table around and said that we were dishonest! What’s so dishonest about being hotel guests? And does being a competitor meant being discriminated against ?
It reeked  of dishonesty and opportunistic on the part of the gym manager.
The stay and incident left an extremely bad taste in our visit Cebu City.  

Never to return.",1,2023-10-03
917831727,"Very poor poor service especially upon checkin. Our family was booked through hotel vouchers we got. But upon checkin, my sister didn’t have the physical vouchers since she came straight from the airport. So instead she presented a photo. But unfortunately, they just wouldn’t consider and insisted for the vouchers to be brought to the hotel. 
This is despite my sister’s name was registered and the room was booked under her name. At the same time, they also charged a security deposit which by the way they didnt hand the receipt.
So so disappointing.  Never coming back, never recommending this hotel!
Also, hotel is old. Amenities are not working like the sauna.",1,2023-09-22

906163395,"It used to be good but since Covid it has gone downhill. The rooms are getting tired, the lobby needs work, the staff need better training and it needs new management and an investment. Last time I stayed I had a cold shower for 5 days straight even though every day I was told it had been fixed. Management is obviously very poor and this shows. I have stayed there 12 times but never again.",3,2023-07-28
905784371,"While this remains as one of the well-known hotels in Cebu City, particularly in Lahug area, it is clearly old and needs renovation. The ground floor is okay, with very few but nice shops and restaurants, but the upper floors, especially the rooms, show clear signs of deterioration. The carpets were stained, some furniture's upholstery was also old, the headboard of my bed had some torn canvass, some parts of the lampshade were peeling off, etc. WIFI was also weak, and the conference rooms were not soundproof. We had a three-day function in one of the conference rooms on the second floor and we could hear all the noises coming from the other conference rooms. The swimming pool and the gym were small. The elevators were very slow. Lastly, the menu of the restaurant near the lobby had a very limited selection of food and drinks. I hope they would really renovate the whole place. On the positive side, the hotel personnel were all kind and helpful. 😀 ",3,2023-07-26

898267383,"We stayed here for the for the first time four years ago and I loved it. This time we used it as a base in cebu  for a 4 week tour. It fell short unfortunately. It is looking a little tired  now, the pool area has a derelict waterfall that is taped off, the rooms are hit and miss in quality too. One night we stayed in 1411  and it wasn't until we were on our way to Danao port my wife said I was bitten all night by something, were you?. Er, no!!. And if I was I wouldn't have stayed in the bed. I'm not saying there were bed bugs in our bed but only when she sprayed her legs in 50% deet did it stop. Final day we stayed we didn't get a room until 16.15 having arrived from the camotes island at 13.00. Shame as I really liked this place. The only people getting booked in were ones for the engineering  weekend!!. I also paid for a late checkout to find the room above had a team in knocking the room apart. Thanks for that!!!

893461129,"Not impressed with this hotel. Would not return.
I did a last minute, literally booked this the day before, trip to Cebu. Not much hotel availability anymore at that time so I picked this one. I figured a 4 star rated hotel with a casino and nice pics should be nice. I was not a fan of this hotel, and I don’t need much fancy at all.
Upon arrival, the lobby is huge and looks nice, but it was smelly. It was very clean but the smell didn’t want me stay in the area at all. 
The room was just ok. The bed wasn’t very comfortable, but ok. 
The bathroom appliances were old and my shower pull bottom from switching from bath tub mode to shower mode was stuck so I only got have the water shower. I didn’t bother asking for new room or getting this fixed. I made due. 
Casino was boring. Lots of slots machines, some card tables, but nothing exciting going on there, so just spent an hour, blew some pesos on roulette and slots and called it a night. Had more hope for that.
Pool is basic, but on ground floor surrounded by walls so no fresh breeze can get there. Not impressed.
Gym was ok. Nothing special.

Overall, not recommended. Also I don’t know why this is called waterfront. There is absolutely no water nearby.",3,2023-06-04
892025977,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in May 2023. It was a good stay. Rooms are reasonable in size for a four star hotel. Buffet breakfast was OK , the choices average. Staff were polite and helpful. Centrally located. I would be happy to recommend this hoel. ",4,2023-05-26
891555088,"Stayed in for 1 night. They don’t live up to their brand. 
- Checkin experience was average. They had only 3 desks open for checkin. Resulting in people standing in queue for more than 15mins. 
- Pool area definitely needs maintenance. Broken chairs, chipped tiles, slippery areas. 
- Bar at the pool - Don’t come with any expectations. Only selective beer available. No cocktails or wine by the pool. 
- Drinks inside the hotel - strictly ok. Again very few options. 
- Restaurants- they have several restaurants serving different cuisines like Italian, Japanese, Chinese etc. Being a vegetarian (no meat no fish) we wanted buffet option. There was nothing that we could use except bread. So we ended up eating Italian. Quality not upto mark with price and hotel name. Breakfast buffet was strictly okay. First time, I saw scrambled eggs (half done) was already part of breakfast spread. 
- Room - absolutely average again. Tiniest bathroom. Strong smell in the room. 
- Weirdest instruction/suggestion that I saw for the 1st time in a huge and branded hotel - Double lock your door from inside. Means use the latch too. 

Definitely not staying ever here!",2,2023-05-23
891367018,"The shower was third world, dated and dirty room. I booked the wrong waterfront hotel.

890791520,"My cousin booked me a room here which strategically the location is perfect since it’s just in middle of the city. Accessible from shopping area and nearby restaurants.

My body can usually tell either the place is clean or dusty/moldy as I have eczema. I arrived late night at the hotel. As I entered the room it really felt dusty and my allergies flared up after few hours inside. I didn’t bother to call the front desk to complain since it was very late and I was really tired and sleepy. It was a nightmare experience. When sleeping I was scratching and felt there was something biting me and still my body was too tired and can’t open my eyes so I didn’t bother. Fast forward, when I took a shower I noticed I have some marks on my skin and for the first time in my life that I was bitten by a bed bugs!

When I checked out that day I told the receptionist about the experience but you know what she just said she asked me if I did report it. And told her “Yes, I’m reporting it now to you” and she replied “You should immediately reported it” at the back of my mind I was like “yes I am staying here just for a night. I didn’t see the reason of reporting it immediately when I am about to checked out the following day, that is why I am saying it to you right now lady”. That lady didn’t even bother to apologize and made me feel like it was my fault that I didn’t report it. Like what!??

Anyway, you have a beautiful and huge lobby.",1,2023-05-17

We also tried the casino, not so much luck but a good experience.
During the day we also enjoyed the nice pool area and we also took the free transfer to Ayala mall with so many different stores

879355012,"Soo disappointing !! Me and my partner has a high expectation to stay at the waterfront hotel and casino cebu city but unfortunately not. Since my boyfriend is an Arab I’m the one to choose the right hotel here in Cebu just to show the hospitality of the Filipino . It was a long decision to make and choose a welllknown hotel in Cebu  it’s because we had been so many famous hotel around the world . since we are living in the middle East just to feel the differences we tend to find a unique hotel during our vacation . Me and my arab boyfriend was upset by the time we enter the main entrance of the hotel.  There is one security guard name Gonzales who went us and talk very rudely. Instead of welcoming us and explain about  the rules here. Because we are using a big motorbike here in Cebu but it’s very shame the way he talked to us is not acceptable as a guest . Me and my boyfriend felt uncomfortable that time. And was shocked ! We are not homeless he should not talk like that and he’s behavior is funny. He don’t even talk to us nicely and calmly. And there’s one more funny thing about that security, we asked him to give a few minutes to enter the reception for our reservation before we park our motorbike because we are in a rush time . So after that we were at the reception talking to the 2 ladies . And I don’t understand they are struggle to attain the guest  one lady talking the phone and the other one making herself busy instead of assisting us first and explain about the rooms and the procedure we deny feel they welcoming us . No smile at all even they are wearing a mask we can see if they are smiling or not . So we spend an hour to request our reservation that time. And so ridiculous that security came to us while we are sitting in the lobby with my boyfriend. Because we discuss about our plans for that day. And the security suddenly came to us and keep telling us that we need to park the motorbike . Very annoying !! Common . The management of the hotel pls take action for this ! I don’t want to feel that to any of ur guest !  We don’t even complain the room that they gave  us. Very old and not so clean as what we expect . We found a dusty ..until we checkout that hotel one more security is very annoying ! We asked him to find a taxi for us because we are so late for our flight . But he told to us to wait. But he’s gesture was so bad . They are not doin their job . They act like they are the boss haha lol 😂   .. and the funny is I can understand their dialect . They don’t talk to my boyfriend I don’t know why they struggle to explain to him in English . They let me explain ito my boyfriend. For what?  Talked to him !!! Anyhow  We just enjoy the breakfast buffet . The service staff and the manager was so nice at the restaurant  They treat us vip and we appreciate.  We will never come back for sure ! The pool is very poor . The ambience very poor .",1,2023-02-19

I complained about it and asked the front desk where I could possibly get good connections , they just responded that they couldn’t do anything since they’re fully booked!

866221915,"I have been a regular guest at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City & Casino for the every year for the past 15 years except 2020-2021 due to covid.
Frankly, I see a decline in service and facilities and there is little or no action to address this.
At breakfast I requested more milk for cereal as the milk carafe was empty. To my surprise the waiter returned with a 2-litre carton of unchilled milk. After explaining to him that cereals are always served with chilled milk he returned with chilled milk. But next day same thing. The milk in the carafe was not chilled and the container it was in had no ice to keep it chilled. Once again, I asked for chilled milk and it was replaced. I later saw a manager pointing out that chilled milk is standard provision for cereals and all hotels follow that just as Waterfront has always done in my previous stays there, including my stay at Waterfront Cebu City in May this year.
The manager totally agreed. Next day on entering the restaurant for breakfast a waiter approached me and said you want chilled milk sir? No I said, not just me, everyone expects chilled milk for cereals. I pointed out juices are provided there chilled in dispensers.  Milk should also be provided chilled for cereals and simply just for drinking a glass of milk.
Two days later it happened again - unchilled milk. After leaving the restaurant, I asked to speak to manager, a different one this time. This manager also agreed and same thing again followed next day. A waiter asked if I want chilled milk.  
The two managers were simply identifying the issue as a special request by a particular guest. No.  It is not a special request. Providing chilled milk is a standard requirement for all guests and up till now Waterfront has always automatically done that without being asked during my many stays there, as it should.
Suggestion: Get a cold liquid dispenser for milk just like the 4 chilled juice dispensers that are there in the breakfast restaurant.
When we went down to lower lobby we immediately noticed a bad odour in the corridors like the smell from a rubbish tip. It became clear, that this was not just our imagination, when I saw a small air purifier turned on at a power point in the corridor. But clearly this little purifier was not enough to dispel this odour which was also  outside in the garden and pool area which is critically in need of redevelopment.  Alarmingly, there are no proper change/shower/toilet facilities in the pool area and this was the case well before covid 19. The previous male facility for the pool which had showers, lockers and toilets has been closed for many years. I was told the nearest male facility was in the gym back inside the hotel, quite a distance from the pool. Totally unsatisfactory. You don’t want to walk inside the hotel wet after using pool. And what are they doing about it? Nothing. Still in the too-hard basket.
The previously provided shade umbrellas have gone. Not one umbrella there. Ground drainage channels need upgrade- algae should not be visible. The rock looks like it has passed its use-by date. Pull at down and redevelop the area providing proper change room facilities.
I reported the odour issue in the lower lobby to a manager. The manager agreed there was a bad odour there but days later no change, odour still there with the one small air purifier working.
I get the feeling, Waterfront has been aware of this odour problem for some time but has taken no proper action to address the issue. I might add this odour problem was not there when we stayed in the hotel earlier this year in May.
What needs to be done? Provide more air purifiers? No. No. No. Track down the source of the smell and contain or remove it.
Waterfront managers just agreeing with guests of an existing issue is not enough. Action to fix it is what is required.",2,2022-10-27

844965707,"I've been staying at the Waterfront Hotel every few years since 2008. It used to be the go to luxury hotel in Cebu City, and I loved everything that the hotel had to offer.
However the hotel has as of recently dropped below its 5 star standards. Customer service is second to none as always, and it's a reason that I still remain a loyal customer.
Some points to consider;
▪️The room bathrooms now show visible mould
▪️Basin tap was leaking
▪️Carpets are very worn out
▪️Rooms appear very dusty in hard to reach areas
▪️Room walls have discoloured.

The lobby is a great part of the hotel, I would bring guests here to drink almost every night, an excellent part of the hotel offering.
The breakfast buffet was brilliant as always with a huge selection of international and local dishes.

In conclusion, the hotel does seem to have aged considerably, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but may put into question its 5 star status.",4,2022-06-27

The staff and the service crew on the day of our event were also very polite and attentive to our concerns and instructions. The food for our snacks at the venue were also good according to our guests. If you have time, please also try their buffet lunch or dinner at Cafe Uno near the main lobby. You’d be amazed by the visual presentation and the mouth-watering flavors of their dishes. We’ll definitely come back at the Waterfront Hotel for more events. It’s a 10/10 experience.

Let’s just say the toilet looked like a public toilet, the ones you see in ratchet clubs at 4 in the morning, if you know what I mean. The food at the reception was horrid!!!! The food looked like it was food for the pigs!! The servers were the ones plating the food, the plates were so full of food that the sauces were mixing, the salad was mixed with the chicken and rice, the lumpia tasted like kaldereta.

Same goes with the drinks. no second drink allowed. one of my friends did not ask for his plate as we shared. the mother of the groom ask for her food and been told that if she want we need to pay additional for another person as all the plates has been serve.

After all taking a family of 3 adults and child to a nice place,  can run as much, if not more, after ordering main, sides, dessert, ice tea and cofffee etc etc .. adds up..

The hotel had zero hot water in the whole building and other guests said it had been like this for days.  Any hotel can have issues, but this going on so long gives an insight to how bad it is.
