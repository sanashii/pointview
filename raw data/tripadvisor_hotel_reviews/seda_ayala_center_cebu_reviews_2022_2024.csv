956619463,"The Seda Cebu staff are exceptional. From the doormen who are attentive even noting my mother's shawl and asking if it was too cold to the Lounge staff who are quick and helpful. 
But the ultimate service was provided by the Misto team under the watch of Jegger who noted my harassed demeanor so took extra care of me while I was working on some writing that lasted from breakfast to 4 pm. 
Angelica was extra sweet and attentive. Jegger assured me I had the space to work out whatever needed to be done. 
Everyone else had a nod or a smile from time to time. 
They really went over and beyond in making me feel good, fed and comfortable.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. 
Special thanks as well to Stephen and the other Reception staff who indulged my requests for stationery to write on. 
Kudos as well to the GM for such team spirit. 
Will really spread the word. 
I stayed for 6 days.",5,2024-06-25
955074469,"Ok i thought i would write a second review on this hotel, my second visit.
One my first visit i was not happy and i will not go into that here you can scroll back to see that.

What i will say is this hotel in my eyes greatly improved - front of house was much better this time taking the time to make sure i was looked after and had everything i needed.
Extended me the curtsey of a late check out as my flight was a late departure and were very friendly in all interactions.

I stayed in the club lounge again and it was great and well worth the extra

The selling point of this hotel is the location 2 mins and you are in the Ayala mall where all your needs can be catered for.

The pool area is a little small but adequate and the food here was great

I cant fault this hotel and will always stay here if i need a central location IE Not Mactan Island

Well Done Seda

See you soon

PS - Bring back the chocolate fruits i really missed them, or open a shop and sell them i would buy lots :)",5,2024-06-14

954574409,"I've been staying at Seda Properties especially at Seda Ayala Center since 2011.  I cannot say enough how much I appreciate the Staff Team Members. They go above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and safe. I've stayed in three of their properties. Seda Ayala Center, Seda IT Bloc, and Seda Lio, Palawan and ALL Staff Team Members were wonderful. However, regarding the properties, Seda Ayala Center desperately needs a renovation. The decor has not been changed since Marriott owned it in 2011 and you can see the dated decors. The Seda IT Bloc, it's new and nice. The decor is up to date and it does not have that musty smell like Seda Ayala. Seda Lio, it's has lovely grounds but the rooms may need to be updated. Overall, I recommend in staying with Seda properties because of their outstanding Staff Team Members. ",5,2024-06-10
954502184,"Even though it is just an overnight stay, we were very happy and in awe with the quality of service that we received.

950388532,"It is convenient to stay near the Ayala mall without having to cross streets, esp. that it is quite hot in the city in May.
Breakfast was sufficient, although the small breakfast area was packed with a large number of guests despite a fast turnover. Poor staff quite stressed out...
Standard room of good size with qualitative pillows and sheets. Bathroom likewise but has a stinky smell coming out of the toilet corner. A pity for the price you pay.
Shower a bit slippery but hot water works. Aircon is also easy to set up. TV less so with a bit of some getting acquainted with the system as it was set to a channel that is not available.
All in all, convenience tops the negative points. Might still stay here depending on the price and whether there is a conference being held there. Might  be better to take a suite.",4,2024-05-11

932400327,Not worth the price. The price does not match the service and quality.  Moldy ceiling in bathroom with rusted trash can. Water stains everywhere.  Service at the restaurant was sub par with very rude and uncaring staff.  Could barely get a coffee with breakfast and no creamer offered or provided.  No one available to seat us but then rude when we tried to seat ourselves. Sub par selections at breakfast (not even bacon?).  All the bread was either stale or overcooked.  Save your money and go to Quest. Same quality at half the price. ,2,2024-01-05

932331244,"To be a 5 star hotel, I would say the hotel must have the SENCE of environment, impeccable SERVICE and Perfect AMENITIES.
But due to the existing building constrain it might be little bit hard to achieve all that... but still there are many things that can be changed, especially the SERVICE.
Please try to ask your top executive to stay for at least 4~7days and find what is missing in the service... long wait in the operator... not enough staffs to handle the demands... slow room service... and top of all I cannot see or feel any SELLING POINT of the Hotel...
So, the price is in the 4 star hotel range but service is 2 to 3 star....

928037822,"A very popular hotel in Cebu with a good location next to a shopping mall. 
An hour's taxi ride from the airport.

Check-in and reception worked smoothly. The bags came to the room later and the size of the room was just fine. 

The air conditioning was really efficient, even so that it could be turned off all night so that the temperature became suitable. The heating didn't really seem to work. The room is equipped with an empty refrigerator and views of the roof and the adjacent construction site. So not very attractive in that sector. 
The bed deserves a golden brick award because it was super hard and very uncomfortable. Every movement of the person sleeping next to me felt like sailing, but the pillows were perfectly fine. 
Things worked in the bathroom and the shower was efficient and hot water came out. 

The lobby of the hotel was very comfortable and spacious, you could get drinks at a reasonable price from the bar and the pool area was very clean and the sunbeds were spacious. 
From the hotel, it is easy to visit the shopping center next door, where there were really comprehensive shops and dining options. 

One of the best parts of the hotel was definitely the best breakfast in Cebu. It was really wide and sank into the European bloated stomach really smoothly. The food was good and really varied.",4,2023-12-01

926540648,"After a long day travelling I checked into this hotel specifically requesting a QUIET room (now I realise Filipino's don't do quiet but hey worth asking right?)
They allocated me the exact opposite overlooking the Hotel delivery bay. I rolled with this as sometimes you have to in life but what followed was unforgivable and an egregious fundamental error in hotel management. Jetlagged I was woken up at 12.30 in the morning by the hotel staff cleaning the room next door. I complained the following morning and asked to speak with the Hotel manager who was not available but was told she would be informed and contact me. Nothing.
Miss Dela Cruz apparently has 35 years of hotel management experience behind her and yet does not have the common decency or common courtesy to personally apologise. Madam you are not fit to work in hospitality. I will be taking this up with my credit card company as there has been a breach of contract in terms of what is reasonable to expect from a hotel of your stature.

925921131,"Former Marriott which we have stayed many times before.

Easy access to Ayala Mall thru the back entrance. Amenities included free refillable bottled water, toiletry kits, electronic safe, refrigerator, kettle, coffee and tea. Room was clean and adequate with 2 queen size beds. There was desk and sofa in the room. 

Buffet was ok. We stayed 2 nights. The food choices varied every day. There is an omelet station and noodle station. The hot meals are catered mainly to the Filipino palette which is ok for us. There are cold cuts, a small salad and 3 varieties of fruits limited to pineapple, watermelons and cantaloupes. Surprised not to see mangoes?

Landers is within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.
There is an ongoing road construction currently across the hotel.

Taxi to SM city about php 180. 

The hotel is showing its age. I take one stars off for the towels. Not as bright white as it used to be. Time to be replaced. 

Another star off for a missing perfume from my unlocked carry on bag. (It was a cheap perfume with 1/4 left. Surprisingly, the more expensive sealed perfume in the bag was not taken) First time I lost something in a hotel room from all my local and worldwide travels. It‚Äôs really sad especially this happened in my home country! The moral of the story is - always lock your bags and don‚Äôt leave any valuables lying around!

I haven‚Äôt heard back from Seda management on the results of their investigation and if anything unusual was seen from their security cameras. I requested them to recheck their security cameras if there was somebody else who entered the room. No update as of this writing.

Security is adequate. Need the room access card to take elevator to your room. Staff were friendly and hospitable.",3,2023-11-14

920422269,"We went for a quick weekend getaway to Cebu last October 6-8, 2023 as a treat of a friend. My Mom and I were booked in a Junior Suite and stayed in room 907. We had the privilege to enjoy their Club Lounge during our stay. 

Comparing my last stay in this hotel way back in 2019, it felt like the hotel has been refreshed. It felt more ""maaliwalas"" and the entire hotel smelled really nice. The lobby, hallway, room, gym, and other facilities are well-maintained. 

However, what makes this hotel stand-out for me is it's SERVICE and its food. 

The breakfast spread at Misto was really something to look forward to. I will always look forward to their hot chocolate (the best I've tasted ever), omelettes, garlic rice, and the dried pusit. All the rest are so good too. The spread at the Club Lounge during Evening Cocktails wasn't too wide, but it is more than enough to fill and satisfy.

Last but definitely not the list, I shall take this time to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to those staff who gave outstanding service.

Erlyn at the Front Desk, though she wasn't the one who checked me in, greeted me with a warm smile and welcomed me back as I was still approaching the desk. It is heartwarming that she still remembered me. She was also very kind when she checked us out.

Paulo, the Bellman who assisted us with our luggage when we arrived, was very helpful and kind. He gave good recos when I asked about nearby establishments. 

The Misto team, particularly Samantha, Sofia, Kenneth, Gade (Kitchen), and Castillano (Security) were all so remarkable. They are an asset. 

Marry of the Club Lounge also left a mark as she delivered impeccable service. She's always smiling and was extremely courteous and charming. 

Our short but meaningful stay in Cebu was made possible by the team. Ms. Gwen, you are doing such a great job with your team and Seda ACC family. Thank you for letting us enjoy our stay. Kudos to you all! ",5,2023-10-08
920255550,"The day we arrived in this hotel, the F.O Supervisor (ERLYN) had been our lifesaver for our entire stay. She gone out of her way to get us a discount when we wanted to upgrade and work out a special deal for us. We stayed from the 1st Oct - 9 Oct. 
She is professional and again, gone out of her way to communicate to the reservation desk in the other hotel that we are going to stay and ask if we could pay the bill upon arrival. 
All in all, me and partner would like to thank Erlyn that she made our stay very very enjoyable and wonderful experience!!!!

thank you again, Seda cebu. xx",5,2023-10-07

We were a bit hesitant because usually it's a hotel service it would be nice to be informed that's all. Everything was okay the driver was polite and  very informative that made the travel short. The hotel is beautiful and we loved the breakfast plus near Ayala mall .

It's a good place to stay.  Thank you",4,2023-10-05
919856441,"I stayed for two nights in a room that offered views of Ayala Terraces and the pool area. The hotel lobby features a waiting area where guests can use a complimentary desktop PC for making future bookings. However, our experience was marred by an unpleasant and musty odor emanating from the carpets throughout the entire property. I strongly suggest that they consider either replacing or removing these carpets to enhance the overall quality of the facilities. Despite the age of the building, there is definitely room for improvement.

The hotel's location, adjacent to Ayala Terraces, proves to be convenient for accessing Ayala Mall. Additionally, there is a small pool with a bar; however, the music from the pool bar can be quite disruptive for those who are seeking rest after a long and exhausting flight. It would be advisable for them to take measures to reduce the noise levels.",3,2023-10-05
918909679,Food was amazing. Service is superb. Managers are approachable. Friendly staff. Convenient because it is near the mall. Not very expensive as I expected. The range of what you pay is worth the service. Highly recommended...............,5,2023-09-28

916455990,"This was going to be a 4 star review but it‚Äôs the little things that let it down unfortunately.
We had a club room which was fairly average and quite small but clean and functional. Cleaning staff were brilliant and very friendly even leaving nice messages for us.
The club lounge once again is fairly average with a decent breakfast but the shining point was the staff who were super helpful.
At point of booking I asked for a late checkout, now I am a travel agent and know is not guaranteed however I did ask the night before and they said 1 to 130 should be ok but I should check in that morning.
I called 0 twice and lady said she would call me back in 2 mins, she never did!
Finally I went to reception and met a rude member of staff who point blankly told me no!

As a uk travel agent I will not be returning to this hotel nor will I recommend it to my clients or indeed the other 200 members of staff who I work  with Seda

That‚Äôs a fail",2,2023-09-13
916293745,"Honestly quite disappointed with my 2 nights stay at Seda Ayala. Understand the hotel was a bit old but the sound prove is really bad! I could hear everything on the hall way from my room! Ppl talking, walking, closing doors etc. Also there are weird noise from the pipes from earlier morning. My colleague next door also experienced the same. If you are a light sleeper you need to choose another hotel. 

Breakfast was pretty average as well and they are so busy one morning I need to wait at the lobby area for 10mins for a table. 

I wouldn‚Äôt come back to this hotel for my next visit to Cebu ",2,2023-09-12

Prior email arrangements with Misto Assistant Manager Adonis for lunch and dinner assured my group of a lovely and pleasurable dining experience. Angelica made sure we enjoyed our pasta and pizza buffet lunch which was quite interesting. We also got excellent menu recommendations from Camille who assisted my group of ten at dinner and everyone loved the a la carte dishes as well as her efficiency kind attention to detail.

Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn‚Äôt turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I was doing while there and making sure I was happy.  Thank you Mary. Lastly I wanted to call out the wonderful breakfast buffet with foods from many culture as well as a very nice and attentive staff.

911893349,"Stayed here twice on separate occasions during our recent holiday in Cebu. Staff were very friendly throughout the duration of both our stays. Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn‚Äôt get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.
We stayed in room 915 which had a nice view of the city/mall and room 703 with an ok view. Overall we enjoyed our stay and will probably stay again on our next visit.",4,2023-08-21

911574603,"First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!¬† Smiles and greetings everyday!

We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).

We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.¬† (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the other side since we booked through Agoda.

The room was nicely decorated and the bed comfortable - the pillows were so-so.¬† Linens and towels were nice.¬† The TV channel list was not correct - and missing quite a few channels (I noticed this last year, but no updates were done to the list).¬† I scrolled through all channels, updated the list and provided it to Reception.¬† There was a sewer smell around the toilet in the bathroom - probably a wax seal gone bad over the years - to which we reported during our stay, but declined the offer of maintenance replacing (or moving rooms) as it wasn't too bad - but I confirmed with Reception when we checked out to have maintenance resolve before they put any other guests in the room.

The fridge (what they refer to as a ""chiller"") was warm - even on the coldest setting.¬† I reported it to Reception - they sent up maintenance to check.¬† They tried to tell me that it's only a ""bar fridge chiller"" - but there was no ""mini-bar"" offerings in it  - and since it was not operating correctly (chilling anything less than the room temperature) they replaced it with a proper small fridge since we'd be staying for two weeks and wanted to store drinks and snacks during our stay.¬† Additionally, maintenance also replaced the A/C filter in the room at my request since it looked like it needed changing.

Housekeeping staff (Grace and Mike) were great!¬† We didn't need daily service, but we did get towel replacements and fresh water every day.

We dined daily in the Misto Restaurant for the buffet breakfast.¬† It was nice to see a smiling Sofia (hostess) every morning.¬† Servers Rhea, Ivy and Ryann were very attentive and were friendly every day.¬†
Chef Aldie walked around the restaurant greeting guests and sharing special desserts on several of the mornings.
The food selection was really good - but as is with most buffets in the Philippines... The temperature of the food was warm at best - and some items (hash browns/potatoes at the start of line) were always cold.¬† Lower temps mean more bacterial issues with food.
** Special note for guests - get down there early (before 7:30am especially on the weekends) to get inside seating otherwise you'll be in the overflow area in the lobby or outside on the terrace overlooking the pool.

We got to meet Hayden Kho and his wife Vivian Belo in the lift one morning going down to breakfast.¬† I didn't know who they were when we entered the lift but my fiance was speechless and starstruck at the same time.

The location is perfect being located next to Ayala Center.¬† We visited the Metro Grocery store several times to stock our room fridge.¬† We also dined at Army Navy Burger (awesome ""California Burger"" - just like ""In-Out Burger"" in the USA), Gerry's, Casa Verde, Burger Haus (great German beer on tap) and TGI Fridays).

Pro's
¬†- Staff - by far just awesome!¬†
 - Location - Location - Location¬† 
 - Room was nice and comfortable¬†
 - Morning Buffet selection and Chef Aldie visiting guests tables¬†
 - Security at every entry - and very friendly

Challenges¬†
 - Room fridges/""chillers"" - if they are not working properly and cooling items to at least 4c they need to be replaced as they are inefficient and wasting electricity.¬†
 - TV channel list / channel availability - needs to be updated when changes occur to programming.¬†
 - Morning Buffet food temperature

Will we stay again? - Absolutely! - We really enjoyed staying here for a second time and look forward to returning.
The staff really make this place shine!",4,2023-08-19

Food needs improvement though.   
The congee is inconsistent, sometimes watery n sometimes thick.  There need to be a better toaster for breads that couldn't fit on slice bread slots. Attended the Seafood Friday, the service catering on servicing the lobster  was not only slow, it was chaotic such that our individual lobsters got mixed up at our table, some of which we didn't even order!

906915018,"As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.

The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled. 

We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and everyone should find something for his taste. Unfortunately, you had to regularly queue and wait until a place has become free. This was not so in previous years, one was then if necessary placed in the lobby, which dan rather reminded of a company canteen. We preferred to have breakfast outside on the terrace. When it rained, however, the water gradually penetrated the ceiling and breakfast was over. It seems that during the renovation a few years ago, the roofs over the terraces were not repaired, one has the feeling that the hotel has saved at the wrong end.

As a conclusion I can say that I will stay again in the hotel, it is still very good standard. However, one has the feeling that as a foreigner married to a Filipina, you have a somewhat heavier stand overall, which you become aware of through many little things, but which can also only be coincidental.

Plus, I also saw a hotel guest ( teenager)  today (July 13, 2023) wearing pajamas and having her breakfast.  It appears that it is an extension of her home living room.

The front office had a security personnel also with me to  check on me while they paid  the bills and bught the  medicine in the hospital pharmacy üåü üåü üåü üåü üåü 

They also updated my wife how my condition was . A+++++ extra professional concern.

Their team waited  and brought me back to the hotel, similar to how they pulled me out, radio on the way and updated the need for the wheelchair, as I went to the lobby at pass 1am, the supervisor asked how I was, the same one that finished her shift responsibility at 11pm, inspite of me appreciation and thanking them, team, she confidently said they finish what they start usually and they are sincerely worried for each guest, emengency or not.

Sincere services and handling the situation, I give them 5 stars. ",5,2023-07-04

899788391,I always stay in Seda when I visit Cebu but this time - December 2022 the place was a bit sad. The parking lot smelled like piss and the walkway towards ayala was not kept clean. The buffet breakfast also had a lot of waiting as they could not accommodate . I suggest you schedule the timings of each floor to help guest plan their time rather than waiting for 30 mins in the lobby to be seated for breakfast.,3,2023-07-02
898809837,"The check-in was a problem. We had to wait until 3:50 pm. I had to cancel my appointment since I had to shower & change & don‚Äôt have time already. Well, lobby manager tried to explain their problem. I‚Äôm the customer & I have the right to demand what I paid. Well, after thorough dialogue with her, her top manager offered us a discount of our stay so I told everybody to just stay & say what happens. So, we prolonged our stay until even today inspite of calling service that towels were not enough, had to cal more toilet paper & even empty body wash was not replaced. I had to call service twice cuz the net fix our w/c got stuck up for some reasons we don‚Äôt know. Maybe previous occupants throw something there that they should not. This happens every time we come back to stay cuz we chose this as our base where we can meet our relatives & friends before another day of spending our vacay. Anyway, thanks for asking for I hope you improve your process. As a Global Consultant for GM for ISO 9000 & 9001 I brought back GM to big profits after almost declaring Chapter 11. Right Process is the key to a profitable business. Good luck ! ",4,2023-06-29
898734319,"PROs:
- Perfect location. Close to all necessities.
- Adjacent to Ayala Center Mall
- Super friendly and helpful staff
- Buffet breakfast  is great
- Apart from the room charge, they give the option of ""paying as u go"" instead of immediately charging u with the hotel deposit for the restaurant and bar bills. 

CONs:
- The pool area can be updated a bit to make it look in keeping with the modern lobby.
- Some of the sofas in the lobby have ""stains"" on them that make them look unsanitary
- The gym had 3 treadmills but only 1 was working

 Last March 2023, I have a close friend who stayed there for 2 nights and she told me how amazed she was with the room service and all ‚Äî we met at their restaurant and had lunch, their food was incredible . One thing we wouldn‚Äôt forget is how the servers had the initiative to transfer us to a different table since we were seated by the window and the sun was directly shining on us. 

Second, I made a reservation for my bestfriend and she was able to check in early which made her happy despite the long flight she had from Canada ‚Äî the next morning she had a 6am major exam and decided to take it at Misto while having her breakfast, my best friend couldn‚Äôt forget the person who served her ‚Äî Angelica, cause despite her early morning exam, Angelica figured and was kind enough to serve her some coffee and food while she was answering. 

And just last April 20 ‚Äî we celebrated my mom‚Äôs birthday at their restaurant and she really had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the variety of food, everything was so delicious, they even sang a birthday song to my mom and gave her a free cake. Surprisingly, Angelica was there and she helped my mom with her halo halo and was kind enough to take our pictures too. Although we had a last minute miscommunication cause we asked for 3 extra teacups since we ordered Green Tea, the one who assisted us probably misunderstood and thought we wanted 3 more Green Tea (in a teapot) ‚Äî but the cashier, Ivy, was honest and quick to realize we actually didn‚Äôt order more Green Tea but asked for cups and made necessary changes for our bill. 

My overall experience is great! They have exemplary service from rooms to restaurants. Would definitely recommend to my friends ‚Äî  place is very convenient and very near the Ayala Mall. Service is very extraordinary especially their restaurant. Thank you, keep it up :)",5,2023-05-28

889519110,"This might literally be the worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in for a long long time. Before I continue my dislike of this hotel, I must say that it is located very nicely beside Ayala mall which is a fantastic mall. Also, the staff have been mostly kind and enthusiastic to us. 

However, I cannot write a review based on what could be, but what I experienced. And what I experienced was mostly torture at nights. Am in their hotel bed as I type this, unable to sleep because they have construction going on at 10:30pm outside. Listening to the sounds of hammers and occasional shouting wasn‚Äôt how I envisioned my nights were going to be at Cebu. My wife and I already had to change rooms once because our first room was exposed to very loud live music coming from the mall from Friday to Sundayl. The second room was ok for abit but come the weekday, the construction has been non stop through the day and now into the night (currently 10:35pm)

If you are travelling to Cebu, you might be looking to go on day trips to nearby provinces like Oslob, Bohol, Moalboal etc and most of these day trips will require you to wake up early ~4-5am. The noise will most definitely make it difficult to do so.

I cannot in good faith recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends. And if you do book this hotel, I pray that you are a heavy sleeper/sleep easily or get a room that is away from the noise.

To add on to this, the hotel itself isn‚Äôt fantastic. You could tell that it had its glory days but it is now old and didn‚Äôt keep up with the times. Soap and shampoo etc feel cheap and the walls and mats are old and outdated. 

Again, good staff and location but I will never ever come back here to stay until maybe the construction is finished in a few years.",1,2023-05-08

Housekeeping needs quality checks. I do not see or hear vacuuming done so guests come in dusty unclean areas. Linens spotted. Stuff shortages as one waits for rooms to be refreshed. For two days now I see one staff responsible for the whole floor of rooms. The only draw here is location as with kids the mall is the destination area and us old folks hate to cross the busy street so we settle for this place.

BUT, the organization is a disaster. This is not a comment on the cleaning/breakfast staff, etc., but management. The gym is big but the ventilation is atrocious - especially because it's located in the basement, without windows. I felt like I was suffocating. The pool was unmanned, even though someone is supposed to tend to it at all times. For the most part we were left to our own devices, which was fine, but it's hard not to feel neglected when it feels like staff is actively avoiding guests.",3,2022-12-18

869507936,"This was the previous Marriot Hotel on Ayala Cebu. We have always stayed at this Hotel in previous visits because of its location. Now it has become a cedar and this is the first time we stayed here since the change. Upon checking in it was obvious that they were understaffed. There were only two people in the front desk and it was a long wait before we were checked in. Bill service was also very slow. We were told that our luggage will be brought up right away however after waiting for 15 minutes And after calling for our luggage,my husband had to go down and said he will bring the luggage up himself if they were not going to do it. 

The room itself was decent however the air conditioning was poor. It did not matter what temperature we set the thermostat at it seemed it was stuck at 23 degrees Centigrade.

The lounge service was excellent with a good selection of food and drinks.

If you go to the bar you have to look for the bartender which could take several minutes. They also had a hard time making the drinks we ordered

i prepared my laptop to work on the desk..I walked over to the ref.  Two visitors (cockroaches) come crawling up the freaking wall and scared my kid. 

Staff who cleaned the room BARGED in to our other room. This was without knocking or ringing the doorbell. He simply felt at home and walked in while I was sitting on the desk working.

The staff are a credit to the hotel, all staff that I interacted with, from the door man to the room cleaners, were 1st class.the room was a very good size, bed was very large and excellent condition. Bathroom and shower was very good and all very clean. Room comes with a fridge and safe. The cleaner will replenish your water supply everyday.

Small bar but a large restaurant, which I used several times. It does take a long while for food and drink to turn up, even when there is nobody else around and several staff. I would have eaten and drank here more if the service was faster. Food was generally very tasty, however, the Sisig was very oily and pork was very crunchy. A shame as that is one of my favourite dishes here in the Philippines.

There is a small pool which was never busy and sun loungers. Again, all clean and tidy. 

I used the gym most days but this is the are of the hotel that is in need of modernising. All equipment is very old, most failing apart in some way and the air conditioning in the gym area was very poor. The air con in the rest of the hotel was excellent so it must be broken in the gym for it to be that hot and stuffy. Not what you want when you want to work out. 

Check out was a bit slow and would not want to check out when the hotel was busier.

At one point I called to verify my car service and after making me spell my name multiple times she told me I did not have car service scheduled. However, when I rushed down to the front desk, I did indeed have car service scheduled.

At breakfast I had to wait an extremely long time for tea, even when it arrived they still had not brought my friends coffee. No one ever refilled the water.

Worst of all they did an internet upgrade and as a result the cable tv service was out the entire next day.

Check out was miserable. I stood in line behind one person for over 10 minutes. Then it took me forever to get checked out because they sort through multiple pieces of paper‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs an antiquated system that is not appropriate for a 12 story hotel.",3,2022-08-19

While there‚Äôs a wide selection of items for everyone, someone in our party had dietary restrictions and allergies. No problem - kitchen staff asked what he could eat, then made it. We enjoyed the gym (there‚Äôs a sauna!), pool and proximity to pretty much everything.

The first time i stayed there was no internet.  This second time,  i was given a room with an adjoining room,  divides by one of those creepy doors,  where you don't know its secure. Why in the world you don't know who i am,  my first lousy experience,  then you put me here in this room. The guy next door waa snoring in my ear and his TV blasting all night. The front desk tries hard and work hard,  as do support staff.  I suspect the problem ia management. My CR had no shower glass or curtain divider. That made the shower water cover the entire CR.  What kind of hotel does this to a customer???!! This is just stupid Gwen.!! How would you like to walk around in wet like you're at a swimming pool. It also takes 30 mins to run the water to a warm temperature! The food at the buffet was cold,  not warm,  many dishes were not heated.  This hotel is good for one thing.  Location to the mall and shopping entertainment and food. But the hotel is far below it's good looks. Thats all it is.  Aside from the decore,  youre taking your chances.

PROS
*Upon entering the hotel, you will be greeted with their friendly staff. Queenie helped us during check in and granted our request to be at the upper floor for less noise and to have a good view of the city.

*The hotel is modern and the color scheme is refreshing to the eyes. It smelled good too. The sheets were clean and the room looked really nice. It had the usual amenities. 

*Breakfast starts at 6am. The food selection isn't that wide but the food tasted really good. Try their HOT CHOCOLATE. Super sarap! That was the best hot chocolate I tasted in years. 

*Ayala Center Cebu is just beside the hotel. It practically is walking distance. This I enjoyed the most. I shopped and walked back to the hotel. 

CONS
*Room didn't have bathrobes and iron

They quickly moved me to another room, which was great. But if I am paying that much of amount, I expect that this should never happen. 

On the brighter side, their staff were extremely helpful. Breakfast was great. But not enough seating so I had to wait (and other guests too) to be accommodated for the morning buffet.

836012509,"Stayed for 4 nights and had 3 rooms for the first night. Service was good and very helpful. But rooms needs to be renovated, the linens and the towels needs to be replaced. Had to asked for white towels instead of the dirty white color, everyday i have to request for whiter than the almost grey towels and hand towels. When i was handed the hand towel, i thought it was a bath mat because of how old and used it was. Wanted to move to the other Seda bc it was newer but they were fully booked. Seda ayala knowing our disappointment with their facilities upgraded us to club floors but it also does not have the whiter towels too. As much as i like the location and the service, i will not go back‚Ä¶.",3,2022-04-25

834886541,Great location. Just beside Ayala Center Cebu. The Wifi is poor though. Only 10 Mbps and not secured. Not enough for work-related tasks. Had issue with our room where the sofa and the cabinet smells bad like they didn't cleaned it up.,4,2022-04-17
834602132,The hotel location is very convenient as it is just beside Ayala. Breakfast buffet had many good options. Staff were friendly and helpful. The room had everything we need and the bed was really comfortable. Overall a wonderful stay. ,5,2022-04-15
833547303,"Clean. 10 out of 10 whether it's the room, lobby or restau.

Comfortable. 10 out 10 in terms of sleep quality coz of the big bed, pillows and lighting.

Consistently reliable. Staff are always at their best no matter what time of the day.",5,2022-04-05

833329678,"Great and accommodating staff at Reception (Thank you, Queenie!) and at Misto restaurant (Thank you, Junel/ Juvel). The hotel location was convenient, being a stone‚Äôs throw from the Ayala mall (whose management/ ownership the property may have shared) and a quick cab ride from meetings. The hotel bathroom though lacked some safety considerations such as a safety rubber mat in the shower. I had just stayed in Seda Iloilo two weeks before and my room there had the safety rubber mat and a cleaner bathroom and room. I expected more because of the higher price of the room in Seda Cebu versus Seda Iloilo. ",4,2022-04-03
833100395,"From the time the hotel was marriott until it became SEDA, still my personal choice to stay when in Cebu.  Location is great, great service maintained and eveb improved when it became SEDA.  Nice if they had adjoining rooms available for a family travelling with bigger kids.  Airport - hotel transfers are great, a hotel rep is available within the arrival area and will assist until the vab",5,2022-04-01
831932831,"Train your staff again. Even the cleaning staff needs training.... they used the bath towels to clean the floors of the toilet.... this is grose. And they pick up the trash, clean the toilet & fold the bed linens & bath towels without changing the hand gloves... its very unsanitary... yet the pandemic is still here.",2,2022-03-21
831502897,I stayed for 3days for my business trip for the first time after quarantine restriction. Not only close both to offices and shopping mall. Staffs are friendly and attentive. I was able to pleasant dinners for entire stay from late time.,4,2022-03-17

830147118,"Ok, near the mall. Good for staycation. Try their happy hour. Breakfast is good, for dinner, the ala cart is better than buffet. Pool is ok. Gym ok, but at the basement. Friendly staff. Ok conference area.",4,2022-03-05
829971833,First time to avail of such accomodation at Cebu CIty - excellent services and faciltiies. Hotel was quick to make up room as requested and sufficient supplies are provided. Very generous also in allowing late check out,5,2022-03-03

Great people, great value, great location. Will definitely come back in future trips.",5,2022-02-26
829082595,"room did not have a wow effect when you come in, incomplete important amenity, old fllty towels, no bidet, hard to call househeeping, front desk & no turndowns even you requested it using the button. not even knock on the door. 2 small rolls toilet papers are not enough for 2 nights stay for 2 people specially no bidet installed. I resorted to asking friends in other guests rooms if they have extra toilet paper. no facial tissues to blow you nose with. 

I like the cozy bed. bfast buffet is fine but not the ala cart menu, we ended up eating outside after our lunch experiences at the hotel.",3,2022-02-24
828200133,"The staffs are courteous, hotel sanitation is good tho the aircon/ventilation at the lobby is quite warm (which is understandable since it's still pandemic and continuous closed ventilation is still a factor for transmission) bedroom is cozy and well sanitized. Free breakfast buffet at Misto restaurant is amazing! I only have one quite undesirable comment about not having a bidet and/or tabo on the room's toilet & bath which is super essential for filipino tourists like me (tissue paper are well stocked tho). Overall stay was amazing and I would definitely stay again here the next time I visit Cebu. Just make sure to book on advance so that you'll have great deal for the hotel's rate. Thanks a lot!",4,2022-02-16
827907109,"It was a comfortable 3-night stay at Seda. Staff made sure we were aptly attended to despite COVID restrictions. Seda is a choice of convenience due to its location, and one‚Äôs stay is made hassle-free and comfortable because of the staff. Indeed, Seda, in the time of COVID, lives up to the adage human resource is the best resource.",4,2022-02-13

God Bless",5,2022-01-27
825226606,"I would not recommend this place to anyone or anybody. customer service and the place itself is an utter failure. Dirty place and Customer Service sucks. 

Weeks prior to our departure back in US, we booked this place and got it for less than $70.00 per night since they are on promo. 
Hours upon arrival, they changed the rate to $100.00 per night since the promo is no longer available. 

again, I don't mind paying $100.00 per night if the service is good. However, management can't even keep up the customer's needs. for exmaple; they  can't even provide a good quality shower soap and we thought it was a good quarantine hotel. 

to make long story short, please... avoid this place.",1,2022-01-17

824850263,"Genuine courtesy and welcoming vibe from staff. Direct access to Ayala Centre. The room does not have a chemical or artificial freshener smell, even the fabrics. I'm sensitive to dust and their ac didn't give me any discomfort. I t feels so clean and comfortable. How nice that they included a sanitizer spray on their complimentary hygine kit. The toiletries are of good quality. The only hiccup was when my booking through Agoda didn't go to their system, so checkin took a bit longer. Everything else is great.",5,2022-01-13
824535582,Spent my mandatory quarantine in Seda Ayala Center Cebu last 8 Dec-13 Dec 2021. Everything went smooth from the time I was picked up from Mactan Airport to check-in til swab day then check-out. I had an amazing and peaceful time during my quarantine. Food served was superb too!
