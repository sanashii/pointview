955865764,"rooms are simple with a luxurious feel to them. you will not run out of things to do in the resort. you can either go for a swim on the beach or in the pools, there's a basketball / volleyball court, there's an area for indoor sports like pingpong and billiards. note however that swimming on the beach isn't allowed from 6 pm onwards. the resort is along a busy strip of various establishments including several supermarkets and convenience stores, some of which are open 24/7.",5,2024-06-19
955161577,"The check-in process was fast, and early check-in was allowed since it was available. The first impression of the hotel showed it looked a bit aged, but it is still in good condition and usable. The room was large, and the bathroom was spacious. However, the room lacked a welcoming vibe on the first day, which was unexpected for a 5-star hotel. The outdated carpet design and antique chairs in front of the elevators contributed to the aged appearance.

The balcony provided a relaxing view of greenery, even though it was far from the beach. kids thoroughly enjoyed the playroom and Pororo Park, although the latter was quite expensive for its medium size. The pools were big and enjoyable, and the lazy river was a highlight. The resort offers a variety of entertainment facilities such as mini-golf, a playground, an activity room, go-karts, and slides. The toddlers‚Äô pool was particularly loved by the kids, and the Amazon River attraction was a standout feature. Various water activities are also available, adding to the fun.

Food prices were on the higher side with an average taste, but the serving sizes were acceptable. There are many nearby restaurants if you prefer dining out. The buffet breakfast was average, and the lunch buffet restaurant itself felt too expensive for the limited selection. However, the 100% natural juice was a highlight. The restaurant personnel were very professional and well-trained. Room service was available through a barcode menu only, with no printed copies, which did not attract us to dine in our room.

The pool design has areas with varying depths, so children need to be supervised carefully. The Wi-Fi was strong but unusable in the rooms, which was a significant inconvenience. It is recommended that someone from management check in for one night with an iPhone to personally experience and address the Wi-Fi issues along with any other areas needing improvement. The poolside entertainment, including Zumba, live singing, and a fire dance, was a delightful addition, and hot towels were provided after swimming.

Additional facilities such as a fitness center, spa, and gym are available, along with huge function halls. Other amenities include an ATM, casino, and photo studio. However, gift shops and necessity shops were hard to find. The presence of ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù signs in the room was unusual and a bit annoying for a 5-star establishment. The staff were helpful and responsive to complaints, making efforts to address any issues seriously. Both check-in and check-out processes were fast and efficient.

THIS ""KOREAN-CENTERED"" HOTEL IN CEBU, DOES NOT HAVE EVEN THE SIMPLEST INSTANT RAMYUN  NOODLE OPTION FOR THEIR GUESTS. 

As early as a little past 10pm, this establishment is saying they don't have the most basic korean instant noodles available. When to most hotels in Cebu, it is in fact something offered in their minibars on each room. 

Most appalling is the service of everyone at this time. All their staff just simply saying they dont offer it because their ""convenience store"" closes at 10pm.

946010172,"We visited J Park as day guests and I cannot help but compare my experience to that of a day guest at the Shangri La. Firstly the price of the day pass was exorbitant. The staff at the day use desk and the guests at J Park were just so unhappy. I was actually shocked by it. We have been travelling all over the Phillipines and everyone is so friendly and happy. Not at this place! Guests look so sour, I mean you are in the Phillipines would it kill you to smile. The facilities are OK. OK pool, we opted for buffet dinner at the Abalone restaurant and the staff were attentive and the food plentiful. We paid 500 pesos to use the little cars for 30 minutes and 100 pesos to use the go carts for 15 minutes. Pool staff were lovely and attentive and the lifeguards were exceptional. My kids spent all day in the water and we just lounged around. This hotel seems to cater especially for guests from Korea whereas Shangri La had a more international crowd. I would advise you take the dinner option rather than the lunch set menu. Seeing the place in the night was a different perspective, pororo meets the kids and there was a fire show. Still didn't justify the cost, it was an ok experience and I probably would not visit again.",2,2024-04-09
945247766,Best Hotel resort for family. Very good and spacious  water park. Water park attendant and lifeguards were very attentive. Professional and Friendly check in Hotel staff. Highly recommended for families. Surely your kids will love it. Highly recommended.,5,2024-04-03
944233523,"We had a memorable staycation at Jpark. It was our baby girl's birthday and she had a marvelous time. 
As a family that loves to travel together, we have tried almost all the good beach resorts in Lapu-lapu city, Cebu. There are negative things we noticed immediately upon arriving at the resort. One, most of the areas in the resort needs maintenance and cleaning. The pools looked clean but the drains were really dirty. However, the pros to Jpark are more than enough to make your stay great! We stayed in a big room with a King bed at the new Jpark Tower. Even with a kingsize bed, chair with stool, baby cot/crib AND and extra bed the room was still very spacious. Big enough for our infant to crawl around when we stayed in the room. We are impressed with the room size however, as with the rest of the resort, it also needs maintenance. We did not have hot water for showering but its not a big deal. What the Resort have that overly compensates for its shortcomings is the CUSTOMER SERVICE and their FOOD. They have a good variety of good food with reasonable prices. We ate at our favorite Nonki and Maru restaurants and tried their chinese Ching Hai restaurant. We have breakfast at Abalone and snacks at Aquos and before we left ate at the Coral restaurant. They all have tasty and good for value foods. But the best part about this resort is their customer service. Most of their staff were accommodating and non-discriminating between foreigners and locals. However some staff were above standard and made the extra effort to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Miss Jomarie at the reception front desk made us feel welcome right from our arrival. She listened to all our requests and did all that she can to accommodate. Kevin at the infinity pool was also noteworthy. As simple as offering to help inflate our baby floaters gave us more time to enjoy playing with our kids. And before we left, Bingbong of the Abalone restaurant left an unforgetable impression to our family and made us think we want to come back just to eat at the Coral Restaurant. He and Mario gave Excellent service and Bingbong later offered the kids to a fishfeeding experience. He took our family photos with enthusiasm and when we said thank you his response was unforgettable. He said ""No, i should be the one to thank you because you chose Jpark Resort"". Amazing! 

The thing also worth mentioning is the Pororo Park. Aside from being ridiculously expensive (2,000 pesos for 2 hours), i felt that it was not worth the extra spend with all the fun things we can do outside (the weather was amazing) instead of indoors.",4,2024-03-28
939519517,"JPark was amazing. We have a 4 yr old and a 7 yr old and their minds were blown by the water park. It was fun, well-maintained and very safe and well-staffed by lifeguards. The hotel itself was beautiful and very impressive. The staff was knowledgeable and helpful and the food was excellent (both in the Abalone and Naku restaurants). It was a wonderful time and I would totally recommend it.",5,2024-02-23
933971714,"The rooms were dated. Service was poor as well. We arrived late and when we got to the room, there were no towels. We had to call housekeeping to send up towels and repeatedly call because it look long.  During breakfast, the buffet is crowded and tables can be left messy, they also look long to tidy up the tables. 

The only redeeming thing about this property are the pools and the nightly show by the pool.",3,2024-01-14
932912195,"Take all the other reviews for what they are. For a ‚Äú5 start‚Äù resort it was terrible. Probably really good and convenient for families with kids however, I had no hot water for the entire 5 nights I stayed there, the internet didn‚Äôt work meaning I couldn‚Äôt work from the room and because the tv is connected to the internet, that didn‚Äôt work either. You‚Äôre basically paying top dollar for a bed to sleep in (which mine also had stained sheets). The room smelt damp and needed a refurb. Everything is also twice the price. ",2,2024-01-08

930254345,"I have stayed at JPark 3 times over the last 5 years. Most recently with my wife and kids.

At a high level it looks like the perfect resort to stay at with kids. The problem is the place is going downhill fast and the owners are not doing proper maintenance.

We had three rooms this weekend and all of them smelled terrible like mildew or mold or something. The kind of smell that hits you in the face when you walk in the room.

The resort clearly needs new carpet.

The TVs in the room are very small and the system it uses is ancient and not a good experience.

The WiFi was terrible. Unusable.

I went back to my room at midnight one night and couldn't get in my own room. The key card wouldn't work. I had to go to the front desk to get a new key. With amazing Filipino hospitality they even walked me back to my room to assist me. 

We then figured out about 30 minutes later that the problem was my hotel room door didn't properly close. The key card wouldn't work because the door wasn't actually locked. The only way to lock the door was to slam it hard. The door jam didn't line up. The poor guy helping me from the front desk couldn't even figure out what was wrong.

One of the best things about JPark is the nice hot shower. That is something that is hard to find in the Philippines. Sadly, the faucet in the same bathroom was leaking and needed to be replaced. Maintenance not being performed.

The pool is one thing that is functional but you can see paint fading due to lack of upkeep. The pools are excellent and probably the only reason they are in business.

The buffet is a strength for the resort but it is pretty expensive for the Philippines. It's around $30 a person. Overall the food was great.

Pororo Park is about $30 for you and all the real rides and attractions were for whatever reason closed when I was there. Basically we got a playground, trampoline, some building blocks, a water table, and slide for $30. It did keep my son busy for an hour so I still consider it a win.

There is no beach at JPark. There is some sand and then rocks in the water. Don't expect any sort of good beach experience at JPark. Go somewhere else or island hopping if you want a dream beach experience.

When we went before the D Thrones ride on cars were one of my favorite parts. Now they best summarize the entirety of JPark.

They are all broken and no longer available. The amusing part is there are still signs all over the grounds about them. They are too lazy to fix or replace them and then too lazy to at least take the signs down about them.

JPark could be a 5 star resort. Right now it is exactly O.K. and honestly only in business because it doesn't have any real competition. It's super popular for Korean tourists for some reason.

The management team needs to get it together and do proper maintenance. ",3,2023-12-19

918768006,"Please avoid staying here overnight. The pools are really good. I would suggest day use. However do not stay here overnight. It is overpriced for what you get. You have to pay for everything other than the pool - mini golf, billiards, table tennis etc. Our shower only has cold water. You can imagine how much fun that was with a 2 year old. The lift is really slow and even when I was holding down the ‚Äòdoor open‚Äô button, it still closed on our daughters fingers, causing her to cry. The staff are nice but some discriminate against the locals. Rooms are old and carpets are dirty. The food is overpriced and tastes really bad. The beach is shelly - advise to wear flip flops or crocs. Can‚Äôt believe this is a 5 star resort. It‚Äôs 3 at best. ",1,2023-09-27

914923212,"As 5 star hotel they have failed their standard terribly! Beddings were full of stains even when changed the 2nd time. Their room sofas were full of stains too. Bathroom curtains were full of moulds and looked dirty. When u sit on the toilet bowl and you will  see at eye level the underneath of the bathroom sink we‚Äôre full of black slimy moulds. I have to call the maintenance team to clean it, but they couldn‚Äôt since it has been there for too long already that it was to hard for them to remove it. Staff in the kitchen or restaurant servers needs proper training for hygiene and proper handling of food and kitchen materials such as plates,  utensils glasses etc. The price we pay is doesn‚Äôt much to my expectation with the room I‚Äôm staying.

909905864,"While we had initially looked forward to a comfortable and enjoyable stay, our experience took a distressing turn due to an unfortunate incident involving our 4-year-old daughter. In the morning after, we discovered that our child had sustained numerous insect bites, particularly on her face. 

Upon reflection, we strongly suspect that the source of these insect bites might have been the pillow in the room. Our daughter had placed her face on the pillow during her sleep, and the fact that the majority of the bites were concentrated on her face lends credence to this suspicion. We are deeply concerned about the cleanliness and hygiene standards within the room, especially given the severity of the issue and the potential health risks associated with insect bites.",2,2023-08-13
908993264,"Stayed from 22nd to 24th July.

This is a fantastic resort, built especially for families. The grounds are very well maintained, and there's plenty to do. 

We only sampled the buffet breakfast, but that was amazing. So much to choose from!

The rooms are clean and bright. I stayed in a deluxe sea view room, and my family stayed in a large family room. I have to say that I thought the family room looked better, although it lacked the sea view.

All in all we thoroughly enjoyed our time at Jpark, and I'd definitely recommend it.",5,2023-08-09
905850523,"We celebrated my grandma's 80th birthday there and had a really great time. The villas were very comfortable and spacious which was nice, especially for my grandparents.

905216821,"Disappointed that this hotel was listed as a 5 star property. I will begin with the check in process. It was quick. We got our room fairly fast but I wasn‚Äôt pleased when I went for a swim & ordered a drink at the swim up bar &  my rm# & name  wasn‚Äôt given the option to do room charge as form of payment. In my wet swim suit attire I had to walk to the front desk to ask why. I was then told by the front desk receptionist that the reason why was I had to  pay a 9,000 PHP charge on our account to proceed. This wasn‚Äôt even communicated to me. And that was when my frustration grew. If we knew this we would‚Äôve saved ourselves the embarrassment & waste of time at the pool bar. I mean after all a 5 star property would offer that experience as a courtesy, speaking of the room charge that is. It was embarrassing. The property could use a face lift at that. Including our Pool Villa. It smelled like a public toilet the whole time. I even called the front desk to have someone spray the bathroom so it wouldn‚Äôt smell like feces or a cesspool of a sewer. The decor of the pool was also a let down as some faux grass boards were missing but without it that detail showed sub par contracting work. It just screamed negligence in addition to the moss forming on the door corners. The concept of the pool villa was cool but for 5 minutes and I would honestly recommend it for 1 night only to experience a private pool. The upkeep or the feeling of this room to feel stress free & clean isn‚Äôt worth it. We ordered IRD a couple of times (we stayed from here 7/19- 7/22) and when asked a room service staff member if they could pick up the dirty dishes after we ate they told me ‚Äúmaybe if it‚Äôs not raining‚Äù. This is unacceptable. Another night we ordered from Nonki, the Japanese Restaurant apart of the resort and due to a private function take out was the only option. But when our family of 4 was done eating we had to put all the garbage outside of our room because we had bags worth of trash not picked up. We heard the street cats digging into the bags in the middle of the night.  
I really wanted to have a great experience here with my family however it was the opposite. I recommend not taking the pool Villa for more than 1x night. You‚Äôre better off getting a clean smelling room. Over all I‚Äôd say JPark is definitely a novelty resort for kids but don‚Äôt expect 5 star service. Expect 3.5 and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The Pororo Park is great for small children, my 7 month old enjoyed it as well as my 4 year old but best to enjoy when the 3h window begins at 1500 php per kid. I hope this place improves. I won‚Äôt be returning though.",2,2023-07-24
905143155,"2nd time at jpark.  My kids contracted hand foot mouth disease starting with my toddler who only went to pororo park and the water park. After reading other reviews it seems like it happens quite often here. Most likely from pororo park. Emailed reservations about it over a week ago. No reply. Very disappointing from a supposedly 5 star hotel which it definitely is not thus the 1 star. Management should look into their customer service or rather lack of it. 

Lifeguards on the red swirling slide  and the blue slide were also not careful and hit my daughter on the head twice. 

Facilities need upkeep. Wave pool and other slides not working. 

Water is overpriced. 110 for a small bottle of regular bottled water. More expensive than shang mactan.

Transfer from the airport was pre-booked and worked flawlessly when I approached the Jpark booth at the airport. The rooms are good and clean. Hint: go to breakfast early. The restaurant is great, but it gets a bit crowded after 7 am. Some pools are closed by 6 pm, but the main pool still is open for a relaxing swim after work. The choice of restaurants is great, I liked the ""Havana by the Sea"" with a beautiful view and live music. Outside the resort there are some more restaurants (simpler and cheaper) and a supermarket.

I had an experience before that I was discriminated in this certain resort here in Cebu where they thought I was just a random person (not a hotel guest) who is exploring the place.

894579032,"Great resort to take your kids!

Good: Lots of activities to do. The waterpark was fun for the kids. My 11-year old loved the slides. 

Breakfast food was ok, more impressive though was despite the resort being fully booked, there were more than enough tables for the guests.

Restaurant food were good but like any hotel resorts, price is on the high end. I actually loved the Japanese restaurant just outside the main Jpark building. 

Room was nice. Nothing special but bust comfortable enough to get your rest after a whole day of swimming and playing.

Pororo Park was fun for the kids, but quite a pain on the parents‚Äô pockets‚Ä¶I think they can lower the cost a bit and then lessen the time spent (instead of 3 hours maybe just 2).

Needs improvement: Towels! Only resort I‚Äôve been to where there are always lack of beach/pool towels for the guests. One time we went there around 7:30am (pool opens at 7am) and the towels were not ready yet!

893930224,"We stayed here 4 days and 3 nights here for the children's birthday trip. Our booking is a package for their Mactan Suite with breakfast, spa, cocktails at the Hacana By The Bay and discounts for other amenities. Prior arrival, I made sure during reservation that a birthday set-up will be prepared in the room ( to suprise my children and make them feel special for their birthday vacation), to my suprise, as per Reservation, they do not offer such thing ( taje note, I am a hotelier mysrlf and all hotels have different birthday set-up to make guest feel special during their stay) Jpark is a 5 star waterpark resort so I guess i expected a lot. Anyway, I then just ask for a cake which i will pay,to be placed in the room before we arrive. Arrival, room is not ready due to high occupancy, so I reminded the Front office regarding the set-up i made with the Reservation. When the room is finally ready, the cake i arranged was not there. I made a follow up in their Call Center at around 3 30pm and was tild to wait for a feedback. Hours passed, no call was returned to me. We are preparing to leave to meet the family for a dinner outside the resort. Then we heard a knock and when i opened tge door, there was a delivery of a cake. I asked the waiter on who ordered the cake, he answered that it is complimentary to our room. Now im confused, the suprise cake was never arranged as agreed, the cake i followed up never got clarified for hours, now, complinentary cake? I have to discuss it with the management to clear things out. Gladly, Mr,Ryan Garcia ( Duty Manager) was there to hwar my confusion and complaints. He gave me rhe assurance that it will be discussed and investigated.  Thanks ro him our firsr visit and first night  in the resort didn't end up tragic and disappointing.
Fast forward to the rest of our stay. The kids enjoyed the slides and Amazon ricer a lot. But you must be prepared to be early even if the slides opens at 10am . Towels are already lying on the pool beds when you get there late.  Breakfast is a feast but again, you have to be prepared to line up and see a lot of people. They do have very high occupancy during our stay,especially with korean groups. The room we had waa very spacious because we booked a suite, we noticed some dirt issues in the barhroom but aside thatbthe room was comfortable enough. We also had a spa at Cara Spa which me and my husband enjoys a lot, it is an high-end facility where you will feel like a queen and king with their service and facility. 

Cuatomer Service, front office 3/5 ( lacks communication skills and empathy) , call center 2/5 (all calls i made that needed call back never happened cake, water dipper) Restaurant 5/5 (they are cery friendly and helps all guest as possible)

Overall, 3.5/5 for our entire stay, it ciuld have been worse if not for Mr. Rran. I wished we couls thank him personally but was not able to. Will we come back? Possibly,because the kids had fun but we are hoping they will be able to improve on all the lapses they had. ",4,2023-06-07
892599765,"1. Pools look neglected and not well maintained, it's full of dried leaves and plastics as well. I saw some algae at corners of the pool and some odd stuffs at bottom.
2. The room is dusty and smells weird. Me and my kids started to sneeze and cough few moments we enter the room.
3. During the room cleaning, we are asked they first if we want the bedsheet to be changed which is I think should be automatically changed. No sweeping or vacuuming of the floor was done.
4. There's no food menu in the room. We have to call and follow up every 20 mins for the menu to be sent. The food is good and fast.
5. We call for an extra towel on the first day for the kids but nothing was sent. We request again on the second day and made follow every 20 mins finally they sent it.
6. There are some activities that has to be paid by cash on the spot and don't allow us to charge to our room. It's a bit troublesome to bring lots of cash around the resort. I don't understand what is the purpose of our deposit.
7.  The shower drain is always clogged we have to call staff to fix it every time.  We have to follow up every 20 mins before someone comes to fix it.  We have to put our shower time on hold because of that.",1,2023-05-30

890308387,"3rd time visiting this property and it was terrible. We used our ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù in the Cabanas  during the visit. When my Mom order some foods, she was decline that they can‚Äôt serve foods from other outlets and was only offered the pica2x. I was shocked since our previous visit we ordered the same foods and it was served in the cabanas. 

When I arrived, they only ordered the pica2x. So I asked one of the servers that we will order our usual foods that we like. I told them that we are in Cabana 1 and we would like to request for a staff to take our orders in the Cabana. I presumed they are busy since it is Mother‚Äôs Day today so my sister went to Abalone to order. My sister was told that they can only offer take out orders even if they are told we are staying in the Cabana. 

After 1 hour, no one approached us if the foods were ready to pick up. When I went to the towel counter thats the time I was informed that our order was ready to pick up. When I arrived in Abalone, I asked the cashier what time the foods were ready and she said it was ready 15 minutes ago. I asked them why they did not informed me and she just answered she called the towel counter but the staff there did not do anything. I asked her if they can send some glass of water in the cabana and she just said to ask one of the staff near the pool. So they can‚Äôt even assist me with my request. Where is the service here?. (They are not busy when I arrived since 80% of the tables were empty!)

When we started eating, they prepared plastic spoon and fork in the take away plastic. No plates!. What is this, Fast Food service?!. No initiative to provide us a better plates, and utensils when they know we are in the Cabana. 

They lack training. No follow through, No Initiative, and No Genuine care. To think today is Mother‚Äôs Day. I spoke to their F&B Manager and told him everything. Our previous visit was very good compared to our visit today is 1 out of 10. He insisted to give a service recovery but thats not the purpose why I requested for a manager. He was persistent so I requested for a glass of ice instead. 

Be consistent with your service. Hopefully when we visit again (IF), there is an improvement done. ",1,2023-05-14

879379067,"We booked this resort as a 6-night family holiday with our 3yr old daughter.

This is a huge resort with a beautiful waterpark and quite a few things to do.

Check-in was fast and easy. The desk clerk even allowed my wife to physically see some rooms so we could choose the one that best suited our needs.

We got a 1 bedroom sea-view room that had plenty of space complete with a small balcony and an area to hang our wet swimsuits and towels.

The room was clean and well-furnished.
The kitchen area had a sink, kettle, and a countertop to eat lunch if you ordered room service.
Off to the side is a half bath, great for not having to go into the bedroom to use the toilet.

The bedroom was large with a walk-through closet and separate toilet area as well as a separate oversize bathtub and shower area.
The water pressure was excellent, so having a nice warm shower after swimming all day was comforting.

There are a few different restaurants to choose from, but be cautious as the prices on the menu won't be the same on your bill. There are added taxes and surcharges so be sure to watch out for them and inquire immediately to your server or restaurant manager.

The Coral restaurant right on the ocean is calming and has beautiful views, the perfect setting for a nice dinner. The food was of good quality as well.

The staff was ALL friendly and nice, with no issues at all.

The breakfast buffet is huge and offers a lot of different dishes and drinks.

There is a small entertainment in the evenings beside the main pool consisting of fire dancers and 2 female singers.

There are a lot of stores and restaurants outside the resort, just walk out the gate and there are all over the place.

The waterpark has areas for all ages. Since our daughter is 3, we stayed around the kiddie area where there are many slides and water activities. She also loved the river rafts, that went in a circle and had fun getting wet from all the sprinkles throughout the course.

There is a casino on the site but the minimum bet is $20usd chips.

We had a very good time and would highly recommend this to other families that are looking for a nice relaxing holiday.

- Food from restaurant are always good
- The resort employees are pleasant and eager to assist you right away.
- Few, yet sturdy and relaxing hammocks

Just Okay
- The pool is not very deep, most likely for safety reasons, but it is still enjoyable.
- The beach sand area is too small, not advisable to use on peak days

863238651,"My wife and I live in Cebu city. Our building took a hit from Odette. We have lived with construction noise for months. So we needed a getaway. I paid the most I ever have paid for a hotel in the Philippines and booked a M-F room at this hotel. The place was on the wife‚Äôs bucket list.  With my booking I sent a request for a quiet room. I got a form letter response. That annoyed me, what kind of customer service is that for a 5 star ? So I sent an e mail through the site I booked the hotel. No response. Now I was mad so I sent an e mail to the web site of J Park, no reply. Finally I sent Jason Wu‚Äôs food company an e mail to be forwarded to him telling the millionaire owner his customer service stunk. No response. When we checked in I told the woman who checked me in I tried repeatedly to get a human response to my request for a quiet room and never got a response. So I told her all I care about is a quiet room. Well we check in go to the pool come back are settling into our room and WHAM super loud disco and an obnoxiously loud MC coming from an event by the pool. My head exploded. No blackout curtains in a room that faced the sun and no soundproofing in the room.  I complained and was told initially that I was given a schedule of events when I checked in. It was not until telling the hotel manager I would have any further conversation with his superiors we were offered a room upgrade. We transferred the next day to a quiet room with blackout curtains the room had what once must have been a beautiful ocean themed rug but how would you know it was filthy. Some Five star. The towels in the room were Motel 6 quality. I mean come on a Five star with heinous towels ? The hits just kept on coming. 4 days we were there not once did the water in the shower get hot. You are a supposed Five star with a beach and pools and you have awful towels and no hot water in the bathrooms‚Ä¶..some Five star. My wife loved the breakfast which had great COVID protocols me ? Four days every day my eggs were cold. How do you have a hot plate a warming light and the eggs are cold ? Usually Five stars have an omelet station here no so much. Coffe which I always expect to be awesome at a five star was Folgers quality meh. Oh the food story gets better we went to the Japanese resturant by the front gate it was the only superior meal we had the wife‚Äôs fish and my sashimi and sushi were quite good. The other place Coral very hit or miss. One night we had the best nacho‚Äôs I have had since living in Cebu, but the shrimp we ordered were rubber. Last night there the wife had a very nice crab meal, my entree was served with cold vegetables. This stuff is resturant 101 how does a supposed Five star consistently serve cold or substandard food ? They charge you not cheaply for the food there are expectations involved here. So make your expectations very low for food at this place. One note from the pics it looks like a white sand beach. The beach is all rocks. You need water shoes which I did not have. I cut my foot and the bottoms of my feet hurt for days afterwards so remember your ocean slippers. All in all we got what we came for. The wife and my boy loved the water park and the sea. The grounds are lovely the staff almost too helpful. I still do not understand how there is always someone around to take my empty plate or cater to me but every time I ordered a cocktail it took 15 minutes to arrive, I needed to order my second when the first arrived, sadly I was not that smart. So remember you pay for the kIds. Me the person who has stayed at other five stars and paid the most for a hotel room in the Philippines ever ‚Ä¶.I felt robbed. Hijacked. There are three or four other places on the same island just as good for half the price. Whomever is in charge of giving out stars for this place obviously was paid off or the resort bribed a service to be called a five star it is a three star at best.",3,2022-10-05

Unfortunately we havent checked the resort again before booking. Heres my take...
Slides and other parts of the resort is under maintainance/ repair...its quite understandable esp after being hit by a strong typhoon several months ago, but they shouldve advised us and set our expectation before us finalizing our booking. 
Staff - though they are couteous, it couldve been better if they greet their clients proactively.  The pool staff should not be staying in one place  3 to 4  of them, just talking. 
Theres a lot of part of the resort arr also deteriorating esp the rails going up the slides.

We had booked a Villa with private pool for the two weeks which was great being able to walk straight out of the bedroom into the pool on a morning.

We tried all but one of the restaurants in the hotel as well as in room dining, all was good and tried all sorts of food that had not tried before, especially local Philippine dishes as that was one reason for visting there.

Getting around the area was mostly by the use of taxi, for which there was a lot around, as well as wanting, and succeeding, trying the local trikes.

They even attempted to offer us a room that was declined by the other guests. It was very insulting! They said that our room is not ready yet despite of it being pre-booked and paid. Other guests who arrived after us, (Koreans) were immediately escorted to there rooms, while we were in the lobby. While we were there 3 more guests of other nationalities went past by us. It was only when I complained that they allowed us to go to our room! That was almost 30 minutes after. 

I Was told that it's alright not to leave a security deposit and just pay for whatever services we need. Okay. 

During the night, my mom arrived and was in reception, I told the operator over the phone that I need to take a shower and will pay right after. She said okay. I thought she's sending my mom to our room. But no she didn't. I finished showering, and waited for 20 more minutes. Then i went downstairs. She didn't send my mom upstairs because I need to pay additional 2000php because i didn't leave any deposit. It's not like we can escape and leave it unpaid! We paid for an overnight stay! And while we were there a family of another nationality came and was told that they can pay later since they were staying over night. So were we! 

Double standards.

851582857,We went here to enjoy a family welcome home trip. Haven't been home since covid hit and decided to come here to celebrate coming home.  First off the entrance is stunning just beautiful. They follow check ins very closely so if your trying to check in early be prepared to pay a 1500 peso fee. Sadly that's just the start of the upsells. Get to the room and a beautiful room and the free waters and coffee is great. Sadly our room wasn't fully cleaned and found a previous guests dirty towel behind the seat pillows on the couch. Had to wait for almost an hour for housekeeping to get.  Went to get the breakfast next am and that was a let down. If you going with any kids over 13 be prepared to pay. They only allow 2 adults and one kid under 13. Any children over 13 is a adult and you have to pay. The food was great not so much the upsell. The water park is ok but once again children get screwed out of it. The slides cannot be used by anyone under the age of 18. So that removes alot of the fun for them. Sadly only the pool is covered in your room fees. Porororo park is a separate fee to use. Any of the activities such as mini golf walking chess and the pedal bikes are all also fees.

843617799,"I am a big fan of this hotel resort (back when it was called Imperial Palace) until our last stay which was just this June 2022. To be honest the only selling point of this Hotel Resort is, of course, the Waterpark. It's only good for families with kids who will surely enjoy the swimming pools and slides. These are what I notice from our recent stay:

1. The lobby and check-in area looks old. It's high time that they elevate it.

2. Abalone, their buffet restaurant, still looks old and the same from the past years we have visited it. Breakfast buffet spread were all the same each day. Mactan Shangri-la is way better with their buffet options.

3. Our room is old. We opt for 2 bedroom suite since we are 4 adults. It was a long walk from the main lobby as it it in the farthest bldg in the property (ocean view) The TV was like from the 2000s and the bath tub has alot of dirt from its hardware material. I was looking forward to have a hot tub but didnt bother to use it anymore. Fridge looks old, dining table is old, every furniture is old. What we only liked here is the view but of course it comes with a price.

4. Dont waste your time in the beach area. Until now its not as sophisticated as Movenpick and Shangri-la. Lots of big stones and the rightmost side of the area is still undeveloped.

To the property owner, do not settle for being branded only as a ""Waterpark"" its now high time that you keep up with technology and change slowly everything inside your property such as furnitures and fixtures. Guests can have best of both worlds with old stylish with a hint of modernism.

Will we ever go back? not anymore. I just find this hotel tired. Will look forward to other beach resorts with modern ambiance (maybe Dusit). If Movenpick wasnt destroyed by the typhoon, it would be our first option to be honest, Jpark please keep up!",3,2022-06-19

I was able to get the 21 day advance purchase rate for a two bedroom suite. I didn‚Äôt know that the room that will be given to me was an old and un-refurbished room. It didn‚Äôt even have bidets in either of the bathrooms. Shouldn‚Äôt bidets be basic nowadays? No microwave in the room too.

My brother in Law, who also booked the same room category for the same exact rate got a newer room with bidets and a microwave.

My kids loved the Pororo suite room. One tile by the shower area was loose already and the water drain in the shower went down very slowly. At the foot of the beds in the room, there are wooden feet of the characters of the specific bed. It‚Äôs an accident waiting to happen. You should put foam or thick padding on those wooden feet to protect kids from getting hurt. Some of the balls in the ball pit were cracked open or literally sliced in half already. I had to remove all of them to avoid my kids from getting scratched from the broken balls.

Most of the staff were well mannered and pleasant, however most of them also assumed you know how to speak bisaya. As a property claiming to be 5 stars, shouldn‚Äôt English be your primary language there?

5 stars right? FOOD should have been great!!! It is far from great! The only good food we had in the property was from the Japanese resto in the premises called Nonki. And it‚Äôs a third party resto.

Property is beautiful and really a dream destination for kids. But it is very far from being a 5 Star property.

You guys need to hire a new F&B Director and Executive Chef. Food quality is of a 2-3 star hotel. Buffet area food was cold and sloppy.

The cons: Wanna play any of the ""entertainment"" offering they sale? PAY. You arrive couple hours before check-in and the room is available? PAY to get before 2pm. Wanna transport from-to Airport included after paying +u$250/night? PAY.

I really had the feeling of a very much profitability oriented hotel than customer oriented hotel. ONLY free entertainment offer was Darts, which were broken. I had to pay u$2 for 30min of a Ping Pong Table. 

I expect much more from such a pricey and supposedly 5* Hotel.

I spent 3 days in Moalboal after Jpark, on a u$80/night room and I had Pool, Foosball table, PingPong, BoardGames, and more, all included in the hotel rate.",2,2022-04-17
834225751,"This is the best place to stay with family with kids!
Very fast and good service. Water park was really clean. The kids enjoyed staying here. Rooms and food was good. I will highly recommend this place! The only thing that needs an upgrade is the beach.",5,2022-04-11
833996158,"The resort boasts that it is a 5 star resort but it doesn't feel like it to me.

Given there are a few positive things we can highlight.

1. The resort is huge, it is very suitable to families with kids who want to go on vacation. Their water park is definitely the highlight of the resort.
2. Staff were approachable and courteous.
3. Guests have lots of activities they can try.

Now on to the not so great things that the resort can improve on.

1. The lobby of the resort has a chaotic feel to it, given that it was a weekend and still in the middle of a pandemic. As a guest my family and I felt lost during the check.in process and no one had helped us with our baggages. We had to meander in the hotel ourselves.
2. Check-in process takes a long time.
3. Rooms are outdated, not that spacious and everything you request from a bucket full of ice to a bottle of water is charged.
4. My family reserved 4 rooms altogether, with an extra bed in each room and never in my life saw an extra bed at a 5 star resort setup from the floor. It was just a literal mattress, laid flat on the floor no folding bed at that! The blanket was very thin which made it more disappointing. 
5. The amenities weren't that great either, the public restroom near the main pool was disgusting. It smelled awful and looked like it wasn't maintained well. It felt like we were at a low class pool resort.
6. The staff did their best ig, but the guest services hotline is no longer available at 9pm.
7. Breakfast service was good in a mediocre kind of way, not much variety of choice given that it was a weekend. 
8. Definitely an experience we wont be repeating, if you're a family who likes to chill then there are better resorts in the area who give better service and amenities.

833897845,"What I love best about Jpark is its excellent service. The staff is friendly, the ambience is family-friendly, the room is cozy, and the amenities are superb. This can also be a go-to place for people who wants to work, chill, and play at the same time.",5,2022-04-09
833766769,"We stayed in a Pororo themed room, the colors and artwork in this room and hall leading to the room were absolutely amazing...sets the positive mood immediately upon arrival.

The staff are friendly and attentive to your every need.

The slides at their waterpark are safe and enjoyable for both kids and adults...

The drinks are professional and mixed perfectly...

While the Pororo Park may be targeted for kids eight and under...parents and kids of any age will enjoy the 5D adventures...

We are especially grateful for the complementary stuff toy that was sitting on the kids beds upon arrival ...my kids took the stuuf toy to the states with them!",5,2022-04-07

832494241,"It's our first time to be at JPark but it was a superb experience. The place is beautiful, clean and pool is very friendly for all types of ages. There is great selection of food and tastes so yummyüòç. It's a great place to relax and unwind. The staff also are friendly and accommodating. We are looking forward for our next visit cause an overnight stay is not enough to enjoy and experience JPark.",5,2022-03-27
831294740,"I would say that although it is a 5-star hotel, their Cebu Suite didn't really have ""the vibe"" upon entering the living room. Also, and most importantly, they have a broken POS that they already knew about because it happened so many times but didn't do anything about it. I don't know if it's their internet or their device but it was so annoying on our end especially that we had to personally go to our bank to have it resolved and it stretched on for days. So just a tip, don't pay with debit card bc it's really hassle AF! The place is really great for kids though, not so much for adults. AND GREAT BREAKFAST BUFFET!!!! Actually the best thing about the place.",3,2022-03-15
830801623,"My daughters always prefer a staycation over a party for their birthday. We‚Äôve been to many other resorts but they always prefer to go back to JPark!

It‚Äôs their happy place, very safe for children. They get to run around the whole place and swim from one pool to the other, try all the slides to their heart‚Äôs contents while mama and papa chills by the beach.

The staff are very friendly and accomodating, and there are many other activities that can be enjoyed by all members of the family.

Every year for the past 8-9 years, we‚Äôve always visited and stayed at JPark ( then Imperial Palace) and we‚Äôve never had a bad experience.

The best resort for the whole family! ‚ò∫Ô∏è",5,2022-03-11
829284319,"Although this resort is nice with a water park and direct access to the beach, that's about all the positives at the moment. The service is absolutely appaling. Understand that most hotels here in the Philippines are still recovering from covid and the typhoon but you can tell this resort is trying to maximise the occupancy even though they cannot handle the load. 1.5 hours to check in, with many people in the lobby not covid safe at all, then the nightmare gets worse at breakfast time, doesn't matter what time you go, still need to wait over 1 hour surrounded by many other guests, again not covid safe. My personal experience is I travelled from Australia and brought my family here, accommodated 20 adults and 4 kids, if I had of known their business model is to recoup funds on a long weekend I would have saved my money and stayed elsewhere. We would have loved the option to get a cheaper room rate without breakfast. Based on my experience, I would not recommend staying here, especially with a large group of people. Definitely not 4.5/5 star resort.",2,2022-02-25
828027011,"Good I like it, too bad tho that half of the water park is closed coz of the storm but still, it's pretty cool in here. They maintenance r really doin a great job on making the park look good. We got here yesterday and so far so good :))",5,2022-02-14
