957328485,"I hate to say but our recent stay was quite disappointing. We have been choosing this hotel for the past five years, consistently booking the same one-bedroom executive suite at approximately $180 per night. At this rate, we expect excellent service. Unfortunately, my fianc√© and I were very dissatisfied this time.
Compared to our previous stays, numerous aspects have declined, including the breakfast experience. While I understand the increase in guests, it is disheartening that they no longer serve water or coffee at the table. Instead, we had to walk to the refreshment station for a single glass of water. There were no placemats, and it was challenging to find staff for assistance. Such basic courtesies are typically upheld even by smaller hotels. After that, we avoided the breakfast buffet for the remainder of our stay, opting to order from our room instead, which felt both sad and wasteful.
Also, the lounge's alcohol selection was subpar, much to my fianc√©'s displeasure, and the food choices were minimal and repetitive.

We stayed for four nights and aimed to salvage the rest of our trip. Fortunately, the food was excellent, especially the Indian cuisine. Kudos to the chef for the authentic taste! The roof deck bar was a highlight, with attentive and entertaining staff, particularly Rica and Jennecil. Maira, Kent, and Aris were also very accommodating to my friends. Despite the overall disappointment, their hospitality made our time enjoyable.
Special thanks to Janry, Marden, and Don from the lounge for ensuring we received the service we needed. Their efforts were the main reason our stay was tolerable. But after this experience, we're not sure if we'll come back. It's sad, given our years of loyalty, but we hope things improve in the future.",3,2024-06-30

957299530,"We recently stayed at the hotel from June 28-29 and had a fantastic experience overall. Cess Tampus was exceptionally accommodating, assisting with our special request for connecting rooms since we had our grandma with us. She ensured our rooms were comfortable, making our stay very pleasant.

However, we encountered a minor issue at the Pool Bar. When we asked for the bill, the waiter mistakenly charged our bank card without letting us check the receipt first. It turned out we paid for another table's order, nearly doubling our amount. Thankfully, they voided the charge after we pointed out the mistake, but it should not have happened in the first place. The staff should ensure the correct bill is presented and confirmed before charging.

Despite this, the overall experience was wonderful. The food was delicious, and we enjoyed a sumptuous dinner and breakfast at Cafe Bai. We look forward to returning in the future.",4,2024-06-29

The restaurant is very clean and food was aleast available in the buffet containers;  the variety of food is ‚Äòchef‚Äôs kiss‚Äô. Our experience  was made even better by the staff, namely Apple Gay and Roxanne. Apple always checked on us and knew what we wanted before we asked. They always cleaned out empty plates on our table so we would have room for more food. Apple provided my mom with different recommendations so my mom didn‚Äôt have to walk to the line (she is 90 years old). They both treated my mom with care, respect and compassion. This is the reason why we will be back and will tell all of our friends and family to stay at the Bai Hotel Cebu. Thank you to Marcel and Jenn who always stops and chats with us and makes sure my mom is getting all the food she wants. 
Now off to enjoy the fantastic pool. Don‚Äôt miss experiencing the Bai Hotel Cebu. It will give you hope that there are people who care. All we want is for my mom to enjoy and the staff at Bai Cebu has succeeded.

949955287,"I‚Äôve been traveling around the world for well over 50 years. Whether it be North America, South America, Asia, Australia, or Europe I have never found a more welcoming hotel than the bai Hotel in Cebu. The accommodations were incredible. Where do I start?  The room/bed was so comfortable with luxurious sheets and pillows, the A/C was top notch and easily controllable, the TV was huge and crystal clear, the complimentary water restocked everyday, turn down bedding with snacks, and the most wonderful rain shower ever. The rooftop pool was a delight and the bar with food service is incredibly delicious. The prices for everything were more than fair and for a New Yorker like myself cheap. I must stop and take a moment to comment on the breakfast buffet which whenever possible I opt for. If you do stay here I highly recommended you include this when you book. I once stayed at a hotel in Iceland which I thought was a phenomenal buffet breakfast until I came to the bai. My words cannot do it justice so you can take my word for it (or not) but I challenge you to find one better. I know you won‚Äôt. If I have the opportunity I‚Äôll post some pics of the breakfast here. But the over all best part of our six night stay were the staff. Everyone from the checkin desk to checking out was the most helpful people I ever came across. Their service was fast and courteous. Everyone couldn‚Äôt have been better. I could go on and on about the fantastic stay we had at the bai but if you‚Äôve read this far you get the idea. If you plan a stay in this fantastic city I highly recommend you book it here and I will guarantee you the best hotel experience you ever had.",5,2024-05-07

947553416,"Bai Hotel was nice, and I would definitely stay there again. I chose it as it is close to the airport for a late arrival and early departure a few days later. The taxi rides were both quick and under 200php. 
The room was clean (although a few hairs in the bathroom) and well-equipped. The bed was quite hard but the bedding was very comfortable, so I slept really well.  Toiletries were provided but in large containers.  Robes were available upon request and slippers were in the room.  I especially appreciated the loofa to scrub away the sun cream. Two water bottles were provided daily.
The Park Mall had a small grocery but otherwise was very underwhelming. However it was a very short taxi trip to Alaya Mall. 
The rooftop was nice for city views and a cocktail. I had a pizza at the restaurant after asking if I could take half away for the morning. They said yes, but then when it came to packing it up, were quite difficult. Then, I discovered the fridge in the room was not cold, something they should have told me at the start. This was the only negative but was disappointing as only bought the pizza to have half later.
The coffee shop was nice and had a delicious croissant. 
The staff were all so lovely and genuinely welcoming. The concierge were especially AMAZING! After my driver for a day trip pulled out last minute in the evening before, they spent time finding me a replacement for the same price. Thank you Andrei and John Fred!!!",5,2024-04-20

The breakfast charge is P1288 (US $33 ) per person which is expensive for the Philippines. I spend 6 out 12 months a year living in the Philippines. No other hotel has tried to charge me extra for breakfast booking. Booking. Com are very good and have paid for the extra breakfasts. The question is if I wasn't a foreigner I don't believe I would be charged extra.",2,2024-04-17

A few minutes later Roxanne came back with some ripe mangoes for my mother! 

Bai Cafe is a buffet restaurant, servers are not expected to get food for patrons. Roxanne went above and beyond her job to help a senior citizen have a more enjoyable meal. I will never forget the kindness she has shown my mother!

941773102,"I had heard good things about the bai Hotel in Cebu, but my own experience there certainly exceeded all expectations. The amenities were top-notch: the rooms were well-appointed and clean; the restaurants and bars had an extensive selection of cuisines and beverages; the rooftop bar with live music was fun; the infinity pool overlooking the Cebu skyline was probably the chillest in the city; and the breakfast buffet was one of the most extensive one would find in any hotel. But the best part of my bai experience was the staff. I believe hotel staff everywhere are trained to be helpful and polite, but the politeness, helpfulness and friendliness of the bai staff came across as a little more genuine and spontaneous than what I have experienced in other 5-star hotels. And while every member of the staff came across as super-helpful and courteous, my special thanks goes out to Jhona, who patiently answered all my queries about Filipino food at the breakfast spread, and Rodelyn, who made my check-out process a breeze.",5,2024-03-11

This visit we were exiting the elevator around 9pm and felt something drip from our bag, but before we could see what it was it slipped through the crack and dropped 15 floors. We called the front desk and they immediately reviewed surveillance and determined a pen had become dislodged and that was what we lost to the crack beteen the floor and elevator. Mystery solved and they actually retrieved the pen from the elevator pit. Our son attends CDU and Bai is so conveniently located that he can actually join us for lunch some days.

935447544,"During my five-night stay at the hotel, I encountered numerous issues that significantly detracted from the overall experience. The trouble began during check-in when the receptionist, Marjorie, claimed that none of my pre-noted requests for a Harbor View Room on a higher level could be accommodated due to apparent lack of availability. Despite my prior communication and assurance from a representative, Marjorie only fulfilled my request when I expressed frustration in front of other waiting guests.

The problems continued during check-out, where a pre-arranged late check-out was seemingly disregarded. Despite confirming a late departure and agreeing to associated charges, the housekeeping staff interrupted my rest at 11 am, insisting on a 12 pm check-out. To exacerbate matters, upon returning from lunch at 1 pm, I discovered that my room key cards had been deactivated, preventing access despite notifying the front desk of a planned 3 pm check-out.

These incidents collectively indicate a disorganized check-in/check-out process, poor communication within the staff, and an overall lack of coordination. Such shortcomings significantly marred my experience, raising concerns about the hotel's operational efficiency and customer service standards.",2,2024-01-24

Bai Hotel in Mandaue impressively offers a variety of buffet styles that are completely free of lard and pork. With a family that strictly adheres to an Islamic diet, I have longed to bring them to Cebu. However, most restaurants and establishments primarily feature menus with pork content, which has been a setback for me.

The beds so comfortable, roof top pool facilities and view really pleasant . But the staff and buffet breakfast are the stand out performers.
All the managers made themselfs known to me . On this trip I have cancelled further Cebu hotel stays so I can go back to the bai in 2 days and again in 2 weeks .
I would always stay in the bai in the future .

The staffs were all wonderful, kind and very accommodating. The breakfast buffet was great as well. The reason why I only gave 3 stars was because the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. 

The Bed - so hard that it gave me body ache upon getting up the following day. I had to get up early cause I couldn‚Äôt stayed any much longer in bed. It was so hard that it‚Äôll give you so much sore. Not relaxing at all. 

Pillows - it was not as soft as usual pillows you see in a high end hotels. The pillows were flat and plastic feel. There is no comfort touch that will make you wanna go to bed and relax.",3,2024-01-11

I could say that in the last several years, we have stayed in 1-3 week stints at the Marriott Ayala, Quest, Blu, and most recently 2 nights at the Fili-NuStar. Make no mistake, the Radisson facility is nice and the Fili-Nustar is grand and the best rooms. 
Bai hotel is pretty straightforward hotel with decent rooms. Although it doesn‚Äôt have the fancy amenities the bigger hotels have, it makes it up with its staff.

931396864,"A last minute decision to spend a couple of nights in Cebu City found us adding an extra night due to the comfort of staying at Bai.
The first night we were meant to go out for dinner but after a tour of the buffet we couldn‚Äôt help but stay and indulge in the varied cuisine. Personally I loved the sushi and sashimi, a cheese platter and tasted bits from all the different stations. We loved the fresh fruit and vegetables too and the desserts were a hit with the kids! My husband liked the roast and vegetables. 
We went again the second night because it was so easy and were hosted by Princess who was so attentive all while attending to her other duties. We appreciate the effort to get our young daughter the scrambled eggs she was asking for, even though it wasn‚Äôt on the dinner buffet menu! Salamat po!
We‚Äôve found the staff in the hotel so friendly and engaging. The concierge was very helpful in booking a tour for my mother in law. 
The most annoying this was our room access cards repeatedly not working and having to go to reception to fix them.

931254281,"Being a hotelier for the last 10 years driving guest experience, i do have an understanding of how a hotel operates. I just checked in with Nina, friendly yet she lacked many aspects of what Hoteliers should do but for some reason I understand, I booked through Agoda, a deluxe room for two with a request for a large bed. Upon arrival I was told there was no request, and yet when I told her I requested for a large bed, she proceeded and said - it's subject to availability. Unfortunately, hotels gives the lowest category to their guests booked thru OTAs. But on many occasions, hotels do find ways. 

Now, here's what Nina failed to do 1/Apologize that I am unhappy with room choice I am getting because accordingly that's what's available 2/Offer alternatives such as combine the twin bed! It takes 5minutes for a room attendant to do this change 3/offer a paid upgrade for a higher room category 4/inform me of the hotel facilities, she didn't even mention where breakfast is but has reminded me that since I have deposit everything will be billed to the roon 5/to make matters worst, she ended my check in wishing me to ""enjoy your stay"" which I clearly won't.

I would have settled for this room if I felt cared for, some level of empathy or some lip service that if a room with large bed will be available she would inform me so a room move could be made, also offer me some options etc. So much for expecting a hotel in the heart of cebu to deliver. Or maybe, I should have lowered my expectations or better just stayed elsewhere.

930687285,"At first, we planned to stay at Bai Hotel only for 2 nights but decided to extend our stay longer because of the kind and nice people working at the Hotel. Especially, we wanted to appreciate and mention some people. First, Chloe, a receptionist at the, kindly helped us to plan our tour to Oslob and extending a night in the same room. Rica Mae, a waitress at the rooftop bar, provided the best recommendation on food and drinks and kept us in being taken care of. Queen, a receptionist on 21st floor, always welcomed us with a beautiful smile even when we bothered her with small talks and jokes. Franz and Cedric, on the first floor, always helped us to get a taxi and took care of our stuffs so we do not lose anything. Jasmine, a cleaner on the 15th floor, always kindly talked and helped us to clean the room perfectly. Jake always did good job with delivery food to our room. Because of the people working at Bai Hotel, we strongly recommend everyone to stay at this hotel when you come to Cebu. Nice room, beautiful view, good food and drinks will make your life happy. We literally just stayed at hotel without doing any activities until the last day, but we are still so happy. We are definitely staying again next year to say Hi to the people.

The rooms was also very clean and everyone was really nice and like to help and give you informations about the city and the island. ",5,2023-12-21
930526697,"Receptionists at check in and check out were friendly, talkative, and welcoming. The room is spacious, clean, with a great view. Everything was going quite smoothly until we went for breakfast. We called ahead the night before to inquire about protocols for bringing guests. We were informed about the charges. When we asked about the possibility of reserving a table, we were told tables are on a first come first served basis. When we arrived to the buffet, we picked a free table with no ""occupied"" sign on it for our party. The hostess insisted the table is occupied even though there were no signs on it that say it is. We kept asking where are the guests that are seated at the table, instead of answering us the hostess decided to put the ""occupied"" sign on the table right in front of us. To avoid further arguments, we found 2 separate tables nearby and asked if they could be put together so we have one large table. About 4 staff members stared at each other instead or assisting us, leaving us no choice but to move the tables and add chairs ourselves. This whole encounter made us and our guests feel unwelcome and the way the staff handled the situation was disappointing. 
Once we got the tables together, we went to the buffet, where the cherry on top of this disastrous experience was found. At the tea selection and coffee station, there was a cockroach roaming around freely. I fled the premise and went back to my table, no food in hand. I found another cockroach roaming on the floor around our table. I lost my appetite wondering about the cleanliness of the food and whether or not the kitchen is infested with more cockroaches. When we left the premise, I checked the table we originally wanted, only to find that it remained empty, with the solitary occupied sign on it. This was very disappointing, if tables are indeed first come first served, then why was this table reserved the whole time for guests that never showed up?

Overall, the diversity of the food at the buffet was met by equally diverse disappointments of unprofessionalism and lack of proper sanitation. ",2,2023-12-21
930524970,"Not a bad experience for a first time! I've tried different accommodations this year, but none have felt as welcoming as Bai's. My work friends and I spent a night in the the pool bar.

930494516,"Overall, I must say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and accommodating. They were always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests I had during my stay.

However, I must express my disappointment regarding a couple of issues I encountered. Firstly, there was a persistent moldy smell in the floor hallway, which was quite unpleasant. It made me feel uncomfortable and concerned about the general cleanliness of the hotel.

Additionally, the air conditioning in my room was extremely loud, making it difficult to have a peaceful and relaxing night's sleep. The constant noise was quite bothersome and affected my overall experience at the hotel.

On a more positive note, I found the breakfast buffet to be quite enjoyable. There was a good selection of food available, and I appreciated the variety of options to choose from. It was a pleasant start to the day.

Unfortunately, my stay took a turn for the worse when I woke up with insect bites that resembled bed bug bites. Naturally, I was alarmed and immediately went to the management to request a thorough checking of my room. I expressed my concern about the possibility of my belongings getting infested if there were indeed bed bugs present. The management conducted an inspection, but they confirmed that they couldn't find any evidence of bed bugs.

While I am relieved that there were no bed bugs, I must admit that I am quite upset about the itchy bites I experienced. It has affected my overall satisfaction with my stay at Bai Hotel and left me feeling saddened by the whole ordeal.

I hope this feedback can be taken constructively and used to improve the overall experience for future guests. I genuinely believe that with some attention to these issues, Bai Hotel has the potential to provide an even better stay for its guests.",1,2023-12-21

While I really appreciate and impressed on every hotel that includes practices to save the environment, I think BAI went overboard by providing only bath towels in the room and one has to call housekeeping for hand and face towels.  I think Bai should already provide the hand and face towels outright.  Those are the basics.

Layout-wise, I‚Äôm not really sure if I liked the layout the restaurant - kitchen, areas where the food are (too cramped), but I‚Äôm sure it was well thought of by the planners.
The server/waiters were courteous - special mention to those who assisted us, Angeles (who took our photo), Chesca (who sat us down and overall assistance provider) and Arjay.",5,2023-11-04

923967790,"We had an absolutely amazing experience at this hotel and restaurant! The service provided by Antone and the team lead Ariel was exceptional. Antone was incredibly attentive to our needs, making sure every detail was perfect. Ariel went above and beyond by offering us free cocktails and access to the exclusive pool area, where I was able to propose to my girl during our second anniversary celebration. The food at the restaurant was excellent, with a wide variety of delicious options to choose from.

Aside from the outstanding service and delicious food, the hotel offered a room w/ a breathtaking view that added to the overall charm of the place, shoutout to Venus for making this happen.

Our family had the pleasure of being served by Archie at the pool bar on the 21st floor during our recent stay at bai Hotel Cebu.

923269447,"This was our second stay. On the 1st stay there was a minor emergency and the Assistant Manager Roy Saloman was able to control the situation and get me safely and get me somewhere I could recover quietly. On this trip not only did he remember me but also remembered my situation. He made sure the Head Manager Maricel knew of my situation and she made sure a table was reserved for me that I was comfortable with and could enjoy my breakfast.
 On the second night we went to the ""Marble and Grain"" the steakhouse, and my girlfriends birthday. Roy was there and I can only assume he let the staff know about us. The Head chef came out and spoke with us, talked about our steaks and sauces, laughed and joked with us as they all did. Eme and Geo did an absolutely fantastic job of making our dinner one my girlfriend won't forget anytime soon. I would say the prices are on a par or a little lower than normal hotel restaurants. You defiantly get what you pay for. Not once have I felt cheated or taken advantage of.
The next night we went to ""Ume"" the Japanese restaurant. If you don't know anything about Japanese food like we didn't, don't be intimidated. Our server Nelmore did an excellent job of explaining the choices. Another great meal was had. 
The hotel its self is wonderful, clean and modern. The staff is impeccable, knowledgeable friendly and always with a good morning/afternoon/evening. Without a doubt this is my new home in Cebu. I'm looking forward to our next stay.",5,2023-10-28

As you can see from the video, staff don‚Äôt seem to be bothered that kids are running around the bar/ lounge area screaming and running under tables for the last hour. I‚Äôve complained to front desk and they done nothing to calm the situation down.

The bedrooms are nice but the beds are rock hard, sleeping here with a injury has been a difficulty.

5 star hotel which wasn‚Äôt cheap and very disappointing. Step up your game staff!

Update & downgrade ‚ùå This place is an absolute shambles. Yes, the staff are all so sweet and nice but there is just no authority here. We ended up leaving the lounge at 8pm due to 2+ hours of kids yelling and we ended up eating dinner in our room. The manager came to our room as requested and what was done? NOTHING.

However, we had a flight to catch at 3pm so went into Cebu City to explore early in the morning. After returning at 11.30am and asking can we use the pool for 1 hour before we go to the airport we were told because we were already checked out on the system we would have to pay 600php per person to use it. I think this is a bit of a joke considering we had stayed for several nights and paid a considerable amount of money. Any hotel I've stayed in in the past has been happy to let you use the pool area the day of check in/check out. 

Really left a sour taste, would not stay here again. ",3,2023-10-21

921656841,"I gave Bai Hotel Cebu 3 stars due to the disappointing room conditions during my recent stay, despite the friendly staff. The rooms need improvement. The water pressure was very low, making showers difficult. The towels felt like sandpaper on my skin, not soft and plush as expected at a hotel. The air conditioner struggled to keep the room cool in the tropical heat. With only one outlet in the entire room, there was nowhere to plug in devices near the beds, just some exposed wires sticking out of holes in the walls. For a hotel that is only around 5 years old, these infrastructure issues were surprising. There was also mildew building up in the shower area. The staff were very nice and apologetic about the issues, but the hotel rooms themselves need maintenance and renovation. With some improvements to the rooms, Bai Hotel Cebu would be worthy of a higher rating. I hope they can upgrade the amenities to match their excellent service. But for now, the disappointing room conditions bring this hotel down to 3 stars.",3,2023-10-17

Very accommodating from phone and face to face interactions - very much impressed and grateful. 
After a long commute, the porters and graveyard attendees were highly welcoming and authentically helpful. Just a couple of hours in and everyone‚Äôs been so lovely at every department from their cafe to their pool bar - spectacular views btw, unbelievable and proud to see my hometown flourishing. 

Been recommended by mother dearest and it‚Äôs safe to say Bai sticks to its roots with it being family friendly and all round inclusive from their food variety and heartwarming professionalism to each guest they come across. Modern amenities adaptable to both locals and foreigners is great and I highly recommend. Also just across Parkmall so that‚Äôs a plus. 

Mum and I both having hospitality background have a special eye for what we know is good service, and no there are no words to express how much they go beyond that. Our room was clean and comfortable and the attention to detail and fast service is rare to come by so if quality service is what you‚Äôre looking for and inevitably more, Bai Hotel doesn‚Äôt disappoint as they tick every box. 

Extending my special gratitude and appreciation to Ray‚Äôs compassion at midnight over the phone who helped get my booking all in order before arrival. Gian‚Äôs warm and kind welcome upon check in were outstanding, even went to go out of his way to check how everything was in the room once we‚Äôve settled was unexpected but it was another cherry on top. The porter‚Äôs which I didn‚Äôt get their names should never be left unappreciated as their strong and lively aid is what makes the first impression worth while - purely stunning. Archie‚Äôs politeness and considerate source of info in the cafe made it concrete that it was good to be back home again. Thanks to Khino‚Äôs lovely assistance at the front desk for attending a request I had so quickly even though it wasn‚Äôt urgent whatsoever - grand top to bottom and all round.

908189533,"The best thing about using Bai Hotel as a venue for official functions is the Banquet Service and Facilities, and Cafe Bai Service and Food. The front office and the rooms are a different story. They‚Äôll need to improve the tangibles and the service in order to merit thumbs up. 
The Banquet Facilities are good. Spacious and cool. Well set-up. With great technical support from engineering (special mention Marlon - he is technically competent, pleasant, prompt). Banquet Service is excellent. The service team is punctual, courteous, pleasant, personable and responsive. Special mention must be made of Quin, Edmar and Clark. They anticipate what you need, they are fast. They give Bai a very good name. They MUST be recognized and commended internally!
Cafe Bai food is hands down the BEST! The quality is great! The variety is great! And most of all, the F&B staff do their job Very Well! Maricel Newman leads them very well! She is experienced and sets a very good example. The rest of her team is equally as good! Rowel, Rachel, Lenie - they all have smiling welcome expressions consistently, they serve very well. Like the banquet staff, they are swift, responsive and they anticipate and think of what you need even before you ask. They MUST be recognized and commended internally as well!
The front office and the rooms division - they have a lot of work to do to catch up. The front office (next to the guards and bellman) is the first encounter you have with the hotel. And unfortunately, they‚Äôre not consistently good. Sometimes you meet someone who‚Äôs competent and who knows his/her job, most of the time you are handled by personnel who give the vibe of being unsure. They‚Äôre not sharp nor fast. You‚Äôll need to wait your turn most of the time. Their turnaround time could be faster. As for the rooms? Very inconsistent. You get rooms that are ok. They give you welcome pastries or drinks, you are welcomed with your name on the screen and in cards addressed to you personally, you have complete amenities and everything works. But at other times (this last trip was one for the books!), you get a really bad experience: no more welcome pastries (they call the next day and say sorry they forgot) AND the TV doesn‚Äôt work (housekeeping looks at it, is helpless, so calls IT and IT fixes it - supposedly! - and assures you it‚Äôs ok, and then it bogs down again). They transfer you to another room (because you repeatedly complain) - but in that next room, you face a TV that works tbf (but it uses ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù and hieroglyphics for you to understand how it works - it‚Äôs customer unfriendly! - they acknowledge and explain that they upgraded the TV but still use the old remote so it‚Äôs hard to use). The new room you‚Äôre transferred to does not have hot water (faucet on the sink) and is dirty (the housekeeping did not see the dirt (a used plastic they must have overlooked below the mirror near the sink). The door jamb is also stuck all the time. The pillows are not as soft. Sigh. The duty manager comes to you and apologizes profusely and does what he can to pacify you. The question is: why put yourself in a position where an apology is needed? If the front office and rooms division can look into their tangibles and can do their job as well as F&B does, they‚Äôll definitely merit two thumbs up and more.",3,2023-08-06

I had a lot of experiences at this hotel. When I first arrived, I was impressed by the tight security procedures when my taxi was stopped, Also, my luggage went through an X-ray machine. The concierge are very welcoming and the ladies with teal long gown assisted me going to check-in counter and entertained my son.
I had no reservation, Venus happily assisted me.

My first room was on the lower floor with no view, and you could hear families walking by. After few minutes someone from the customer service called to check on me, told her my concerns: I have senior citizen mother coming late evening and the room is small plus no view at all, Venus immediately responded and assisted me for room transfer. I was upgraded to the top floor, which was the suite, and a very comfy-accessible room for my mom because its near lift and I got an ocean-view room. The room was very quiet, and enjoyed watching the sunset.

The buffet restaurant had a fantastic breakfast. We used the spa for massages which were top-notch. Once you get to this hotel, there is no need to go anywhere for the rest of your vacation or business trip.

Lastly, would like to give a tap on the back of all your staff esp. the hotel manager for a job well-done! Everything is well managed and organised. We can really see they trained and choose their staff well. Keep up your outstanding and phenomenal customer service ever.

Please, I will definitely come back.",5,2023-07-06

We had an issue with our sink but it was immediately handled by Mr. Barriga from housekeeping. Mr. Barriga and his housekeeping team also made sure that we had everything we needed during our stay. 

The King size bed has great fit/quality for foreigners or taller people. 

The breakfast buffet has a lot of choices and always fully stocked and not to mentioned, tasty. 

We tried the Marble and Grains restaurant, the servers were very attentive but a few issues overall. 1. The cheese and meat boards took over 30 mins and was served later after we had our soup (it was disappointing) the rest of the meal was great. 
It's a nice restaurant but some guests are so rude to have their phone blasting on loud speaker while dining not everyone wants to hear somebody else's conversation. 

Also visited the Twilight bar, our server Almar was great. We had some questions about the place and the surrounding properties and he answer it all politely more like we are talking to a friend.

We met the Duty Managers LEE SANDER and ELLEN. They were so pleasant and amazing in giving us  some new  information about the hotel, since it had been a long time since I last visited. They  are living  proofs of superb customer service!

We ended up  having an enjoyable night at Twilight Roof Deck bar and lounge, we were very-well assisted by Margie.

We definitely will come back again and again, for food, for fun, vacation or  staycation. We love Bai!

They provide Php 20 less on the bill of your bill on your favorite drinks from their wallstreet coffee bar and its staff are required to have their own reusable tumbler as their official water container.

My hubby lost his phone in the hotel. They searched the room and restaurant but it was not found. We contacted them through booking.com messaging that it may have fallen in the hallway as my daughter and hubby were chasing each other after breakfast. They did a search and found it. Through an App in the iPad, my hubby indicated that the device is lost and to contact a number if found. This allowed them to contact me and we returned to the hotel after flight check in to retrieve the phone!

Super thankful to the staff for assisting!! The Costumer Manager did not even accept our small token of appreciation.

The choices for Filipino breakfast and American breakfast had it all covered, but the Japanese, Korean, and Cantonese is kind of a guessing game based on pop culture to be exact. Overall, the services of Allica and Qring at the buffet is exceptional.

- concierge is superb and attentive -- one of them even remembered the taxi company we used the first 2 days even with the weekend guest influx that they had - mind blowing in a great way!
- must hangout at the pool bar --- I enjoyed the view and the food/drink service provided
- one of the best halo-halo (especially the leche flan and ube) I've tasted since I've been in the country for almost 2 weeks.
- bed was a little too firm but the pillows were comfortable that suprisingly I didn't have any neck/back aches after waking up.

Cons:
- the dressed up lady greeters are more attentive and bubbly IF you are a guy and looks more foreigner... ü§£
- no welcome drink or complimentary water or coffee in the lobby even if you're in a long wait for check-in.
- there's a baby cockroach in my room ü§Æ my 1st night
- unpleasant view in the immediate surroundings of the hotel on 2 sides (we got 2 rooms across each other) but can get a view of the mountain on one and a bit of the water on the other.
- although they have full bathroom amenities (dental kit, shower cap, shaving, sanitary bag), they do not provide shampoo, conditioner, and lotion
- hair dryer is a so-so.... and I have to untangle the cord myself üòî
- they also do not provide hand towels and face towels on their deluxe rooms--- seriously?ü§Ø --- but they did provide both when I asked for it.

The Japanese restaurant, Ume is nothing to write home about either.  They claim that they have a Japanese chef on board but nothing about the food tastes authentic.  The rice was not even Japanese rice and the ramen was not savory.  This coming from a restaurant that charges PHP600 on average per dish.  The beds are hard.  Someone comes to knock at your door early in the morning to confirm if you are indeed checking out.  They could have just slipped a letter under the door or better just wait for their guests to come down or inform them of any changes in the booking plan.  They charge PhP50 per bucket of ice requested for your room, something that bigger and better hotels don't do.

Thinking of it like an ordinary staycation, the whole stay totally went off board! And the experience is really worth going back. Mr. Mardin, Mr. Don and Mr. Janray made my whole executive lounge experience  akin to a VIP guests! Something the everyone need to try!

Had one of the best steaks of my life at Marble and Grain Steakhouse (250g porterhouse) with the most wonderful staff. Everyone‚Äôs so nice! 

Fully recommend, especially for Americans as this hotel has all the amenities you‚Äôd find in a hotel in the states, plus more. Complimentary shaving, dental, and hygiene kits in the bathrooms make my life easy. I asked for sheets for the sofa bed and they came and made the bed for me complimentarily! 

I‚Äôve also visited their infinity pools and bar at the roof. I had a ‚Äúsex on the beach‚Äù and a ‚Äúclover club‚Äù and oh my god, the mixologist is magic. So good I got a little drunk on accident. Their pool bathrooms even have complimentary body wash and shampoo! That with the robes they provide, it‚Äôs a recipe for relaxation.

The only ‚Äú‚Äúdownside‚Äù‚Äù I‚Äôve seen is the shower would sometimes go cold for a few seconds, but every hotel I‚Äôve stayed at in the Philippines has had the exact same issue, so I‚Äôm not upset at all. 

What really sealed my happiness for this hotel had to be the concierge who remembered us when we came back for our return overnight layover. His name tag said his name was Paul, I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs introduced himself to me but I have a poor memory, and he is just a delight. So easy to talk to and a joy to be around. What a guy!

882710608,"My husband and I attended a wedding here and we booked a suite room, which was also the kind of room we stayed in during the pandemic as this hotel was our ""quarantine hotel"" where we stayed separately for 7-10 days (we flew separately w different incoming flights from the US). The service then was as it was during our recent stay- we were so glad to be able to enjoy the big room together this time. 

The staff are all very friendly and I have to mention how one of them went out of his way to make sure I got to the airport on time despite the ridiculous traffic (the bridge to the airport was closed that morning due to an accident), who had my bags brought to the check-in counter while I had gone ahead sprinting to the counter. It was also my birthday and instead of being a very lonely one, they gave me a cake. 

Then, and during this recent visit,  the staff were very friendly and attentive. 

We missed the mad scramble for the breakfast buffet by going as late as we could (past 9am). 

Unfortunately we weren't able to check out their facilities. I had a ramen lunch at Ume and it was served as fast as I requested. 

Will definitely stay here again.",5,2023-03-19

From food to technical, to the proactive, friendly service, an accommodating ambiance of willingness, and a lot of proactive coordination, we appreciate the gesture of reassuring us that they got our backs.

Thanks Reymar, Quin, Conrado, Lyza, Chito, Edgar, Jason and the guys who made sure that the backdrop was set (I was not able to get their names but pls. let him/them be acknowledged here as well - 1 guy has a slim frame who assisted us around 3:45 PM for the backdrop)  and the rest of those who assisted us directly and indirectly, we appreciate every one of you.

VERY pleasant surprise. Hotel recently renovated and was outstanding value. I hate to
tell management who may be reading this how INEXPENSIVE this hotel was. 
I stayed two weeks. Ate at all the restaurants, the pool, the penthouse bar and lots of 
room service. I was so impressed with the Italian food that I personally thanked the chef.
They employ (very attractive IMHO) greeters who assist with getting you situated. Unique and welcome. Pool was v nice. I liked the bed and the v high quality bedding which they changed daily although not necessary for a solo traveller. I thought the morning buffet breakfast excellent but also had lunch and dinner buffet which are better values.

876501462,"We celebrated the birthday of my husband at Bai Cafe. My husband is free of charge since he's the celebrant as well as my 2 toddlers ages 5 and 2 yrs old meaning we only paid for 1.

The rooms were modern and spotless.
comfy bed and pillows.
aircon. fridge.
great amenities, robe, slippers, toothbrush, shampoo. 
we had a welcome dessert waiting in the room. 
all the food looks stunning and is delicious.
every member of staff is so friendly and polite they all speak perfect english even when I try and practice my bisaya.
the pool bar is stunning. 
the only issue is location it's just outside the main city and nothing much nearby so we used alot of taxis but there is park mall next door to buy any groceries. 
we had a perfect vacation visiting family in Cebu",5,2023-01-26
876293924,"Cons
- Rooms are full of mold. I am saying rooms because as soon as we entered to our room I could clearly smell mold. Asked to change it but they sent staff with spray air freshener. I explained that it wont change situation so they moved me to a new room which had a same issue. Smelled awfully moldy, made me sneeze and cough all the time. You can see wallpapers have yellowish spots, bathroom ceiling which indicates mold is under it and on tiles. Very bad for your health especially if you consider to stay more than a night 
- No spa. I asked if there is spa, staff guided that there is so I made a reservation. However apparently there is no spa, and therapist comes to room. Cancelled because did not want oily sheets and neck aching after having massage in pillow.
- Location. Nothing around, mall across the street is not worth even to look. No restaurants around
- View from room is terrible. Container yard.

Pro
- Close to airport. 20min ride 290peso
- Room itself looks neat, modern and clean (except hidden mold)
- Nice night view from pool on the roof
- Very welcoming and friendly staff
- Fast wifi available at all points of hotel",2,2023-01-25

With the recent shut down of Philippine airspace and all flights being cancelled or delayed, and our plane's arrival at 4 am (over 26 hours after our scheduled arrival), we were taken very good care of, offered a really late check out of 2 pm, and were given a good room with a nice view. There was also a buffet breakfast offered! Everyone was extremely pleasant, even the concierge that helped us get transportation to our next destination of Moalboal. My recommendation is to have a local phone number to be able to get in contact with the Hotel for any emergencies or issues, as email communications were slow, almost non existent.",4,2023-01-04

I gave it a shot but the cafe bai people called and wanted to go to my room to have the resto bill settled instead of being charged to thw room ... for whatever reason ... so so very inconsiderate specially noting that I already PAID the whole stay in advance (in the thousands) and they want to go to my room for me to settle a 700 peso billing ... bad bad service,1,2022-12-21

We were pleasantly surprised!
It's a hotel geared for the business market, but it is also accommodating for Families.
Hotel rooms were clean and maintained. 
Easy transfers to the port and airport were handy.
Breakfast was at a huge Buffet area. Great quality and selection. ",5,2022-12-20

871956918,"One night stay at a junior suite. Room was quite nice overall. The room had four distinct areas - a living area, small utility kitchen, the bedroom proper and the toilet. Interior design was contemporary and generally pleasing to the eye. The bathroom was probably my least favorite space because it‚Äôs tiny compared to the rest of the room. I would have gladly accepted a smaller utility kitchen for a larger bathroom. Everything in the room worked. I had two TVs, one in the living area, the other in the bedroom. Both were HD (at least), sufficiently large and up to date. The bed was king sized. The mattress was firm but not hard. There was little in the way of stationary or pens in the room though and I couldn‚Äôt get the WiFi to work. However, I didn‚Äôt call it in.

For a nice little touch, J received a welcome pastry from the hotel. The pastry was only okay.

The breakfast buffet looked good. However, because the space got so full and crowded so quickly, I sort of lost my appetite. I dislike eating in a zoo like atmosphere. Of the viands I tried, they were only okay. Had breakfast been more relaxed, maybe I would have enjoyed it more.

Location wise, the hotel is located  in a gentrifying area of Mandaue. There is a shopping area across the street but nothing much else. The decrepit convention center is also right across. The remainder of the area is composed of open lots.",3,2022-12-17

870904159,"I have stayed at the Bai Hotel in Mandaue a few times and it is always a good experience. Some positives are that the location is in walking distance to both Parkmall & City Times Square where there are restaurants and resto bars. The rooftop bar is a great experience, especially for the view and the attentive staff. However, on occasion the band or DJ are just very loud, which takes away from a pleasant dining experience. The Pool Bar was also worth a snack and drink and only one level down from the rooftop bar. 

This past overnight stay was made very pleasant mostly due to the staff, especially Chai at the front desk, Guia & Rechelle in the lobby, assisting with check-in and check-out and other guest needs, and also Duty Mgr Johanne. 

I for sure will return to Bai again.",4,2022-12-06

865848533,"After checking out only 10 minutes ago I feel compelled to write this review about a truly wonderful hotel. We booked Hotel Bai expecting not much being a 3 star hotel. Wow. We were wrong. From the moment we pulled up at the impressive hotel we felt the warmth of the porters who greeted us with a smile and the signature hand gesture of the hotel. We passed through airport style security screening which was fast and easy and checked in to a desk of many smiling staff. The room was spacious, clean and modern and we had the best night sleep. The hotel has impressive facilities including a modern gym with good equipment, an amazing rooftop and pool, and roof deck to enjoy the late night entertainment. The buffet food was brilliant, the pool was amazing. A hotel having these facilities already makes it special however it‚Äôs the wonderful staff of Bai Hotel that.make it unforgettable. I had a chance to thank Aljohn (Buffet Manager)  and Camille (Assistant GS Mgr) who managed to spare a few minutes to talk to me in their hectic days. We can‚Äôt wait to come back and highly recommend this hotel. ",5,2022-10-24

865459258,"Let me start off by saying the hotel is very nice and staff are friendly however ‚Ä¶..The policies at which this hotel runs off of is quite ridiculous‚Ä¶ 

Pros:
Room service was quick and delish 
Taxis and transport are easy to catch 

Cons:

at the entrance you are required to walk through a metal detector and have your bags scan through X-ray. 

No water fill stations so you are required to continuously use plastic water bottles 

Secondly they will allow no outside drink or food if not purchased from around the resort. 

And lastly you will be charged for using hand towels/ face towels if they determine there is a  ‚Äústain‚Äù I guess they want to make sure that the towels are cleaner than your face‚Ä¶",2,2022-10-21
864721298,"The food and the ambience was great! They have a large bariety of cuisine and types of food to choose from. Our server Glenn was also very friendly and very talented. When its your birthday, you can trust that the Bai team will make it extra soecial for you.",4,2022-10-16
864720446,"Hotel itself is nice. Good value for money. Location is also ideal as it is near the airport and also near the city center. Room was spacious and clean. 

Cons: 
the doors does not close properly. You have to check twice to make sure that its locked

Door card keys did not work twice

The Night Duty Manager was very condescending. After airing out the disappointment in service to which I said I was not happy at all, all he said was just ‚ÄúOk‚Äù . No service recovery whatsoever. I think his name is Nars or Nards or something 

Pro:

Breakfast spread was great. The F&B service was superb and the dining staff were all very nice and attentive. Plus factor for the taho

The water in the shower feels good, like it has a softener or something, made you feel really refreshed",2,2022-10-16

I loved rooftop swimming pool.
But the misery experience happened.

So we booked it and eat there.

But at the time of payment they insisted 
50% off is not applicable to kid.

They should make it clear on condition.
Of course they did not mention on their condition.

This hotel is not trustful.
I felt they are greed.

I will not stay again of course.",1,2022-10-15

856699311,"Check-in was pretty much standard.  

Over-all, I got the impression that the hotel was not being maintained well.  The carpeting in the corridors leading to my room was musty and needed a good shampooing.  My room was spacious and the bathroom was clean. The sitting areas along the corridors were a bit dusty.  

Cafe Bai breakfast buffet offered a lot of dishes, but were quite average.  The cheese and cold cuts selection was pathetic.  I would rather have a limited yet well curated good quality dishes rather than an extensive selection of bad to average food offerings.  Because of the quality of the breakfast, I opted not to do Cafe Bai for dinner, despite of the reasonable rates.  

The hotel management/owners should seriously consider upgrading their facilities maintenance and also their anchor food outlet (I did not try their other outlets, so I do not know if they are better than Cafe Bai in terms of food quality).",3,2022-08-27

856509482,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well. 

Departure was fairly smooth, though.",4,2022-08-26

It is ideally located. The food is delicious and the restaurants are excellent, the staff is extremely kind and ready to do anything to make you happy. But this time we were really disappointed with the condition of the rooms. They smell of humidity, black stains of humidity everywhere, not very clean, stains of dirt we even had a visit from a cockroach. The television system is also a little faulty. The other negative point is the accounting of expenses.
We had made a deposit of 6000 pesos by credit card but at the roof top they refused to put the bill on my room because I had supposedly not made a deposit. When I went to reception, they confirmed my deposit and they told me that they had to investigate, I never heard back from this investigation...
In short, it is very high time to renovate the rooms, it is good to be very strict on safety and on protective measures against covid-19, but not at the expense of the cleanliness of the rooms. Otherwise I think it will be the last time we will come to this hotel.",3,2022-08-08

840144691,"I've been here about 6 days. Everything is great about this hotel except for two big things. It is basically a 4-star hotel in every way imaginable but has 1-star hotel beds and 1-star hotel internet. If it weren't for the phenomenal, consistent & superb customer service rendered by Medardo on a daily basis I would have long been gone to a hotel that has better stable wifi connectivity & much better beds. The internet crashes a lot and you spend a lot of time looking at a spinning cursor which it absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that is great in every way besides what appears to resemble dial-up speeds and connectivity regardless of what the numbers say. It's very obvious the hotel is bottlenecking data to the extreme just to save money at the customer's expense with available bandwidth. The other complaint is the mattress selections. The quality in them cannot be compared because there is none. It is almost as hard as laying on the ground. I saw this complaint in a review before I booked here but gave it the benefit of the doubt. That was a mistake. The rooftop restaurant/bar is great too with beautiful scenery as well as the one on the 21st floor. Great dining areas too in their cafe on the 2nd floor. Very easy to get a taxi here as well and their shuttle is flexible for trips to places too. So Bai hotel if you are listening, fix the two things above and you'll see your reviews and reception from the public not to mention future sales peak to its highest capacity ever. Keep doing the great things you're doing like employing staff like Medardo and others that render great customer service and make it so it's easier to reach staff on your phone services too. Other runner-ups to work on is the amount of time it takes to get between floors or get an elevator at all. The internet is an absolute deal-breaker for me to ever return.",4,2022-05-26

837412944,"Needless to say, the hotel's facilities are excellent, and the gym is state-of-the-art and even has a sauna.

There is also a trainer on staff, Noel, who is the best trainer I have ever had. He creates a customized menu for you, and after your workout, he will stretch you and give you a massage. This allows me to live without muscle aches and pains after training.

I would recommend Noel's personal training to anyone who lives in Cebu, not just hotel guests, as they can use this gym.",5,2022-05-06

The staff at cafe bai are welcoming and accomodating. I even noticed the guard in the lobby disinfecting the taxi before loading passengers.

835920766,"Hotel is relatively far from the malls except for a smaller mall whose name I forgot. No high end shoes store like Nikes and Adidas.
The hotel looks very nice and the room is clean, being a business hotel, don‚Äôt expect a closet.
The TV is very small, but LED .
The buffet breakfast is decent, nothing spectacular, no longanisa which should be a staple for Filipino breakfast.
I also tried the dinner breakfast. The Cebu lechon meat was a bit hard and the skin was not at all crispy.
Japanese tempura was always out of stock. They hardly replenished.  Again, the dinner buffet failed to impress me.
Smoking area, for those who smoke, was near the driveway outside a coffee shop, but the coffee shop closed very early.
Other smoking area was in a small square in the pool area. 
I would stay there again, but maybe try the steak restaurant or the Japanese restaurant on the 2nd floor.
One gripe, the floor of the shower didn‚Äôt drain properly as the floor didn‚Äôt have enough slope for the water to flow into the drain.",4,2022-04-24

It was our first time in Cebu, so wasn't sure how to get around. We called concierge and Bryan gave us great recommendations! On top of that, he personally contacted tour guides to make sure we were safe and having fun. He exceeded our expectations, could not have asked for a better staff member to look after us. We will be back again for sure!",5,2022-04-21

Breakfast Buffet ‚ùå

Booked a room for 3 with breakfast and was disappointed with the buffet spread. I had high expectations since they were charging almost a thousand peso per pax but I found it not totally worthy of the price. I think they were after the quantity over the quality of the food they serve for breakfast.

To be specific, their corned beef was like from the cheapest can you would find in the market. I also found it ironic thinking that we were in Cebu but they  even didn‚Äôt serve Chorizo de Cebu. There were sausages though but again, the quality was meh. The pancake was a disappointment as well.",3,2022-04-01
832962497,"Visited Cebu to finalise my Visa and stayed at the Bai Hotel,very large and impressive,the staff were very friendly and helpful. As we got in the room it was like an Ice box compared to outside 17 degrees temp wouldn't adjust maintenance came and adjusted it it went to 25 degrees hot and sticky wouldn't go down and so loud we couldn't sleep.  In 45 years in construction i have never seen a bathroom without some form of ventilation,1 shower and every surface in the bathroom  is dripping wet. Breakfast was a large selection but unfortunately even things like eggs and bacon were were already cold. 
Not my idea of a 5 star Hotel.",2,2022-03-31

The staff are very professional, accommodating and keen to details especially to my special requests. We enjoyed  the food at Caf√© Bai. My little boy craved for sushi but it‚Äôs not available in the buffet display during breakfast, but when I asked Narcie about it, he didn‚Äôt hesitate to give us some, fresh from the fridge. I‚Äôd like to also particularly commend the enthusiastic and maniacal attitude displayed by the service crew, namely Marnel, Rachel, Loyd, Cherry, Angel, Brian and the rest. Me and my family had a great experience during our stay at Bai Hotel and we would definitely come back for more exciting staycations ahead. Keep up the good work and God bless our economy.

Kudos to all the staff who were very hospitable and polite. They would make sure that your needs were attended to.
Special mention to Mr. Ben in the pool area and to Mr. Mondares of housekeeping and his team. They would really assist you in any ways they can.

I had been travelling all over the world and its the first time in my life that a hotel didnt try to help us with our bookings.During the typhoon i had booked a room but they cant ammend or alter my booking, not even guided me on what to do. I booked through a known hotel site and still keep referring me for a bloody third party booking which the customer service cant even tell me what it is! THE CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTANTS IS incompetent and cant even facilitate the needs of its customers. Theres  a lot of fine hotels in cebu and this one i cant recommend to you.
