7820264,"Room was not superbly clean: the couch and ottoman chair were dirty with stains. Some dust accumulation on the corners, behind the curtains. The door jamb was rotting at the bottom, hinges were rusted. Tiles were a bit dirty.

The elevator from the basement was quite rundown.

At 9am someone rang our doorbell 3x just to ask if we needed anything from them. I found that to be a nuisance rather than helpful. 

At 10:20am we got a call asking if we wanted to extend our stay and reminded us of the 11am check out. This made us feel they were in a hurry to get us out of the hotel.

Mind you, their check in time is late at 3pm and check out is quite early at 11am. That gives them 4 hours of cleaning time yet the room was not clean enough to the standard we were expecting.

The staff were all very courteous though.

But because our overall experience was not satisfactory, we will not be visiting again in the near future nor recommend them to friends or family.",2.5,2023-01-09

7266604,"FACILiTIES - The only ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù you can do is the pool at the 21st floor. It is a safe option when you have a kid who knows how to swim but not yet that skillfull. Downside cannot use it when it rain and there‚Äôs lightning. Not Happy that we were not allowed to bring the pool towel to our room, imagine a shivering kid.
CHECK In/Check Out- It is not my firsttime but the staff at check in seemed lost. My voucher says it is already paid and was asked for payment again bec. They said that the payment was not reflected. I insisted  to the extent of showing confirmation that my cc was charged. It took awhile for it resolved. Check out was not hassle free made wait for 10mins.  
ROOM- Hotel is small, rooms smaller, small bathroom that you need to go to the other side ,close the door so you can reach the shower area, no iron &board in the room. Broken hair dryer, we had to switch rooms bec the first we had didn‚Äôt have any electricity.
Food- great selection ranges 1-1500 pesos
Accessibility- the hotel is near parkmall, Sm city and other resto but You NEEd car as it is not a safe area too many snatchers/hold upers. Taxi is an option which the hotel can get it for you. 
LOCATION- good when you need a place to stay coming or going to cebu port.
