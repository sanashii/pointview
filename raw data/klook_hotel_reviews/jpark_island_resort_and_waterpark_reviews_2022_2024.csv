1711935524,"JPark was an absolutely amazing place to stay and the staff was incredibly friendly, helpful, and over all incredible. The property is great and very family friendly. The multiple pools and huge variety of children‚Äôs activities made it a great family vacation. But I really can‚Äôt say enough about the staff. The people really made it special for us and always made sure our kids (4 and 6 years old) had a great time. Really above and beyond. As is typical for resorts, the property is an island of luxury amidst the bustle of a city, but it was easy to get around as needed. By far the most family friendly vacation we‚Äôve been on, catering to the kids and parents  alike. ",5.0,2024-04-01

1687394787,"The resort staff was amazing.  The rooms were clean but a bit dated.  The restaurants were ok but didn't have a great variety.  The breakfast buffet was great.  The Chinese restaurant was also very good.  The pool, water park and ocean beach area was maintained well and clean.  The beach bar had good drinks.  The casino which is connected but not part of hotel was disappointing and not very welcoming.  The majority of the customers seem to be Korean and it was difficult chatting with other guests. 
The suite was well appointed and had 1.5 baths to help with kids. The only strange thing was the lack of Filipino style toilet facilities, no hose or bucket.  I noticed, as with other hotels, a lack of towels in the room.  It is necessary to call for towels especially if you shower before dinner and in the morning.  The staff was very helpful and delivered towels or ice on request.  
It was a good resort for families. ",4.0,2023-06-22
1686089200,"It‚Äôs a very good property for kids and toddlers, it has all kinds of pools and water sports onsite. But the property is very ruin down and need major renovations. Outside of the property is extremely dangerous for pedestrians, people with strollers simply has no place here at all what so ever",3.0,2023-06-07
1685421692," I just arrived at 13:30. I asked to check in and it was very humid and hot, but I could get in after waiting for more than 2 hours. What's more incomprehensible is that even when I went to the front desk at 3 o'clock, the room was not cleaned, staff didn't answer exactly when I could enter the room.. Also, during check-in, There is no excuse for the customer even though the check-in process is delayed. the front desk staff don't focus on the service and they just answer the phone or continue to chat with colleagues around them.. I don't know how many stars it is, but customer service is really terrible.",2.0,2023-05-30
