 Too busy and over crowded 
It's too expensive, not good value for money.
Our family room bedding wasn't big enough for us 2 x double beds put together for a family of 4

Only 2 towels provided 

Pricing was ridiculous for Asia and especially the Philippines' food , and drinks was as dear if not more expensive than Singapore.

They provided 3 tubes for the Amazon River and made you pay for everything else.

Small beach ball 700 pesos 
Snorkel and mask 2700 pesos

Everything other than your breakfast, accommodation, and pools was an additional cost.

I would recommend this place it's overcrowded and expensive and caters to mainly South Korean holidaymakers.

 Maintenance problems, balcony screen doors that fell off the ledge when I tried to slide it open and I had to grab and reinstall the screen door myself. Luckily this screen door did not fall on my family members.  There was a door metal plate (next to the bolt) that was improperly placed and whose sharp edge was protruding which nearly cut my wife's finger. The metal was being held by regular plastic tape! Evidently your staff did a bad job of placing the metal plate

I can feel that they just think the customer as stupid Korean who doesn't know how to speak English but will spend money. We stay at Jpark for 7 days. We found out there is another swimming pool behind building G right before we leave. It wasn't even on the map. We were so pissed off. Nobody told us about the swimming pool even when we check in.

 The staff was very friendly and professional. The spa was the highlight of the trip as far as adult things go. Our daughter (2yo) was having the time of her life at the pool and slides.
 The facility is not properly maintained, the pools are all cracked and need to be repainted/sealed the Jay Park Island sign is basically gone from the top of the building which makes me think that it was put together unsafely. The pororo Park was disgusting my daughter didn't mind but the water play area had so much debris the entire kids indoor experience was very unsanitary. It  was 28 USD for me to go with my daughter to Porroro Park and it was absolutely not worth it. A lot of the activities were either broken or poorly maintained. 

The check-in experience was horrible. I reserved our room with a king bed one month prior and it wasn't ready at our 3:00 p.m. check-in time they tried to ""upgrade"" us to a villa which seemed great but we were in that room for less than 5 minutes because it smelled and there was mold in the bathroom. We ended up getting the room that we actually paid for and finally checked in at about 4:20 p.m.. 

The food was terrible as far as good healthy selections go, an exception to this was the Chinese restaurant which we ate at twice, the Korean restaurant was also pretty good. Coral and the j lounge and the pool lounge restaurant all basically have the same menu and are very overpriced for what it is. I ordered tacos and my wife ordered caprese salad. The tacos were sloppy with most of it being different sauces with very little meat. The caprese salad seem to have had a pesto sauce on it that tasted like cut grass. Even when we ordered pancit, the flavor was there but the ingredients were not fresh. 

The bartenders were very slow and the entire staff seemed overwhelmed and not prepared for the amount of people that were there. They were, however, friendly and professional.",6.0,2022-12-23T08:10:07+07:00

 We stayed in a family suite as a treat for our kids after a month of travel in the Philippines. This was the only 5 star resort we stayed in.... And it felt like it. Very grand, the options at the buffet breakfast were over and above anything we had seen. The waterpark, was, of course the highlight for our kids aged 8, 10 &11. In 24 hours we spent almost every waking moment here. So fun!

 Fantastic place for young kids. A number of swimming pools that cater for babies, toddlers and older kids with lots of pool beds that had shade. The pool bar was also great, and you could order food as well. The food options were great, there are a number of restaurant options with good food and service. Also the nighttime entertainment was excellent too. We had a great time.
 It was a bit annoying that you had to pay extra for the Pororo play area and also for the Segway cars. Also the pools probably need a bit of maintenance as some of the paint at the bottom was peeling off. The decor in the rooms was a bit dated too but that didn’t really matter as the rooms was spotless and the beds were comfortable. Location was not the best if you want to go out at night (in Cebu for example) as it about a 15 minute drive from Cebu. But if you’ve got small kids it’s perfect as you can have dinner at the resort each night.",9.0,2022-10-10T02:43:14+07:00

 Hotel is dated, especially the waterpark.  Needs a huge revamp.  This hotel was much better than the Shangri-la Mactan which we left early.
Motorised watersports were expensive.   We tried the banana boating and my kids & I were totally bored - was not an exciting ride at all.
For the price of the venue, the outdoor activities should be free, ie. mini golf, go-karts, etc.

The place is massive and has plenty of things to do for everybody. I particularly enjoyed the morning walk around the property after a restful sleep at our unit. We saw one of the best sunrises in the Philippines on our balcony.

 Five star hotel only in books. Destination is really managed poorly which is giving a terrible experience. i wouldn’t go back there even it was for free. The room was not clean and especially the bathroom, the pool was in a terrible and shabby condition as well as all most of the hotel’s common areas. You had to pay for almost all the hotel facilities (even for the table tennis and snooker). I reached there after 10 hours travel at 12:00 noon with my 4 year old daughter and the lady in reception asked me to pay another 500 pesos for early check in although I had informed them previously and the room was ready. Note that in my all other stays in other 5* hotels in Cebu I was never asked to pay. There is a general feeling that the hotel is abandoned and not proper care is given to keep the visitors happy and feel welcomed.

 UNFRIENDLY STAFF NEAR THE BIG SLIDE. He told us that go-pros were not allowed at all which was ok. We asked him for the direction of the lockers and he points us in the general direction where its at. He does it with a scowl though and is clearly tired of people asking him the same questions over and over again. He does see that my girlfriend was wearing a necklace and fails to tell us that too wasn't allowed. The lockers are a fair distance from the big slide so he could've mentioned it before we deposited our go-pro. When we came back to the slide, he told us we still weren't allowed to get on because of the necklace then points us to a sign with tiny letters and paragraphs telling us what we couldn't wear. Keep your signs simple. Use symbols. Hire a new guy there. If he's sick and tired of his job don't take it out on us. We got too upset to get on. Since the giant slide was the reason why I chose this resort over the others, it was disappointing that I never got on it. Never going here again. Aside from that, the resort caters well to children but keep in mind that since it's more family oriented, the breakfast buffet gets very full and very loud very fast.",5.0,2022-06-20T21:22:59+07:00

 The staff was very friendly. Room service was great
 only downside to this property was my fiancée and I had a mild skin reaction to the pool water. The hotel could’ve had maybe a few more food choices for international travelers.",8.0,2022-03-19T16:10:03+07:00

 The pool facilities was great including the staff.
 Nothing worked in the room. No cable. No ac in hotel
Hallways or elevators. Room are old and outdated. 
This is not a 5 star hotel by any means. Also breakfast area area has no AC, very uncomfortable to enjoy your meal.",3.0,2022-03-19T04:29:30+07:00

 Breakfast was good. I did not like the room, I have been to better rooms at 50% less their price. I expect at an expensive resort a better room with better view. The slides were closed including the pool that we wanted.
 Better room and better view. All pools must be open during the day.",3.0,2022-03-14T07:14:51+07:00
