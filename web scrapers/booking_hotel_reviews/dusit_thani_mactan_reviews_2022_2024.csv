 The staff at the hotel are undoubtedly its greatest asset. Their eagerness to assist and friendly demeanour greatly enhanced the overall experience. many of them even addressed my daughter by her name, which surely made her feel special and welcomed.

The water in the sea was crystal clear, offering a picturesque view. However, it is unfortunate that the mornings were marred by litter, requiring the staff to clean it before guests could enjoy the beach. This highlights the dedication and commitment of the staff to maintain a clean and enjoyable environment for everyone.
 What i didn't like was the children's activities were dependent on the weather and if there were any events on the boardwalk.  The hotel has a great playroom, however it is filled with inflatables only.  This is darkly lit in some areas and not well ventilated.   As there is a fee to join this playroom it would have been nice if there were other activities available for children including arts and crafts, shell crafts, and educational sessions about cebu sea life through colouring  for example.  This would be more engaging for children.

I found the sand was not real and hard for children to play with. Additionally, it would be great to have more tents / gazebos to provide shade for children as sun protection is essential.

It is unfortunate that there weren't many healthy choices on the menu.  Considering it is a family resort i didn't see a dedicated children's menu.  There were also no vegan or gluten free options.",6.0,2024-06-20T01:57:59+07:00

 We like how the staff treated us respectfully from check in to checkout. Everyone did a great job especially Christine at that check us in and Zee and her supervisor that took care of us at The View Lounge. The place has a lot to offer. Several dining options to choose from. The pool was the best part. The beach access was easy. The boardwalk was really nice to spend time and wait for sunset. The suite room with sea view was spacious for a family of 5 and we love the view from the balcony.  It was fairly clean as well as the restrooms. Included breakfast buffet did not disappoint.
 Room 2516 was hot when we came in and we thought the a/c was just turned on and still adjusting the temperature to our preferred setting. Voila! 3 hours later, the temperature inside the rooms (bedrooms and living room) remained at around 24  degrees Celsius even if we tried to set it up to around 20-22 degrees Celsius. We called front desk and they sent someone to check the first time and said just try to give it few minutes to adjust now. We closed the curtains to try and cool the rooms down without too much heat from the sun and we went to the pool for a couple of hours. When we came back it was still hot. We called front desk back and they sent somebody back the second time to check but nothing happened. So, we decided to just let it be since we were checking out the following day anyway. 

About 18 of us ate at Tradewinds during their Seafood Night Buffet with an agreeable price of around $34-$39 per person converted to US dollars. It was very disappointing because with that price they only offer WATER as your drink. Anything other than water adds up to your bill! What the heck is that? What kind of ""1st class"" buffet only comes with water with that kind of price? When we told the supervisor on duty our comment about it, he doesn't seem to care! Did not even comment back or even tried to do anything about our comment. 

The lobby was super hot as it is an open environment. The place needs more fan. At The View Lounge, their was only 1 fan shared by several guests there, We were not lucky enough to have it pointed on us until other people left about 9pm! We were there since 7:30 pm wiping our sweat off and hoping for more wind but it was not a windy or breezy night!",4.0,2024-06-07T07:16:30+07:00

 Great resort with the standard resort amenities. Decent private beach right behind resort. Loved the beach dinner event with buffet. Staff were always very super helpful and nice (though sometimes confused as different staff could give different answers).
 There was a corporate event for almost the entirety of our stay that blocked off several areas that would have been nice to enjoy. There were some noisy events in the evening but nothing super disruptive. Wish the beach was slightly nicer (or at least shuttles to nicer beaches) and there were more organized resort activities. We were told we had two double beds but they ended up being two twin beds. Wish TV allowed Netflix. TV was also broken - the screen would periodically go black so nothing watchable.",9.0,2024-06-04T06:17:21+07:00

 Okay, the location was a little on the further end. The staff was helpful and courteous, the accommodation was clean, and they gave us a free upgrade to a wonderful seaview.  Their large bed is the most comfy. We had a wonderful breakfast buffet option. Many hours were spent in their infinity pool. The area was kept up and kept clean all around. The Korean restaurant was rather good.
 We would prefer to watch Netflix or YouTube on their big screen TV, which is not an HD TV. I had to use my personal data wifi to complete some work because the internet was also sluggish. I like to play pool with my partner, but their cue sticks and billiard table weren't in great shape. We ordered pizza, beverages, and cocktails from Sunset Bar, and we felt it was decent considering the hotel's pricing.  We decide to get the most costly massage we have ever had since our final night. The service at NAMM SPA was appalling. It was a major letdown. After spending almost 10,000php on a 90-minute massage each for the two of us, we were dejected as we left the spa. The service was poor; there was no selection of oils given, and while the package claimed peppermint, I didn't smell any. When we first came, the room was unprepared, it was hot, and the air conditioner was hardly operating, they had to open the door. I coudnt breathe so I had to question the therapist why the AC was not working and room door is open. They moved us to another room they claimed was full where AC was working better. But I was already not in the mood.  No hot towel to wipe oils out of our body at the end of massage, feels like staff were in hurry to just go home. No choice of having tea inside the room after the massage but instead found the tea outside in the lobby. The massage itself was good and I would be happy to pay 799 for that service instead of 4800++/head . That was just disappointing!",6.0,2024-06-02T04:46:43+07:00

 We like the hospitality of the staff at every point of contact. At the check-in, we acknowledge Kevin and Ruth, at the buffet breakfast exceptional service from Kris who always made sure we had our favorite coffee and my sikwate and Mango everytime. The house keeping ladies Maria, Merry and Jeanie were doing a great job maintaining the cleanliness of our room and we particularly liked their personal notes .

The sunset bar Yukie were very friendly and engaging we always get a wave and warm smile every time we passed.

The lifeguards were friendly and pleasant and we always get warm greetings everytime we pass by.

We highly recommend Dusit Thani Mactan and it's incredible staff.
 I didn't like that there was no soap in the disabled toilet and  did not change even after we reported it. My husband is a liver transplatee and very important to keep in a sanitary environment. 

Also, there were day trippers in the smaller pool who brought a handheld karaoke machine and singing their lungs out, disturbing other guest. However, it was dealt with satisfactory with the staff.",10.0,2024-05-31T09:42:45+07:00

 Dusit was an amazing stay as I went here for 2 nights alongside my partner. Firstly I'd like to shoutout Ruth, Zee and Leo for their amazing service, they were so welcoming, kind and showed fantastic customer service throughout our stay.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun.

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience.

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep. The bathroom and balcony areas were also really nice and clean.

Overall Dusit deserves its 5/5 rating and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would come back to relax here in a heartbeat.

 Breakfast was very disappointing. They seem to be trying to make a buffet with the cheapest food possible. Considering the price to stay there this is unacceptable.  We also got burgers at the sunset bar at the hotel.  The buns on the burgers were dry and stale so I think they must have been 2 or 3 days old.  900 pesos for that disappointing meal.  Ordered a pizza and it came with absolutely no tomato sauce and one bite was enough to be turned off and send it back.   Everything here is overpriced and if its going to cost that much it should be very high quality but they are far below many hotels in Cebu like Citadines and Holiday inn where the food is excellent.",4.0,2024-05-12T07:51:06+07:00

 Did not have much western food as compared to other hotels/resorts in Cebu. However, the staff was very helpful and attentive,
 1.  The lobby was an open air lobby. It is not advertised as open air. At a resort most people want to enjoy the outdoor facilities but when inside you want to be comfortable and not continually exposed to the 104 degree Fahrenheit heat index.

2.  On the Sunday night of my stay, someone had rented an area for some function.  The music this group was playing was way too loud. My room was on the 5th floor and sounded like we were in the room next to the party. When I called the front desk to ask about the noise I was told the music/ function would be going until midnight.  When the music continued to interfere with us trying to sleep, I called again and asked to speak with the Duty  Manager. He said he would speak to them. The music turned down to a tolerable level but could still be heard on the fifth floor.  The music finally stopped around 10:45 pm. The resort should ensure that any function or activity does not inconvenient other paying guests.",3.0,2024-05-12T04:49:30+07:00

 Wow Dusit Thani! We have stayed at many 5-Star resorts, but rarely see one so dedicated to visitor services and enjoyment as Dusit Thani!! We used Dusit Thani as a “hub” for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.
 One bad thing we must point out. We stayed one night in a Club Room in Building 3 and the entire building and room smelled of mildew and was too hot out to open the windows. Yuck! Not sure if this is a persistent problem or not, but bad enough for us to never stay in that building again.",10.0,2024-05-04T22:59:57+07:00

 It's a great place with spacious and clean room with a fantastic view (if you paid for Seaview). Beds, shower etc are comfortable. 
An extremely large infinity pool, not too crowded even though it’s a big resort. It feels relaxing and the drinks near the pool are affrordable.
The restaurants are excellent, the breakfast buffet is very very good (my wife liked the Taho man, you can’t find him anywhere except at Dusit), the staff is fantastic.
 We stayed here before, end of 2022. The feeling between then and now is that there are less amenities in the room. No laundry bag, only two towels, limited cans with shower gel and shampoo and the conditioning was even missing. Looks like the hotel is doing their best to be good for the environment while they also think about saving money to keep the room price affordable during this period with high inflation. Not all decisions are bad but two towels and no conditioning while all the Filipina’s with long hair use it…….thats a wrong way of saving money. We called the reception and additional shower gel and shampoo was delivered, should not be the case.

 It really is a fantastic place. A very large resort area with multiple restaurants and bars, all of them good to very good. A decent private beach (as some reviewers mentioned the water is too shallow - maybe just check the tide times and have a swim when it's high tide, it's totally fine then). An extremely large infinity pool so it looks like it rarely ever gets crowded and feels nicely relaxed. 

The restaurants are excellent, the breakfast buffet is very very good, the staff is nothing short of fantastic.

Bear in mind, as some reviewers mentioned, this is a resort in a rather secluded area. You'd need a taxi to get anywhere else, unless you're fine buying stuff from nearby Sari-Sari stores or grab a beer with some local guys in a scruffy bar (which I'd actually recommend for a change of scenery). The resort character is exactly what you're here for though and you can see the location beforehand, so I don't see what's to complain about it.
 In general, the only noticeable minus is the pricing. Sure, this is a high-end resort, but even for that category it's pricey and at times feels like it's simply too much. Accommodation price seems justified, but for example prices for drinks or seafood buffet are definitely very high, and seem hard to justify on this level.",9.0,2024-04-18T06:10:56+07:00

 We had a pleasant stay. The staff was fantastic! They were incredibly accommodating to our 1-year-old, and the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the BBQ buffet was also quite good. The playroom was a big hit with our little one, though it was surprising to find there was an extra daily fee to use it.
 While the breakfast and BBQ buffets offered good variety, there weren't many options for toddlers outside of those times. It was disappointing that the evening buffets weren't always available. Be aware of potentially loud music by the pool, especially in the evenings. This was disruptive, particularly with a young child trying to sleep.

 Sea views, giant pool and excellent breakfast buffet are the main reasons to book this hotel. The Thai restaurant has a few excellent dishes (Tom kha gai, Mango sticky rice).  Sports bar is fun and a good chill spot. The Club Lounge has a lovely afternoon tea set, but is otherwise a barren space that is under-utilized and unwelcoming.
 Many mechanical issues in both rooms, and furniture needs an update. Walls were too thin, could hear neighbor family. The Korean restaurant should be skipped entirely. Location is remote, with bumpy and dirty access roads.  Very hard to get Grab/Taxi.",7.0,2024-02-29T00:36:29+07:00

 Upon arrival, the space was extravagant - it was spacious, clean, and simply beautiful. The staff greeted us, and we started to get a glimpse of how exceptionally and seriously the staff took hospitality. From then on, we were greeted with a smile and a hello or good morning by the workers every day, and this made us feel very valued and seen as customers. Their hospitality was at times almost too much, but I suppose its only a good thing to say that the service was too good, or the people too nice. When dining, they saw the smallest details, and truly made our stay feel very special. 
The dining itself was very good. For the breakfast, they have a variety of food that fits both Asian and Western tastebuds, which was great for an interracial couple like ourselves. I liked that we could have our breakfast outside on the terrace and enjoy the views of the ocean as we ate our breakfast. The swimming pool is very clean, big, and we liked that we could order food and drinks by the pool area. 
For the room, it was much better than expected. We liked that it was just as the picture, if not better. The bed is big, the bathroom is nice, and the view is gorgeous - it was very satisfactory. 
We tried the spa facilities, and it was very nice.
 The location is not good. If you believe that the resort can provide everything you need, and that you will have no interest in leaving the resort, and exploring what Cebu is actually like for normal people - then don't worry about what I'm writing. The location is near the airport ... and that's about it. If you're staying there for a longer time, and get tired of the same food, same vibe, and same activities every day - the location doesn't have many other options for other things to explore. My suggestion would be to book an island hopping tour to get out and see some of Cebu, if you can afford the expensive options the hotel provides then go for it, it's a great way to get outside the bubble of the resort. However, these tours all mean that you have to drive for hours to get to the main sights, so if you're someone who wants to do water activities, or go sightseeing, I'd suggest a place in the city or somewhere near what you want to see. 

I wish there was a convenience store in the resort or a small booth that can provide products such as period products, or cigarettes. I called the room service line to ask if they were able to provide period products, or if that was something avaliable to buy at the resort, but unfortunately it is not. Make sure you bring what you need I guess, as the location doesn't provide much ability to go outside and get small things you need.",8.0,2024-02-28T12:28:21+07:00

 My stay at Dusit Thani was a great overall experience. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, the facilities are in excellent condition and the overall ambiance is also very nice, calm and relaxing. The pool is nice (it could be a bit deeper for my taste but it is ok), and the resort was not too crowded (I was there in the second week of February). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner can be taken at a variety of bars and restaurants, all of which had good food and a great view. The photos of the property really do reflect the place well.

On a side note: the fitness center is quite nice and one can get a decent workout in between relaxing at the pool and dinner!
 The location is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is close to the airport whilst not being affected by airport noise. On the other hand the road infrastructure there is less than excellent, and depending on the traffic it can either take 20 minutes or 90 minutes to get to and from the airport. Also, there isn't much around to see. I was planning on relaxing in the resort so this did not bother me at all, but if you want to explore a bit on foot it might not be the most exciting area as you have to take a taxi/grab to get to the next best starbucks. 

And, on a more related note: whilst the pool is great, the private beach is quite small and the ocean there is not suitable for swimming as it is quite shallow.",9.0,2024-02-20T05:34:07+07:00

 nice interiors, 
good wifi
clean (big praise to the cleaning staff), 
the staff, in general, gives the appearance of being there to assist. 
the front office did try to resolve our issues by offering some extra when we brought up the issues we encountered
 Despite being 95% full occupancy, they did not have enough loungers set out by the pool. Unbelievably, on the first day we were told to sit on chairs(!) by the bar instead of arranging for extra lounges to be brought to the pool. In the following days, we raced to the pool to get a spot; not what I would expect in a 5-star resort.
Cocktails were constantly a hit-and-miss.
Every single time we wanted to order something they seemed to have run out of items. One day I wanted a smoothie, but I almost had to settle for Coca-Cola instead. How does a 5-star hotel run out of bananas or coconut in a tropical country when they are sold at every corner?! Every morning for breakfast there were bananas in the buffet restaurant but there were none at the pool bar for an afternoon cocktail or a smoothie(!?) How does a 5-starts resort run out of nachos and Royal (Fanta)? These are all items on the menu, not fancy requests of a spoiled customer. I don't believe these are hard-to-get or delicate items that cannot be stored for a long time. To then be told that it is because they had lots of customers for the Chinese New Year was the cherry on the cake. As if the event came as a surprise and they could not prepare for it. No one wants to spend so much money to travel this far (bear in mind the place is well isolated) and then hear such a sad excuse. All of this wouldn't bother me too much in other circumstances, but it is less acceptable in a 5-star hotel that puts on so much of a show. As a customer, when I choose a 5-star resort I do not want to find myself torn between whether I should keep compromising on my (not so unrealistic) expectations or spend my time making complaints and spoiling my inner peace.",6.0,2024-02-19T17:51:10+07:00

 The hotel is at a lovely location, once you get to it. We arrived at Mactan via ferry, and the hotel was an hour's ride through heavy traffic and some narrow streets.  Same narrow streets en route to the airport, but only a 30-minute drive. The infinity swimming pool is huge, about 100m long, and it was not too busy during our visit. The view across the sea to the mountains on Cebu island is lovely. The breakfast had good variety, but the cooks at the egg station had the smallest pan possible, a huge queue at the station, and were trainees: we never got properly cooked eggs and the wait was very long. The restaurants all (aside from the (fancy)Thai, on the second floor), all had outdoor seating and views of the sea.  The feather pillows and duvet are super comfy!

We stayed in tower 3 and the room was extremely cold with staff having set the aircon as low as possible. When we turned the aircon off we discovered why - the room dripped with condensation and there was a strong smell of mold. My partner and I both left with terrible sinus infections. We did not ask to move again as we had already been shifted from another room where the toilet dripped and there was loud construction noise until late at night outside our room. Our friends stayed in another room and also had the smell of sewage in their room. Dusit Thani should not be allowing people to occupy these rooms as it is extremely detrimental to people's health, particularly anyone with respiratory issues. The quality of construction in the rooms is also very poor with wonky tiles, walls and uneven floors - not 5 star standard",2.0,2024-01-11T04:34:23+07:00

 The room could have been cleaner.  When we arrived there was hair in the bathroom from other guests.  In addition, we could not have breakfast on the day of our leaving as our flight was too early.  They provided a breakfast in a box but the pastries were rock hard and the egg sandwich was less than to be desired.  This was disappointing as we paid a good amount for the breakfast.

 Room was very nice and the breakfast provided was the best experienced during our trip to the Philippines. The selection of FILO foods was very appreciated.
 - Cost of doing laundry was crazy expensive!
- Cost of the bar drinks was literally twice the price of drinks in other 4/5 star hotels we stayed at. 
- Staff at reception could be more helpful. 
1. They were unable to help book a reservation at House of Lechon in the city. We managed to independently go and make our reservation. 
2. One morning we booked an early morning tour. We communicated this to reception in order to arrange our continental breakfast to go. The breakfast received was very ordinary. One sandwich without any juices or bottled water. We specifically asked for iced coffee and juices. 
3. Separately we asked reception to book a taxi for us on the morning we were leaving. Staff did not make this booking and consequently we nearly missed the ferry we had booked.",7.0,2024-01-01T04:59:09+07:00

In all areas, the staff were polite and very kind.

 From beginning to end: horrible stay - avoid this place at all cost

1. Room
Without asking, and without being told, I was apparently upgraded to a better room upon arrival. However, the room I was put in, which is building 3, was another level of disappointing. Sure, the room is spacious and had an ocean view but unless the AC was put on high at 20 degrees the room would start to literally sweat. water dripping from the walls, completely wet floor in the bathroom/toilet which is dangerous as extremely slippery, bed sheets were wet after a while so were my own clothes. It took half a day and me calling about 5 times for the hotel to find a solution. By the way, their initial proposal was to downgrade me with little to no apology. The new room I was in, had exactly the same issue. The hotel is just not build well. They called the « engineering team » about 3 times which proposed every time the solution of simply putting the AC at 20 degrees: this is not a solution, unless you want your customers to all become sick and catch a cold.
Most funnily, the first reaction of the staff was to say this situation was because I left the windows open, which I did not: putting the blame on the client and letting them deal half a day in a humid, wet rooms that smells like you are in an underground cave is not the best.

2. Room Service
Ordered a greek salad and a burger. The burger first came without the steak patty in it: so just buns and salad. The salad had half of the things mentioned in the menu. Tomato and feta cubes roughly cut with some salad leaf on top: no olive oil, seasoning. The cocktail, which was a pina colada, also did not have the coconut cream it mentioned to have in the menu. After complaining for the burger, a new one, or should I say the same one was delivered back just adding the overcooked patty that was missing. Fries were cold, so as the bun. They also brought a new salad, still the greek salad, although I did not ask for it.",1.0,2023-12-29T07:12:57+07:00

 The hotel exceeded my expectations. The open lobby had a beautiful tree out for Christmas. There were a few varieties of places to get drinks and food. Not many local food options for lunch and dinner, but I am not a foodie, so I didn't mind the more international choices for food. The pool is spacious and I never had an issue getting chairs at various times throughout the day. I loved that the pool was open late, until 10 pm. The breakfast was great - so many options for different types of food & lots of local food options to try.
 The location was quite remote. Honestly, I did not mind this at all. We barely left the hotel grounds beyond going to eat in Cebu City one day and for massages at Cacao Tree Spa about 10 min away. There wasn't much to do close by in Cebu City as a lot of the attractions are further away on the island. It took about 30 min to get to the airport and about 45 min to get to Cebu City because of traffic. The hotel is very helpful at getting taxis when you want to leave the hotel. If you get stir crazy, maybe not the best hotel choice. I enjoyed the hotel itself because it had enough to keep me occupied and feed me for my vacation as we were aiming to relax and hang out.",10.0,2023-12-25T04:29:57+07:00

 The food is quite pricy for the taste/quality. The beach is very small and not sandy as promised. I guess therefore few people are using it (which is good if you like it quiet).

 Staff that will just say “yes ma’m,” with arrogance, instead of “sorry,” when you make a disappointing observation. As if to tell you, that’s how five star hotel works and have to deal with it. They charge me the full price of my 3 nights stay as a security deposit(my stay was already fully paid before I arrived), booking.com states the security deposit will be 3k pesos, when I asked them about why full price, they told me it’s gonna be back to my account at check out, at check out, Kevin the front desk person told me, when I inquired, it’s gonna take 2 weeks to return to my account, didn’t asked me if I needed help for my luggages and just turned his back as soon as he told me I’m all set. I’ve been hauling our luggages without anybody helping us, they’ve just moving on and pretending they don’t see me and my companion, I’ve seen them full force with foreign guests. You have to bring slippers for the bathroom, the design is weird, water floods all the way to the adjacent toilet bowl and it’s gonna be wet all day, have to open the window when you take a shower, ventilation doesn’t seem right, windows will be covered in mist/fog. The place is secluded from the modern(convenience store) amenities. If you’re the kind of person who stays in the room, at the bar, at the poolside, you’ll be ok. But if you need something else, getting a grab ride will take a while, they have a hotel taxi which can cost a lot. Thy have free shuttle going to Robinson’s galleria(2x a day), free shuttle to a mall but not to the airport. The place is secluded but can be crowded, security guards are men with their handheld radios, with their stiff facial expressions, they don’t appear hospitable at all. I don’t mind paying for something that is to my expectations(5 star that is), this place is not worth what I paid for.",3.0,2023-08-22T08:09:14+07:00

 If Heaven on Earth exists, The Dusit Thani certainly feels like such a place. The sunsets, atmosphere, absolute carefree environment. Resort is brand new, ideal for a couple that wants to do nothing but spend quality time together. The pool is amazing, with stunning views of the mountains and ocean. It is like a movie set. I have stayed in resorts all over the world, its not that this was the fanciest place, it is that the staff here is so very special. Warm, Attentive, friendly. I guess if I worked in a paradise like this, I would be happy everyday. The breakfast buffet is very special. The fruit here taste like nothing we have in the US, homemade organic honeys, juices, out of this world. Thai rest also, amazing, wonderful experience. The pool bar food, also excellent, loved the pizza. The oceanview room is a nice large size, with a great sized balcony. The room has a great fridge also. Some thanks you's to Wonderful staff, Enan, The rest. Manager, Ravi the Chef, Friendly Mary, part of the breakfast team, and Niki from the pool bar. No amount of money is a big enough tip for these wonderful people here. My girlfriend and I will be back to the Dusit Thani sometime this year, and I cant Wait.

 1) Resort is really nice.  The view bar area is truly a great spot to hang out.
2) Staff were extremely friendly to myself and my mother who are from the US.
3) Service was exception for myself and my mother who are from the US.
4) The infinity pool is quite a treat.  
5) There is a kids play area that is indoors which we didn't know about until we got there.  It was really fun for our 4 year old son, and they do provide supervision at all times while children are playing in the area.  300 PHP for 1 hour or 600 PHP for the full day.
 1) My biggest issue was the service to my wife and mother in law who are native to the Philippines.  They were guests just like myself and my own mother, but when I was not in the vicinity of them.. the service was a completely different experience.  The staff would not do simple things like refilling water at the table, and they would not make eye contact and engage them either.  I remember returning to the resort after island hopping carrying a bag full of snorkeling gear and not one person even asked to look in the bag.  That same bag the prior day when we returned my mother in law was carrying it.. and when I was not with her entering the resort they made issue of it and searched the bag.. and made her go through a metal detector. (as another example)  My wife was quite upset with this fact, and it bothers me as well.  Every guest should be treated with the same level of service.  
2) There is a corkage fee to bring a single bottle of wine from outside into your room, and that was 1500PHP per bottle.  What was surprising about that is you can purchase a bottle of wine in their deli at the resort for 500-700PHP on the low end. The front desk agent told me that the bottles in the deli  were all 1500PHP.
3) Could not find spa service pricing anywhere online for the resort spa.  The only way to see pricing was to go to the spa when it was open and come to find that the prices at the resort spa are the same price you would pay in the US for full body massage for example.  You can take a taxi to two nearby spas (5 minute drive) and only pay 27$ US for a full body 90 minute massage.  Quite interesting that they don't advertise the pricing considering this fact.
4) There really isn't much beach front.  There was a tiny manmade beach one one side of the resort, and it was not appealing at all.",5.0,2023-03-09T16:47:44+07:00

 Overall, this hotel and its amenities are great with wonderful breakfasts, amazing massages and a beautiful pool.
 It could benefit from more options for food as well as a place to purchase convenience store items.

I mention more options for food because the Sunset Sports bar is very underwhelming in its service. The food is not bad but when you see customers left waiting, to get orders or receive their change,  it doesn't leave a good impression. Not to mention waiters unable to inform customers of an item of food change from a menus dish until it arrived and was asked about it.",7.0,2023-02-27T15:04:21+07:00

 Bed was comfy, food was good and plenty. 
Nothing else there is too like.
This hotel nowhere a 5 star resort and shouldn't even be carrying the prestigious name Dusit.
I need to comment Kevin who has been doing a great job in the beach bar and serving us at the pool. Good job..
 Low quality materials used for the way too small rooms. Rooms looks like a 89$ city hotel and not like a 5 star resort room you charge $300 per night. It's completely laughable. If you present such room to travelers in Bali, Phuket or Phu Coq you might have a riot at your hands. This hotel only exists to cater to Korean tourists. Every expat or local who knows what a real 5 star hotel is like will avoid this place like the plague. We are so disappointed.
No balcony, view is facing an ugly blue condo bldg.
No shower separation, water runs free in the bathroom like in a cheap roadside motel.
Upon arrival bags were taken out of our hands without a greeting, not a word. Handed a luggage stub. NO WELCOME DRINK, nothing.
The worst unhelpful concierge ever. Unprofessional behaviors by staff all 3 days. Waiter asked me at the view bar where I'm from, when I replied that I'm German he said "" oh wow, that's from where Hitler was, that very bad president, I saw Schindlers List and needed to cry"" Excuse me ??????
Coffee and hot chocolate are served without saucer. Dishes at the pool ignored for hrs even dozens of time staff passed by. Hot chocolate for 250 pesos which is just Swiss miss and no hot chocolate.
Does the manager ever do a walkabout on the premises? Trash everywhere in the garden, same as swimming tissues in the pool and whatnot..I'm completely speechless.
I stayed in Dusit hotels over, just recently in Davao and BKK which both were fantastic in terms of staff and room etc. This place is nothing but an unprofessional overpriced tourist trap for Koreans.
Upon check out of course no receipt was given. He didn't even put the SOA in an envelope to hand it to me, he simple kept it. No OR. Hello BIR?
We left for the airport, 3 staff behind the FO jokingly entertaining themselves, several bellboys only chatting, not even looking at us bringing our own luggage to the car. The worst of the worst ever.

 1) Staff is friendly and tries to help within their boundaries
2) Price range is within my budget given I am not willing to pay too much when most of the time i am not in the hotel. Other hotels like shangri-la or Shenton would have been too pricey. However it is still steep and comparable price to certain 5 star hotels back in Singapore
3) Availability of services like Pool, dining in restaurants (given the distance to everything else you may wish to have a nice dinner in the hotel after a day of tours), 24 hr room service etc.
 - Digital TV with the channels did not work for 2 days which I always like to turn on as background noise when I am in the room.  No attempts at service recovery though its not a huge matter for me since I am not always in the room. A simple later check out time even by 1 hr would be nice but no such offer even though I asked for one.
- Walls are super thin. At 1 point I can heard our next door neighbors having their conversation as though they were standing right next to me. I feel bad since I have early days (4am hours) and getting ready would have disturbed them.
- Taxis are a challenge. I had to wait sometime for the hotel to get me one. However when I was at Shangri-la (for lunch) they seem to a couple of taxis already on standby. I guess the difference in price do show.
- Provided towels in the room are bare minimum, ie 2 towels for 2 guests for showering. 5 star hotels usually provide separate towels per guest for washing of face, additional shower towels sometimes etc. In a way I supposed its more green ..
- Wife could not find the hair dryer in the room so likely housekeeping forgot about it. When we had it sent up, it did not work...
- 2 very small bottles of water to last your day. Keep in mind there is no gift shop/convenient store on hotel grounds that you can purchase bottled water.",5.0,2023-02-17T16:06:27+07:00

 Dear all

I would like to write you this e-mail, to share with you my disappointment regarding my stay in your hotel.

First of all, I want to let you know that we are travelling for the last 28 days as we are honeymooners and we visit more 3 continent and more than 8 cities and hotels and this was our unique misadventure.

We checked in on Feb 6th and our room was great but without a view nor a balcony and despite of the fact that I informed the hotel that we are honeymooners, you just did a bed decoration upon request on the second day. 
We kindly asked the reception to move us to a room with a balcony and they find us a king size bed room with a view but it would be better if not.

Our room now is 3410 and is way downgraded compared to the 2505.
The bathroom floor is wet since yesterday night and in some places dirty, the walls are wet also because of the humidity, and on the top of it the pillow smells moisture and the towels are extremely used.

My wife is allergic, spent a horrible night, and this is really irritating.

I strongly recommend you send your team to the room to acknowledge how critical the situation is.

 Infinity pool was really beautiful, overlooking the ocean. There are sufficient daybeds for the number of guests in the hotel and lots of other lounging areas around that overlook the ocean. Rooms are also well furnished, beds are really comfortable with bathtub for use.
 Hot water in the room isn't hot at all, showers at night were really cold.

Food - service is slow, at the sunset bar, food takes 20-30 mins to serve even when its not crowded. Quality of food across all the restaurants in the hotel also leaves more to be desired. For the amount they are charging, I think they can do a much better job with the food - pasta, korean dishes, thai dishes were all lacking. Only the burger was decent

Service - service in general is inconsistent. Some staff were really friendly and welcoming, but some weren't very helpful. I left my Fitbit watch in the spa on the last day and only realised when I was at the airport. Managed to contact them after a lot of hassle and they promised over the call to reach out to me thru WhatsApp after I hung up, but after almost 24hours, I'm back in my home country and I haven't received any replies to my messages or email. I'm hoping they will get in touch about my watch, and if they do, I'll edit this review accordingly. But for now, a little disappointed in their service and help.",6.0,2023-01-31T12:12:11+07:00

 we paid a very high fee due to the holiday season and I feel like it was overall overpriced, especially when we had to extend our stay due to flight cancellations (on account of what happened at Manila airport)
The hotel is not ready for the rush - food comes out slowly in all the restaurants, reception has long lines, at breakfast they're not able to keep up with the rush.  Not much selection compared to another hotel we stayed at in Cebu.

 Clean.

Liked the front desk when we checked in, just trace who did that in our records.
 Humiliation In Sunset bar started after occupying a table for 15 min and started ordering ala carte my family was asked to moved out because waiter and Manager told us they cater only to Buffet clients. In full view of other clients.  They should have put a sign at the access areas that its only for Buffet clients OR they cordoned off a place specifically for ala carte only and/or Buffet only.

We were asked to move to The view.  Imagine eating Family Dinner meal crouching because  table and chairs were not dining tables and dining chairs.

Earlier on, Food served especially the Baby back ribs were tough and tastes sub par.  You cannot say ""compliments to the Chef""..  Food taste doesnt match with what to expect for a world renowned Hotel.

TAKING a bath inside the room posed a problem as the water leaked outside the perimeter of the bath area onto the Toilet bowl area. Must be because of the flat design of the floor.

 We did not like property, we came from 11 hour flight and we arrived in the hotel at 2AM in the morning to relax. When we arrived in the room, there was foul smell and when we checked, there was molds all over the curtian. 
We immediately request to change room and it was already 4AM and we did not have sleep.  In the other room we were not able also to relax as the whole room (floor, wall, mirror, cabinets) is wet of moisture. Even our stuff is wet - luggage, shoes, including the furnitures and our comforter. 
What is worst was, we almost slide in the toilet because of moist in the floor and in the morning we have colds and cough due to moist, three of us my wife and my child. It is very unusual experience we had and very bad one. I was not convinced with their explaination as I have experience in the industry.

 I enjoyed infinity pool, grand luxury ambience of entire hotel, spacious, clean, relaxing & luxurious  atmosphere, the luxurious amenities, comfy luxurious beds
 During this trip - the room i reserved was not available upon check-in .... and staff did not inform us that room was not available  - staff simply put us into whatever room was vacant ... i had to put a lot of request  and back and forth to get the type i reserved ... staff soon put us into a suite room .... but told us 2 reservations will now have to stay in 1 suite having 2 rooms & bath ....

This did not work for us, as the point of having 3 separate reserved rooms was to have each of our privacy .... i had to escalate and and after close to 3 hrs of discussions ... staff agreed to maintain our 3 separate room reservations - the wrong type of room was upgraded to a suite 

By the time we were able to check-in and unpack luggages ... it was after 7pm .... check-in was at 4pm .... that meant ... we (7 people/ 2 families) were waiting in 1 room while staff figured out how to resolve ...

Note - that one of the 2 in-house restaurants was scheduled to close at 9pm ..... and it took 45 mins. to have all our ordered meals arrive ...

 The room was lovely, clean and very comfortable. The pools were beautiful, clean and a good temperature. The staff were generally good. The food overall was good, particularly good in the thai restaurant. It was nice to sit at the sunset bar and watch the sunset. The facial in the spa by Neri was absolutely amazing. The spa is particularly luxurious and it was very easy to get a booking. 
Staff that were especially amazing include Lovely at the Deli, Gabriel at the front desk, and Jahil and Tina at the sports bar.
 There was a lot of construction going on, which meant the main lobby bar was basically unusable. Unfortunately there is a big tanker that sits right in front of the sunset, so we didn't get the sunset views we were hoping for. I'm not sure if it is because it was low season, but the only food options were the sports bar and the thai restaurant. The service was inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad. The soundproofing in the rooms was not very good at all, I could hear the next room watching tv and even their 6am alarm. There is also no store to buy additional items, which is difficult as the hotel is at least 2km away from the nearest 7/11.",7.0,2022-11-29T00:42:25+07:00

- They have flyer that there is free shuttle bus to Nustar resort and casino, but when I booked it, they said it`s not available on weekdays. If like that, you should make better advertisement.

Thai restaurant on the 2nd floor served delicious dishes with fresh ingredients. Bar on the ground floor also served good Filipino dishes. They also have really good breakfast. Though I missed it, I heard they serve taho (silken tofu) during the weekends in a very traditional Filipino way of serving i.e., with a vendor carrying taho containers on a bamboo pole on his shoulder and yelling ""taho!

 Nothing much really. If there's one thing worth mentioning, that would probably be the attentiveness of the reception staff.
 This resort is overrated compared to other 5-star facilities in Mactan (e.g. Shangrila, Plantation Bay and Solea). Nothing is special about it except for the bigger pool that they boast about. The rooms are poorly maintained (toilet walls not wiped clean, bathroom doors and wardrobes are not in good condition - I couldn't close my bathroom door at all!). Pillows are not comfortable enough and had some pungent smell (smells like urine) on them. The food they serve (via room service) are super expensive but not really tasty. The room partitions are not sound-proofed and I was awaken few times during the night due to loud banging from the other rooms nearby.

 Didn't take breakfast... wanted to leave.
 It already started bad, during check in.. requested a extra bed during booking. During check in said was an extra 2k PHP. So said on website state, kid until 13 is free of charge. Then there was suddenly no upcast anymore, but needed to pay for breakfast. Okay no problem... So I said, why do you not ask before making any comment.. or check her passport yourself. So I asked, is the extra bed in the room or not.. she said no... Finally when to the room, guess what.. the extra bed was there. Only the extra towel wasn't. So when going for dinner, passed by the reception, and said.. well your info is not correct, the extra bed is there, only one towel missing. Her comment.. maybe they did do that during check in.. I said you are really funny ;-). 

Dinner in the 'The view"".. well that's another story... Ordered food. A chicken Soup, which was the highlight of the stay, as the simply was really nice and good. Unfortunately needed to ask after ± half hour when my food would be served, but first needed to catch the attention of at least 7 people staff, who were having a great time together chatting and laughing but not paying attention to the few tables. My food was served... but when ingredients are present which you do not eat, which are not specified on the menu, is not helpful. 

The fact that there are works, due to the typhoon Odette is normal and they try to minimize. The fact that a big ship broke loose during the typhoon and now is within ocean view scenery is bad luck for them... so I suggest, look left on your balcony.

The best part and smoothest one, was my request earlier checkout. That was smooth, quick, efficient and friendly. First time they performed up to the standards, and of which I am thankful how they did handle and process.

Maybe I faced all the bad luck during my stay... but simple management and staff training can make these issues all disappear.",2.0,2022-07-19T12:01:56+07:00

 The hotel is understaffed which needs to be addressed by senior management. It was very difficult to get served by the pool and often a room service call would go unanswered.

Staff was friendly and helpful, but somewhat incompetent as well. See below.
 Communication and operational problems: Housekeeping not making up room as requested. 
Pool guard demanding 1000 pesos in front of visiting god-child for swimming in pool. If this was hotel policy it should have been disclosed when checking in—not in front of our visiting guest. 
Credit card charges billed in USD instead of pesos as requested. 
Tried to charge our 9 yo for breakfast which was included in the booking.com listing.

 Really disappointed with the property. We were put in building three where we were met with a very damp smell as soon as we entered the building and our room. Once we lay on the bed it was evident that the bed and bedding was also damp. We complained to reception who told us they had no rooms in another building but could move us to a new room in the same building. So we agreed which smelled lovely but left for dinner for a few hours and upon returning to the room we were met with the same damp smell. It was clear to us that the staff had just sprayed the room with air freshener. We complained once again and magically they had a room for us in the other building.

People who are sensitive to sound when sleeping. A sound like raindrops falling on an iron roof came from the vents and disturbed my sleep.

In addition, there are many places where the paint is peeling off or the facilities are being repaired, so the aesthetics are not good.

 We came for a relaxing two days at the end of travelling but unfortunately wasn’t what we expected. we arrived and much of my groups rooms smelled of damp and the beds were damp. this was probably as a result of the typhoon but if that is the case you should not open these rooms to guests. there was a lovely tv but it did not connect to phones as they do not have it set up correctly so the tv was wasted. the sunset bar service wasn’t very good. they mixed up all our orders a number of times, charged us the wrong amount and took ages for food and drink. the pittas and wraps were a disgracefully small size, they are not worth it!

 Absolutely amazingly friendly and helpful staff! Great pools. Nice and modern rooms.
 They didn't clean our rooms every day, which is simply not acceptable for a hotel that claims to have 5 stars. The usual fitness center is currently closed, and the temporary one lacks a treadmill and has no Wi-Fi
connectivity! The information on the booking site should be much more explicit on what services are closed due to the typhoon (e.g. one of the beaches, the fitness center, etc.) so that people don't feel fooled.",7.0,2022-04-02T20:50:43+07:00

 I booked this for my Auntie as her birthday present. She said, it was a comfortable stay.  Had fun times at the swimming pool during the day. Staff are friendly and accommodating.
 No more lights outside at night. wanted to go down and walk around pool area but so dark. There was before the last time we stayed.

A complimentary birthday slice cake was not edible had to throw in the bin. My Auntie was not happy about it (should not be given instead if it’s off, it’s not right!)

 The TV in room and movies option was good. Some of the staff we friendly and some could work on being friendly.
 False advertise, there was no fitness centre, even though was stated that it was available on website. Spa room unavailable but only option was to be done on bed which was not ideal. Bufet was not best and food cold, was off putting. To much yellow caution tape around and put me off a bit. Noise in night, think construction and you can hear through walls quite easily and hallways.

Restaurants all serve the same menu, that was rediculous for the price to stay at resort and food was quite expensive I find for what I was getting. 

There was no house keeping for rooms unless you called for it to be service. Was not told on arrival but to find out when I saw a room being attented to. They said you need to call to prebook and it is due to pandemic. I was like really, or was it to minimise on cost. 

Was annoying to always call house keeping or hopefully catch someone in hall way if you cannot reach them. 

There was no Managment on site to talk to at all, no Duty Manager. Reception can only listen and help as far. 

Beach closes at 5pm, was told no life guards around that time, pool closes at 8pm even though it is 4 foot pool all around. Was told is to service the pool but there are guest who are not kids are would like to enjoy the pool a little later than earlier.

Kids are in same pool as adults, a little noisy. Would of liked to enjoy a little peace and quiet by the pool and not kids running up and down.

 The property is beautiful.  Just a renovation work in progress, since they’ve been hit badly by typhoon Odette.  It was a busy weekend, being a long one since it was a holiday in Cebu.  Service is wonderful.  Restaurant for dinner was at the Sunset cafe temporarily, since the typhoon, so not all items on buffet needing warmers had it, so some were cold.  My table reservation was given to somebody, disappointing, but accommodated with my demand to be given what was available/reserved for a different group who didn’t arrive.  They were busy, and staff still coping…needing improvement, but staff are all kind and hospitable.  Beautiful rooms, beautiful design of resort, well planned for the property they have in Mactan Cebu.  White sand beaches is not something to expect in Mactan Cebu, just an fyi.  But being by the sea is still calming and relaxing, and they have a nice huge pool.  Still a good relaxing stay over all.  I would come back.
