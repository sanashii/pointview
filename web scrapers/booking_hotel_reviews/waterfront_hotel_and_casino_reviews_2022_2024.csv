 Staff was really nice & respectful. Most of the facilities are well-maintained considering that it’s already more than 30 yrs. old. Location is walking distance to IT Park, Ayala Mall, etc.
 Traffic is really horrible especially during peak hours & heavy rain. So, time management with whatever you plan for the day is important. Booking.com price is too expensive compared to directly booking in the hotel webpage. We’re trying to negotiate when we’re there, but booking.com wasn’t helping.

The swimming pool and gym were great as well.
 The swimming pool cascades  were not operational when we were there due to it being closed off for safety reasons, no doubt for future repairs to be  carried out. 
Not having a separate queue at the reception desk for checking- out as check- in and check- out were in the same queue taking longer to get attended to.

 Rooms are very clean and always well presented.  The Italian Restaurant La Gondola is very good, the staff are excellent and always polite and professional.  Their food is always well presented and they do theoir best to make the food as authentic as possible.  Their Pizzas are particularly good as are the desserts.
 Staff can be very helpful, but ocassionally the check-in staff can be a bit short and dismissive.   I sent an email to the Hotel informing them that my fiance would be arriving around three hours before me and that they should let her into the room.  She ended up having to explain all sorts of things to the check-in staff to be able to get into the room when she arrived.  Then they gave her a lower grade room.  When I arrived the young lady on the front desk resolved the issue very quickly, but as I had been travelling for 26 hours I was a but frustrated and annoyed to say the least.",7.0,2024-03-09T14:10:21+07:00

 There were only 2 people on board during checkout time. So many people in the queue. They should separate check out from check in. Not fair to wait half an hour just to surrender key cards. Someone should be dedicated to accept key cards.

 The room smelled musty, we wanted one bed, but they gave us two single beds pushed together. They literally just pushed together, obviously, there was a gap in between so it's still like sleeping on a separate single bed. We thought that they would at least modify the bedding and the linens. Speaking of beddings and linens, they had this old, mostly, mouldy smell. The toilet was clogged after one use, the THERMOSTAT WAS BROKEN. It was 11 degrees in the room when we woke up after our first night. We left the hotel slightly under the weather because of the irregular and dysfunctional thermostat. The floors and even the carpet were sticky. We can hear the people from across the room and they weren't even being loud. They were just having a normal conversation but we can still hear them. There were NO ISSUES with the staff, just with the actual facility and hotel itself.",1.0,2023-11-07T17:15:11+07:00

 The rooms were very clean and spacious. They are a bit out dated but the hospitality and amenities definitely make up for it. The beds are quite comfortable and the AC was able to keep our room at a decent temperature. The Wi-Fi though could use some work. The signal was very spotty. It was either too weak to connect or not strong enough to keep a stable connection. At one point I just started using my data because I got frustrated with the constant disconnects. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when we asked questions, always smiling and greeting us when passing in the halls or lobby. Check in did take longer than usual as there was only one receptionist, we arrived around 7PM, but when we checked out a few days later there were 3 people working front desk. The pool area is HUGE and there is a life guard on duty, good idea since the main pool is quite deep right from the start. I'm 5'6"" and  couldn't touch in the centre. There is a kiddie pool separate from the main pool as well. The hotel offers swimming lessons for kids which was really nice to see. Unfortunately the waterfall was under construction but the outdoor area was still beautiful and we enjoyed our afternoon there. There were plenty of loungers and seating available around the pool so finding a close seat was never an issue. 
In the mornings there is an outdoor space, same area as the pool, to enjoy yoga and the gym was one of the nicest ones I have seen in any hotel (or some gyms even!). There is room service, avail 24 hours, and a few restaurants on site. However they were a little over priced so we opted to eat out or have delivery. We don't gamble so we never bothered to check out the casino side but it looked quite popular. At the main entrance there is security and a dog on site to ensure the guests safety. 
We had such a relaxing vacation and a great time visiting the city. Highly recommend staying here if you get the chance.

If they are going to do this.  When I checked in I asked about the  extra charge. The front desk said they had to call their credit card processing company and manually cancel it and suggested I dispute the charge. This is at check in I'm being told to dispute a charge.

 Nice ambience, lobby and building. Good AC, warm water, but no shower handle. Ok morning robe and slippers, but you have to ask for it.
 Worn down, elevators don't show if they go up or down(!), pool area still under renovation after several years.
Breakfast don't even have decent bread, warm food is of the cheapest kind and they us the smallest glasses (like in budget hotels).
No more valet parking and parking garage is a disaster. You have to walk quite far and then drive down several levels just to get out and they demand payment to leave, if you don't have a validation slip (like in cheap hotels). Too much hassle. Parking outside the lobby too strict, considering the inconvenient and time-consuming garage,
Casino worn down, no bar or decent drink service, very few games. They didn't even have Black Jack or Roulette (last on request and therefore mostly empty).

 Its an okay stay for me. I was expecting better room design but I guess since this is an old hotel. So the design of the room is already old compared to newer hotels. I did not see a mini bar though. breakfast was at 500 per person and I was told that its 750 or was it 800 if I will just go directly during breakfast and pay at their restaurant. So I took their promo and well, the breakfast was just ok. its not that great. but its not also bad. we went during Holy Week, we check in for 1 day during Friday and check out Saturday. I thought their casino would be available but unfortunately its Friday and Saturday. I choose this hotel thinking that they are operating their casino during Holy week. But unfortunately it was not.
 When I first entered their room. I did not like the smell. I guess its their air freshener that they used. its just does not smell nice. Its a little strong and kind of confusing. its like an old smell.",7.0,2023-06-06T19:39:12+07:00

 This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Service is exceptional, we had to leave super early for a 6am flight, I had accidentally booked this hotel thinking it was the one in front of the airport, although they weren't able to switch my bookings they more than happy to find us a taxi to pick us up early in the morning. Hot water, bed was decent. I was unable to use any of the good amenities that I saw, since our flight was so early. I saw a casino and I believe I saw they had a bar, room service, though more on the expensive side, had a lot of options and is 24 hours when I was there.
 There is a limited amount of plugs in our room, though it's not a big upset, it was still a little inconvenient. There is quite a big step to simply get in the shower, I did find it a little strange. A big upset that there are two waterfront hotels. This one, and the one right next to the airport, and unfortunately I wasn't able to cancel my reservation without a fee, though it is my fault for not paying attention.",9.0,2023-06-03T18:17:16+07:00

 The on-site registration/rebooking. The room and the room maiden. The Breakfast. The hotel included restaurants. The Hall for our venue. The cocktails. The experience and the appearance. Elevators: Fast and big.
 The online registration. If  i am the manager, i would fire the responsible persons. I could not book the whole needed time online because of a voucher. I could only book the voucher-attached times. So, i ask by email before to extend my booking. No answer. So i extend the needed day by booking.com and ask for connecting the bookings to use the same room. First Answer: No Problem. Second Answer: Not possible. I was already really pissed off by the waterfront hotel! But the on-side desk corrects anything. No problem, Sir! This changed my mindset for the Waterfront.
The Pool is already very overused and need urgent renovation. Some places there smell like septic tank, the Waterfall is not working anymore and looks like a ruin.",10.0,2023-05-08T13:41:14+07:00

 Everything from the front door till to the front desk was super. The front desk meet all our expectations, always helpful and friendly. The room and stay overall was super and everything is worth, you get what you pay for.
 For dinner we didn't try the dinner buffet because we were not hungry enough so we decided to order Ala Card. The food in the Uno restaurant is very delicous and the stuff are very friendly as always but how can you forget the plates. But how can it happen that the dimner will be served but nobody noticed that we do not have any plates. How are we supposed ti eat it. So we gave the restaurant another try at the next day during the breakfast buffet. The choices are great, stuff were very helpful and food again was very delicous. Unfortunately, the stuffs are a little bit disorganized and the stuff who guide you to your table are not aware which customers were first in the line, so it happened that other customers after us were served first. If you finished your plate they will directly try to get the old plates which is ok but please stop asking customer if you can have the other plate which is under your current plate while you are still eating. That's annoying and rude. Ask for empty used plates which are besode but not the one under your current plate while you are still eating. But overall it is apways a good choice toeat there.

 Only the lobby
 Check-in took forever and it was inaccurate. Booked for 1 adult and 1 child and only reflected as one adult and was told I have to pay for breakfast for my child. 

The hotel upgraded me but actually it was actually a downgrade. The Ambassador room was dated and my initial room had a double bed but was given twin beds. Beds were uncomfortable and one of the twin beds was already leaning on the side.

The elevator also had a mind of its own thus being on 18th floor did not help. On the outside of the elevator, there was no indication which direction it was going - either up or down. 

The bathtub certainly needs to be uprooted and replaced. All chipped in so many places and the temporary remedies they made kept floating whilst having a bath. Missing shower cap on amenities and had to request for this. The room was also only provided one toilet tissue so this was also again being requested. 

The room was however clean and of ample size. The view was absolutely rubbish during the day since you then overlooked some deprived areas of the area. The room lacked charging sockets too. 

Disappointing breakfast to say the least and certainly wasn't worth what they were charging. 

Check out was exactly the same as check in that took forever.

The hotel's parking area also smells and is dirty. 

Thank goodness the staff were brilliant with an exception of the Front desk / reception staff who I feel deserve more training and in my opinion were not very good at what they do. 

Overall, not coming back to this hotel and will certainly not be recommending this to family, friends and business colleagues.",3.0,2022-08-15T19:05:01+07:00

 They have great facilities including some nice restaurants, a casino, separate kids and adult pools, and the best hotel gym I have ever seen. The gym had a cross fit training area, a boxing ring and one of those air aerobics rooms where people hang from curtains. You would never know this as there is absolutely no marketing to guests at check in or in the rooms. Maybe that’s why the restaurants are empty. 
The staff was consistently gracious and super friendly. Requests for maintenance and laundry pick up were prompt and professional. 
Kudos go to the front desk manager who, unlike her colleagues, jumped in to assist when there was a long line. Also the sales department who booked one group after another, keeping the property full. Maybe they can apply their talents to some in house marketing
 What bothered me was the overall lack of management presence, supervision, and training of staff. This extended to fine dining mechanics and timing, to housekeeping details, and attention to the breakfast buffet. 
For example, there was a huge line at the egg station. If the manager checked, he would have seen that a cook who was trying to help the woman at the egg station was instead getting in her way. He kept invading her space and breaking her rhythm. If I was managing a restaurant in town I would hire that woman and double her salary without hesitation. An outstanding employee by any measure. Seeing her being disrespected that way was upsetting to watch.",7.0,2022-07-31T07:07:59+07:00

 First, as we went into the hotel we were impressed with the  entrance and the beauty of the place but as we went into the elevator, we noticed a foul musty odor. Not sure if it was the carpet with moisture or what but it smelled almost like moldy musty odor. As we we t into the room, we liked the view and the suite but odor was still in the room and it was hot and muggy in which I could not sleep. I called the front seat in which they sent an engineer up abs said there was nothing they can do as the AC was centralized and they had an issue with the AC. End of story.

Polite, happy, and friendly staff, and at least for a hotel in Cebu, amazingly quiet. Food menu is awesome.
