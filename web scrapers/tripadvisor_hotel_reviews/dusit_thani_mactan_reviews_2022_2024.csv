Would recommend others to stay here. Here you get a lot of experience for the price.  Memory for life.",5,2024-07-09
958331039,"When visiting Dusit Thani for the first time, the #1 thing I noticed is that the ambiance of the place is very relaxing, even the kids really enjoy swimming in the pools and sea. The food is highly palatable especially the Japanese food for its savory, mouth watering flavor that made us want  to come back for more. Thank you to the great Chef Mikhael Loven Apura for our amazing dining experience. You prepared a unique and healthy dish, highly commendable. We had so much fun and we are planning to go back soon.",5,2024-07-07

The combination of luxurious accommodations, exquisite dining, superb facilities, and outstanding service makes it a destination I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a memorable and relaxing getaway. I can't wait to return and experience this slice of paradise once again. We greatly appreciate the staff, with special thanks to Kris for his exceptional hospitality and outstanding service.

958328055,"We have stayed at Dusit Thani (2nd time)  with local family and from overseas and booked 3 rooms (2 executive, 1 seaview) and have availed the Gala Dinner for 7 pax. We  have extended our stay for  another 5-6 days again for 3 rooms. 
Over all, we had few issues here and there, the unfair rule for using of pool for an hr for 3 guests, our guests that were waiting for our booked dinner for 12 pax , our stay wasn‚Äôt the best and smooth as we expected, but luckily  MS. Jovelyn Zulueta has helped us a lot. She was there in almost everything, every concern we had, from  buffet to reception or anywhere we needed her. Even I lost my iphone charger from moving 1 room to another and she returned it to me safely packed and tidy. She had an absolute best performance that we could not thank her enough. We made sure we all have checked out from the hotel all good, spent more time with the local family, and flew back to Australia  safe and sound.
I just had this oppotunity to write this review and proud to mention, this good compliment is mainly for her. Again thank you heaps to Jovelyn, her help and assistance have made our stay at Dusit Thani  a better one!",3,2024-07-07

957623470,"Amazing views as you enter the hotel 
Great breakfast selection but coffee was so so 
Rooms are spacious and beds are comfy. 
Had a Very good Thai restaurant 
The beach wasn‚Äôt accessible during our stay but pool side views made up for it. 
It‚Äôs far from the main road so you need a grab or car to navigate locally. 
But as always the hospitality is top notch 
I won‚Äôt hesitate to stay again .",4,2024-07-02
957450506,"Our first visit to Dusit Thani Mactan and it was truly a pleasure.our room had a fantastic view of the water. The bath was large and modern. The bed was comfortable and the bedding first rate.

The best part of the hotel was the staff who were exceptional from the very beginning. I want to particularly call out Lei at the lobby bar, he was professional, friendly, and efficient. Leo made our experience outstanding. 

The pool is enormous and beautifully laid out. We also really enjoyed walking the grounds below the pool where they have ample seating to look out over the water, volleyball and badminton. It‚Äôs a great place for a morning or evening stroll.

We were busy most days enjoying the hotel, so ordered room service for dinner. It arrived promptly and the food was good. I appreciated that room service was available via a QR code on the menu. They also had housekeeping, amenity requests, concierge etc. available via this code. We actually used it to order a hotel car to take us back into the city when our stay was over. 

Thanks to all of the staff at Dusit Thani for a wonderful experience",5,2024-06-30

956897486,"Dear Dusit Thani Mactan Team

First I would like to say a sincere THANK YOU to your GM Sir Laurent and to Ms Cling of Marketing for arranging this opportunity to experience your warm and gracious hospitality. We were extremely satisfied with the warm service given to us during our stay.  We loved our sea view room overlooking your huge pool and the views are so stunning both daytime and evening. We were amazed at the birthday sweets and treat that welcomed us in our room upon arrival. Special thanks to Chef for creating such delicious dessert. As a former hotelier, I must say that your hospitality and level of customer service is far exceeding my expectation of your five star resort. Your staff were so friendly and helpful when we went swimming and enjoying your Deli Cafe sweets. Breakfast experience was superb with such an extensive selection of breakfast fares. So yummy. So much we wanted to do and experience in Dusit Thani and definitely we will consider your resort as our preferred destination for us and our guests. My nephew from manila is a regular stayer in your lovely hotel. Kudos and wish you well and more awards now and in future. All the best and kind wishes to your team.

No where in the world can you find the hospitality and warmth that emanate so naturally from the Filipino people. And this is across the board in all areas of the hotel.

954620392,"The Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu is a lovely hotel. On arrival we were upgraded to a sea view which was unexpected and a really lovely touch. 
The room is huge and has everything you need, it includes both UK and US plug sockets. Modern and well kept. Complimentary water every day. 
June has been a good time to visit as it‚Äôs not very busy meaning sun beds are readily available any time of day. 

Pool is large
Cocktails are delicious 
Lovely cafe serving coffee, frappes, pastries and ice cream.
Sports bar with pool, table football etc tvs and food. Karaoke in the evenings which is a Philippino favourite. 

The staff are really lovely and welcoming with a friendly smile and are always happy to help. We want to particularly praise our new friend Leo on the main bar, who has been a delight and lovely to chat with. His cocktails were always made with care and tasted fantastic. 

We wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to stay in this hotel again. The Philippines is a really lovely destination to experience.

952823497,"We had a most wonderful stay. 6 out of 5 stars. 

One of the most perfect vacations we ever had. Thank you to Karen for the warm welcome and for going over and beyond what we expected. Our room was truly 5 star with sheets, pillows and a bed that smelled of freshly washed linens. Felt like sleeping in clouds. Our room faced the water- end to end. A view that was breathtaking as it was serene and soulful. I would go here again for this view. There was no sunset view bec it was a cloudy day. Nevertheless the view was majestic and stunning.

I don‚Äôt like swimming in public pools but Dusit‚Äôs stunning pool beckoned and I‚Äôm glad I went ahead bec the water was as it should be. I could do laps without goggles and not going half blind from chlorine. There was no chlorine smell in fact but water was clear and clean and so inviting. Don‚Äôt miss it like I almost did. 

I also don‚Äôt enjoy buffets too much but I‚Äôm glad my husband and I did the Seafood Market buffet for dinner. It must have been one of the best buffets in my life. The staff in Dusit were warm- from Karen to Leo to Kris. Not too much the chubby gay guy who dances the tinikling and pretended he didn‚Äôt know I wanted to try it out and had a dance concert to himself. A small annoyance that hasn‚Äôt marred our stay there. 

The free ride to Nustar was a superb add on. Thank you Dusit Cebu for a most magical time you gave me and my husband. We will be back with our kids. 

PS  I hope Dusit engages the community it finds itself in and that it becomes a force for social justice and progress. Specifically I hope you allow the families who fish for food in the beach area to do so without having your security guards tell them off. I hope Dusit closes the obscene gap between those who have too much and those who have way too little in your own way. Thank you.",5,2024-05-29
952811729,Excellent housekeeping. Value employee Joey and Xiao. They have a great personality and my room was so cleaned. I am looking forward to meet them again when I come back here in Cebu. I highly recommend them to other guest in this beautiful hotel. Gracias!,5,2024-05-29
952809372,"Dusit was an amazing stay as I went here for 2 nights alongside my partner. Firstly I'd like to shoutout Ruth, Zee and Leo for their amazing service, they were so welcoming, kind and showed fantastic customer service throughout our stay.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun. 

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience. 

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep. The bathroom and balcony areas were also really nice and clean. 

Overall Dusit deserves its 5/5 rating and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would come back to relax here in a heartbeat.",5,2024-05-28

951703721,"The hotel is aesthetically pleasing. A nice decent family room for 6, a massive pool & offers aquatic zumba before sunset, a great breakfast selection & a delicious afternoon te offer. 

But these are the things we are disappointed & frustateted about: the unlimited drinks they suggested to us to pay extra to have an ¬´unlimited¬ª  access drinks ( alcoholic drinks not included) is not worth  the 1,400 per person. We were there at 11 am and the fruits shakes were not availble already. We booked days before for a 12 nn lunch at their sunset day bar restaurant but the last order for the crispy pata is already closed? Like what?  Really? Cant believe it. Just sat down and we cant order whats in the menu. This bar restaurant is  super hot, not lucky if you seated on a table without a fan above , loud , noisy , not enough ventilation. We waited long for our food. The Surf & Turf platter is not worth its price & honestly not that good. Letchon kawali pica pica is ok. 

Then we decided to use its pool, but we werent allowed to use our unlimited drinks access at the pool, they wanted us to order our drinks from the sunset bar, because the access is only at the view lounge infront of the bar because the pool is in front of the bar restautant & its not allowed. so Whats the point of paying the unlimited access then? But then foreigners were allowed.  So we ended up talking to a staff, and then finally allowed us . Why? 

Hotel staff at the view lounge & bar/restaurant werent pleasant to us generally as well. We may look not good but we are customers & we expected a just service especially in an international hotel brand. Never experienced this on other hotels yet. 

Kudos though to the Staffs at the breakfast lounge, entrance & room staffs.  They were very helpful, Nice & accomodating to our big family. Its suppose to be an international hotel brand but this branch must work on more on their (non bisaya staffs) . As for now i cant totally recommend for a big family and not be coming back for the moment. Thank you.",2,2024-05-21

949485909,"Wow Dusit Thani! We have stayed and many 5-Star resorts, but rarely see one so dedicated to visitor services and enjoyment as Dusit Thani!! We used Dusit Thani as a ‚Äúhub‚Äù for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.

One bad thing we must point out. We stayed one night in a Club Room in Building 3 and the entire building and room smelled of mildew and was too hot out to open the windows. Yuck! Not sure if this is a persistent problem or not, but bad enough for us to never stay in that building again.",5,2024-05-04

949431814,"Two nights into a 6 night stay. Let me begin by saying this review is from an Australian point of view which puts me in a minority in regard to guests. The hotel itself is lovely and offers a beautiful view, the staff are friendly and the pool is large. The resort is best suited to people who enjoy staying at the resort the entire time as there is nothing around the resort, no mini mart, no restaurants, no shopping‚Ä¶ Everything is a 10 minute drive away. The main things we struggled with staying at DT were:
-
No mini mart - it cost us $20 for 4 small cans of tonic water at the hotel. There is literally no where nearby to purchase water / supplies so you have to purchase at the hotel. 
-
The breakfast buffet although large caters mainly towards Asian guests.  I selected the baked beans (lukewarm) hash brown (still frozen in the middle) and a fried egg (that I had to wait 15 minutes for)
-
Drink service by the pool is slow, 2 beers will take anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes. Prices are high but then again I understand we are in a resort and prices are always going to be high. Staff are friendly but you have to get their attention otherwise you don‚Äôt get served.
-
No one informed us of what was happening around the resort- we had no idea if it was bbq night, dj night etc as there is no communication with guests.
-
Dusit Club. It served its purpose. Only downside was the cold meat and cheeses sitting directly under a light resulting in it all to sweat which wasn‚Äôt appealing and again, food was cold by the time it was served. Drinks are also very slow‚Ä¶ 
-
This is more about Cebu than the resort‚Ä¶..
Beach at Dusit Thani is pebbly so shoes are necessary.
Roosters next to resort are very noisy in the morning.
Good Restaurant/Bar options  appear limited unless you go to other resorts which you have to get a taxi too and of course pay resort prices.

Overall Dusit Thani is a lovely resort that I would recommend to traveler‚Äôs that are looking for a resort holiday destination. If you like somewhere close to everything this isn‚Äôt the place for you.

Cebu - People are very friendly but I found little else that would entice me back. Asia has a-lot of nicer places to explore.",3,2024-05-04

947959713,"We recently stayed at the Dusit Thani Cebu resort for one night as part of our honeymoon celebrations.

We cannot recommend the place enough, the staff and facilities are excellent. We paid for the club lounge package which included refillable afternoon tea, 2 hours of unlimited cocktails with a selection of snacks (sushi / pigs in blankets / dumplings etc.), and breakfast.

We were served by a lovely waitress named Zee who was unbelievably friendly and attentive.

The club lounge was well worth the price we paid (1450 php) and the hotel is fantastic. Would definitely recommend this place if staying in Cebu.",5,2024-04-23
947914902,"The staff as always are very good, this didn't seem like a Dusit Thani brand hotel however apart from the prices. 

The Rooms are okay with a nice sea view. 
The sunset sports bar is all wrong. There's nothing sporting about it apart from the staff wearing what looks like an unflattering newcastle football strip. 
This could be a much more romantic bar and probably should be located further down near the seaside. 
Don't bother with the regular barbecue evening down on the boardwalk. It is actually a buffet with some poor cuts of meat and few prawns and bits of fish which are actually barbecued. I expected to see rows of barbecue. The food is much fresher in the food court in mactan newtown then on this barbecue! 
The thai restaurant caters for people who don't really like thai food i think because there is very little spice. Maybe optimized for western customers. 

Breakfast is okay if you like pickled egg and dried fish and a lots of other unidentifiable korean and asian foods, but for a westerner you can just about get your hands on some toast and eggs. There is no bacon and overall not a great  breakfast unless you are as the majority here of course asian. 
Overall i don't think I will rush back to this hotel. 
On the positive side the cebu the beach is not bad.",3,2024-04-22

The staff all around were 5 stars but these two were extra special. The hotel is beautiful and well-maintained. There‚Äôs a beach if you want to go into the sea, but with a large infinity pool with incredible west facing views of Cebu and the sunset, we stayed at the pool all day. They had some fun animation mid-afternoon with some staff leading a dance that was easy for us in the pool to follow along and enjoy. And the sunset views with a nice cocktail in hand was a beautiful experience.

We got a chance to have dinner at the Sunset Sports Bar near the pool are, Sir Francis assisted us very well and he was so kind. I hope you can meet him during your visit too! And it is so nice that they have themed dinner menu every night. 

We had lunch at BENJARONG, their signature Thai restaurant. It was one of the best Restaurant experience that we had! Their waitresses are so nice, we forget their names but the service they provide are exceptional, the food is so delicious, so glad that we have tasted authentic Thai cuisine.

The breakfast that they offer at the Tradewinds Cafe is SUPERB! They have a lot of choices in different cuisines.

Ally Jemar, Zee, Kevin, Gerson and chefs Anne and Judy in particular in the Club Lounge Elegance were phenomenal in making our stay at the Dusit Thani great. Other then these particular staff, the stay was average and not as expected. The rooms were good but generally service was quite slow. 

The check in process was laborious and tiring, the last thing needed after a long flight. At meal times, you'd easily wait up to 45mins for food to be brought out in the Sports Lounge and it always seemed there was a disproportionate number of staff compared to the service being delivered. Twice we were told they were waiting for delivery of bananas / fries and I didn't have a single cold beer whilst here... It appears the Dusit Thani doesn't possess refrigerators.

944744126,"My husband and I had a great stay at Dusit Thani, Cebu. Following a couple of weeks travelling, the hotel and service was just what we needed in terms of relaxation.

The breakfast was extremely good with lots of choice and good quality. 

Our daily visits to the Dusit Club Lounge for High Tea and cocktails were lovely especially with the professional and great service from Ellyson, Jemar, Christine and Gerson. 

We had one slight issue with not being able to access the BBQ evening however this was acknowledged by the team. 

The pool was amazing and a great size, never felt overcrowded. 

All staff were extremely welcoming and polite which made for a great stay.",5,2024-04-01

944471383,"Still worth coming back here. Everything was perfect. Has a huge infinity pool with a perfect view of the beach and sunset. Has a private beach access where you can relax and chill. Has a play area where kids would definitely enjoy. Has a viewing deck and sports area for volleyball, badminton, table tennis to name a few. Has a wide selection of drinks/desserts at their in-house restos and as for food/main dishes, I find it a bit limited now compared to our previous visit. Has the most amazing staffs who always greet you with a smile and attentive to your requests (shout out to Angel of Sunset sports bar, superb service!). Our deluxe room has a comfy king sized bed to rest to after a tiring day exploring all their ammenities. Thanks Dusit Thani Mactan!",5,2024-03-30
944470306,"Unforgettable XP at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu

Rating: 5/5

My recent stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu was an absolute delight from start to finish. The room was not only spacious and elegantly designed, but it also boasted one of the fluffiest pillows I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of resting my head on.

However, the comfort didn‚Äôt end there. The resort‚Äôs beach and long pool area provided the perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation. Whether I was soaking up the sun on the pristine beach or lounging by the expansive pool, every moment was pure bliss.

After a day of leisurely activities, returning to my room felt like coming home to a sanctuary of comfort and tranquility. The plush bedding, coupled with the heavenly pillow, ensured a restful night‚Äôs sleep like no other.

Our lunch at Sunset Sports Bar, was unforgettable! Angel, our server, She was exceptional, Kudos to Her! We savored a delightful 5 cheese pizza and spicy Korean wings with hummus, each dish bursting with flavor.

In conclusion, if you‚Äôre looking for a luxurious stay with exceptional comfort, look no further than Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu. I can‚Äôt recommend it highly enough, especially for those seeking one of the fluffiest pillows imaginable.",5,2024-03-30

It has many restaurants, a cafe, a sports bar, a big infinity pool that's probably than olympic size, and another smaller pool which offers better privacy. The infinity pool is warm and clean. There are so many activities available - open mic, karaoke night, billiards, darts, zumba, gym - you can just stay there the whole time to unwind. The view from the room and sunset at the pool are breathtaking. Food is really good. Beds are comfortable. A safe and clean crib was provider by request. Best of all, the staff are so nice and friendly. We were welcomed with a dance performance. They were all so nice and accommodating throughout our stay.

When we arrived at the hotel in the evening around 7-8pm we were informed that our room isn‚Äôt available due to a problem, and we have to be moved to a different hotel in their preference. As a courtesy of giving us this kind of inconvenience they did not consider allowing us to pick the room and the hotel of our choice no option was  laid hat so ever. We weren‚Äôt even informed about the problem in the first place when they had ample of time to notify us since we arrived hours late from our check in time which is 3pm, this made us even wonder of how this could happened not informing us ahead of time when they already know our expected time of arrival. Very unprofessional, they could‚Äôve emailed or ring us at least as a courtesy. We‚Äôre not convinced enough with all the reasons, It‚Äôs more like they gave our room to the basketball players who checked in the same hotel. They moved us in a different hotel of their choice, an old hotel, not even a seaview that they‚Äôve promised.

942708383,"We spent an entire week at this is large, fortified resort with one of the largest swimming pools I've ever seen. The moment you step into the lobby, your breath is taken away by the ocean views framed by the columns and high ceiling. The attentive staff are beautifully dressed in traditional Thai dresses and various uniforms. The Deluxe Sea View King Room we had was smaller than I expected, but had the same magnificent views as the lobby - a great way to wake up each morning. The breakfast buffet had an abundant pan-Asian menu with various stations. We opted some mornings to just purchase greek yogurt at The Deli, which was delicious. Our favorite: The Dusit Club Lounge (thanks to Kevin) and the Benjarong Thai Restaurant  (thanks to Gin) - which is world class. The management was also very responsive to our requests and took very good care of us.  There are twice daily Zumba classes at the pool, theme nights in the Sunset Sports Bar and various events, so there's a bit of a party atmosphere. The resort is popular with families looking for children's activities and kiddie pool. The property is located almost at then tip of Punta Enga√±o, which is about 40-50 minutes from Island Center Mall or Cebu City Center.

Walls were too thin, could hear neighbor family. The breakfast buffet is huge, but can get crowded.  The Thai restaurant has a few excellent dishes (Tom kha gai, Mango sticky rice).  The Korean restaurant should be skipped entirely. Sports bar is fun and a good chill spot. The pool is beautiful and well-kept. The Club Lounge has a lovely afternoon tea set, but is otherwise a barren space that is under-utilized and unwelcoming. As noted by others, the location is remote, with bumpy and dirty access roads.

But I have to say one flaw about this Mactan Cebu Dusit is extremely humid in the hotel room and it seems there is air-con ventilation issue. Our room floor was very wet with humidity and the bathroom became very slippery. The room got extremely moldy smell and I could not breath well in the room. Luckily I booked for one night only. 
We tried to set the ""Heat"" function on the air-con before going out for dinner then the humid and watery on the floor were gone when we were back to the room after 2 hours. But the moldy smell was still there.

936701036,"After spending 6 nights in this resort, we left, unfortunately, not too satisfied. The hotel has a beautiful atrium, the swimming pool is immaculately maintained, and the staff is extremely friendly and always ready to help. And that is what we would praise without reservation. Breakfast is rich in choice, but it is recommended to arrive as early as possible because after 8 o'clock the breakfast room gets very crowded and there are no free tables available.
The room (deluxe sea view) was clean, but it needs a complete renovation: the furniture has been corroded by time, the bathroom also cries out for a complete renovation, and the aircon was set to the minimum when we arrived, so we felt like we were in a refrigerator. When the aircon is not working, there is a stale smell in the room, but luckily we had pleasant weather, so we could air it out on the open balcony.
Beach practically does not exist.
¬†The location of the hotel is ideal for someone who does not want to move during their stay, but otherwise be sure to be aware that walking outside the resort is not recommended.
Luckily for us, we went on trips most of the time. 
 Always use only Grab! During our stay, we exclusively used Grab, but when checking out, the staff near the reception kindly offered to order us a taxi. Big mistake, our mistake for naively accepting it. Instead of the approx. 300 php we paid for Grab from the airport to the Dusit Thani, on departure, from Dusit Thani to the airport, we paid double! For the same way! It's a shame for the hotel that they hire a taxi driver as their co-worker, who complains all the way that he has five children, how it's his birthday today and that he has no money, and at the end, when he brought us to the airport, he asks us how much we're willing to pay him!? ! We offered him 500 php just to get rid of him as soon as possible but he also demanded 100 php for taxi ordering services for Dusit Thani hotel staff. It's terrible, really terrible that the hotel management tolerates such a thing and certainly knows about it.
¬†On the resort's website, it is stated that money can be changed at the reception, but it is not stated that they only change US dollars. They not exchange euros. This can be very annoying if you don't have enough pesos for a taxi to the nearest exchange office.
¬†All in all, this is far from the luxury resort they advertise.",2,2024-02-03
936503930,"We stayed for 5 nights. This was the first out of 4 hotels we stayed at whilst in the Phillipines. 
Pros
Emails before travel all answered promptly. 
All the staff (and there are lots of staff) are brilliant.
Very well looked after clean hotel.
Close to the airport and hotel arranged transfer.
Fast check in.
Location is beautiful. Sea facing room is a must.
Bed and room large. Bed was very comfortable.
The lounge is a nice touch with nibbles and cocktails and high tea included in club room prices.
Concierge will arrange trips for you. The cocktails where awesome and made correctly (the next hotel I travelled to didn't have a clue how to make cocktails), well done for awesome margarita's and Singapore slings. The red wine was nice at the club lounge. 
Everything you could possibly need in the room, including iron, ironing board, umbrella, scales, hair dryer, large fridge, extra duvet, toothbrushes, robes, slippers and toiletries etc and lots of storage space. The shower pressure is excellent.
Breakfast is excellent with lots of choice (it was the best we had while travelling in the Phillipines). Last walk in is 10.15am for breakfast, this not mentioned and witnessed one lady bring turned away, even though it wasn't 10.30.
A breakfast and coffee take out was offered when we went on an early morning trip (excellent service, other hotels did not offer this).
The pool is lovely with great views. Never had any issues with getting a sunbed.
The sports bar has free pool, darts, beer pong and fuse ball. 
The television wasn't working in our room, but we told our house keeping and this was immediately fixed by him.
The concierge, Jade, went above and beyond for us. He arranged our taxi to the port and even arranged our transfer from the port to the next hotel (we'd emailed our next hotel, but no reply).
The WiFi was good. 

Other
Nothing around hotel to walk to; but if you want to venture out a taxi can be called, experiences/trips arranged or there's a free shuttle (we didn't use the shuttle). 
The club longue ran out of both red and sparkling wine on separate occasions.
The condensation in the room makes the floors slippy. There is some advice regarding¬† keeping the balcony door closed to help with this in the room. We put towels on the floor when it was needed. 
The only improvement for a 5 star plus review would be, to be greeted with cold face towels and a complementary drink on arrival. 

Overall
If I was coming back to Cebu I would stay here again to rest after a long flight and before my onward journey, but I would need a club sea facing room again. An excellent hotel with everything you could possibly need. 
This was by far the best hotel we stayed in while in the Philippines.",5,2024-02-01

Good restaurants especially the Thai where the food and service was excellent. Very noisy from adjoining room through adjoining door. Long wait at breakfast for omelettes would benefit from an extra chef at peak times.

Everything was perfect, but I had a great time thanks to Kevin, maica, and chef Rufa working in the club lounge.

935060854,"After COVID-19, I visited again and it was the worst because of the front desk.

The check-in documents are under someone else's name,
When I asked him to change it, he said it doesn't matter, but he changed it.

I'm a member of Dujit Gold, so what is ""Welcome Amenity""? He doesn't explain it and just says he's in the room, and when I went into the room, there was nothing like that.

My luggage didn't come, and I was tired of picking things up, so I just passed it over.

I've been waiting for my luggage for over 50 minutes.
I contacted the front desk because my luggage didn't come, and they said they'd bring it to me, but it hasn't come for more than 20 minutes since then, so I went to the front desk and brought it myself.

Apart from the bad impression of the front desk, everyone was kind and I loved it.",2,2024-01-22
934932969,"The Hotel is very spacious with beautiful views directly out to the sea from most areas. The staff were all super friendly with a smile and greeting all the time. Restaurants in the Hotel were excellent and food was really presented and tasty. Our room was really comfortable other than we only had one bedside table in a very large bedroom. The Buffet Breakfast was very good with plenty of things to choose from. The gym probably could do with some additional cardio equipment as there was only one treadmill which was out of service. The layout of the gym also perhaps could do with a rethink as it is all glass to obviously take advantage of the beautiful sea views whilst working out,  however when sun is so hot even in late evening it is like working out in a sauna. The location of the hotel meant that we had to get a taxi everywhere as there were no restaurants within walking distance. Generally speaking we had a lovely relaxing stay at the Dusit Thani.",4,2024-01-21

934554941,"I was expecting so much from this hotel but left feeling like I wasted my money. The only two things I can appreciate from this place is the friendly and professional staffs and their sunset view. But that's just it! 

I'd say breakfast was not that bad, but the other meals I had from this place was so underwhelming and awful. I'd suggest you eat out and enjoy your food elsewhere. I was excited to be in Cebu for the first time and not once do they even have their famous lechon here. 

I added on a package to include high tea and evening cocktails at their club lounge and it was so depressing there.. Their ambiance was gloomy, food was horrible, drinks I'd say was ok. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. 

Phone line and TV cable at one point was not working! For a 5 star hotel, surely this is not the kind of experience they expect their guests to have. 

There's so many details this hotel is missing and I wish they improve on this. Sunbed was not comfortable, there was no comb available in the room ( you'd need to call and ask), no bath salts (even though they provide a tub), you'd need to pay extra to avail the kids playroom, and maybe I'm just nit picking here but the hotel doesn't smell nice. Haha. I've been in a lot of nice hotels before and they always have a certain luxurious scent, but not Dusit Thani... 

I want to end on a little high note.. I spent my godson's 1st birthday dinner party here and all the staff was very helpful. Without them helping set up the dinner place and being flexible with their food menu, it wouldn't be as nice.",2,2024-01-18

F&B team in particular stand out for delivering first class service. (Alvin, Norwin, Clarence - thank you. Security and lifeguards - thank you!)

The grounds are lovely with beautiful views. Little private beach was nice too.
Unfortunately the hotel does fall short of 5* as the rooms are a little dated / old. Mine was damp. I would not say the rooms are that well kept. Amenities are fine.

Restaurants were lovely. Overall the hotel has an excellent vibe and I couldn‚Äôt fault it other than the room itself.

The humidity in the room could not be controlled.  The food and service were terrible.  Although the pool was nice, there were not enough lounge chairs for the number of guests at the hotel and the day pass users.

932830535,"A great hotel, overlooking the sea, with fantastic staff and great food. The rooms are a good size and very clean. Swimming pool is a great feature of the hotel, with the only challenge being that their are not enough sun beds for all of the guests and so we had to get up by 7am each morning to get a bed. Most of the beds are also fixed in a sitting position and very uncomfortable and without any mattresses. Didn't expect this for the standard of the hotel and the cost and  it did negatively impact our stay and many other guest complained. On a more positive note, the entertainment provided is great fun and the local dive school, Scotty's, is very highly recommended and they have a desk in reception. Highly recommend the onsite Thai restaurant after 3 visits. Also must mention the F&B team who work tirelessly at the sunset bar and are a real asset to the hotel.

I‚Äôm shocked that amenities provided needs extra payment (such as kids playground, hotels bikes..etc) Food is the weakest item, the breakfast is average but lunch buffet and New Year dinner was a disaster in my point of view! Staff always tried to be accommodating and trying their best to please.. but I think closing all restaurants in hotels to force hotel guests to pay for New Year‚Äôs eve dinner 6500pesos each(no drinks included) and provide poor quality was a rip off.. Manager Don, Ella and Leo who was the bar manager were very professional and try their best to please.. we got offered lunch as a compensation etc.. but in general I think the food quality needs improvement.

I do understand this might be a one time incident but i have to mention it to be fair. 
The serving off Parma Ham was a positive note for me personal.

The Beach area was not great, with warning signs to be aware of Jelly Fish when swimming.

* and special mention to Zairen and Shella the lobby hostesses who are on their Job Training - they‚Äôre really an asset to the team because the warm welcome and good goodbye really matters.

We had a very good stay, the place is really beautiful and everyone everywhere in the part of the hotel are all very nice.

The only negative that i need to mention and must be look into is the Bathroom.

The shower is the worst - because it made the whole toilet wet, we tried to position for the water to go in the bathtub - but the bathtub does not drain and the water stayed :-( we had to call housekeeping staff to dry the floor and empty the tub - thank you to Christy for always helping.

Another waiter came in several minutes after and we were told again only drinks were available. 

I complained to the waiter that a previous staff told us he will check about the pizza and never came back even thought at first we were told we can still order.

924310272,"First time visiting Cebu, i opted for the Dusit Thani as i have stayed in many around Asia, this hotel had all the qualities that are expected at a Dusit Hotel. The staff are very polite and friendly, The hotel is beautiful, the swimming pool is probably the largest one i have ever been in and is open until 10pm (12.00am at the weekend) so is great for night swimming. Breakfast was great, and more than enough options to choose from. The room was lovely, very comfortable bed, and great views over the sea. One criticism i would say, the bathroom doesn't have a door (i was in the executive club room) felt a bit strange, bathrooms should be private, but it was ok, the shower was amazing.  Very well equipped Gym. The club lounge was lovely, and the staff very friendly and helpful, especially Gerson, a great gut. I would happily recommend this hotel. ",4,2023-11-03

920301320,"I had the opportunity to revisit Dusit Thani Mactan on October 7, 2023, just yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised by the enhancements or improvement made to the facilities.

When we entered the hotel, the usher was friendly and helpful, although I forgot to check her name tag. She guided us to the front desk with a lovely smile, so acccomodating, assisting us all our needs. All the staff members you encounter are wearing smiles and warmly greet you.

Joshua, the friendly attendant at the towel station, was just as cheerful and accommodating as we headed to the pool for the kids' swim. I also observed him participating alongside Judy Ann during the Zumba dance exercise.

Twice a day, there was a Zumba dance session led by a girl named Judy Ann, who exhibited remarkable enthusiasm even under the sun's heat. Surprisingly, I also spotted her managing the Kids play zone. She's truly a valuable asset!

The lifeguards remained highly vigilant, evident from the occasional loud whistles I heard. This underscores the establishment's commitment to prioritizing safety and security, a significant factor in their operations.

It was also delightful to see our cultural dance, the tinikling, being performed with such excellence and also the I love Cebu theme! 

At noon, we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch, and all the dishes were exceptionally tasty. Unlike my previous visit in June, they now offer ice cream for kids, which my children thoroughly enjoyed. He also loved the pumpkin soup. The food left both me and my friend completely satisfied and full.  The waiter, Norwin, served us very well too at the pool. 

After our lunch, my children chose to play in their kids' play zone and was pleasantly surprised by the significant improvements. In my previous experience, there was no one attending to the area, but now I noticed that it's always staffed. We met Denthor, who entertained us. I hope they will continue to maintain this level of supervision for the safety of the children. I'm thankful that the management took my previous comment seriously and took action. Kudos and thank you.

There were numerous activities available, and we were delighted to partake in each one. From playing Badminton to riding the kalesa, the hotel came to life with vibrant lights and music at sunset, adding to our enjoyment.

We will certainly be returning soon. My sons has become quite enamored with all the activities and the delicious food.",5,2023-10-08

We were always greeted with smiles and friendly faces, everyone remembered our names and asked about our trip. We are traveling with a toddler and they went out of their way to make her smile and giggle. They were all extremely professional, accommodating, and friendly! We had great service at the restaurant  from Norwin who was great to talk to and very knowledgeable about the area. Febe and Gladys at the breakfast buffet were always so sweet to our toddler, and seeing them really brightened our morning every day!

We were absolutely blown away by how kind everyone was here, and it is the one thing we will remember the most!",5,2023-09-28
918765951,"We loved our stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu because the facilities and the service are world class. 

The facilities-- from the hotel room, bathroom, the restaurants, the manicured and well-maintained beachside pathways and lounge chairs with umbrellas, the big and small swimming pool -- were designed to give guests ultimate enjoyment in their vacation. The hotel staff are also very good, and they use their training to the best of their abilities to give the guests a great time at Dusit. Special mention goes to the following people who are very memorable because of the excellent guest service, their great personality and because they take time out to interact with us to make sure we were comfortable and we were enjoying ourselves -- Angelie and Min(the OJT) of the Trade Winds breakfast buffet, Teofy and Alvin of the Sunset Bar, Rome of the Benjarong Thai Restaurant and Shiela of the hotel lobby. 

I also enjoyed the aquarobics... The dance instructors are very athletic and very energized. Love them! Keep it up!

Lastly, some suggested areas for improvement: (1) when the room's shower is used, the water overflows to the entire floor space of the lavatory. Can this be resolved? We do not want slippery lavatory floors because it is a safety issue. You don't want guests to suffer an accident while at the hotel room. Putting the floor mat as a barrier is not enough because the mat gets soaked easily; (2) is the jetty always closed-off to the guests? it would be nice if it is open and can be the take-off point for boating or snorkeling..

Overall, our stay was superb! We love your hotel. We will definitely return.",5,2023-09-27

917624157,"From the minute we arrived and right throughout our stay to the minute we left all staff and management were all so
Beautiful made our 10 Day stay out of this world 

The resort and its facilities are a 10 out 10 and the huge difference is that staff and management are so respectful to anyone that comes to their establishment

The front desk and concierge staff are always looking out for you and the most helpful people and nothing was a problem to them. 

The breakfast buffet choice was widely spread and you could not leave without feeling full with the amount of food on offer and again every day everyone was greeted beautifully by the staff

If breakfast is included in your package - highly recommend- and you are booked on a early morning trip - the staff will pack you a nice take away breakfast 

Any speciality coffee like Cappuccino - lattes etc are part of the breakfast package unlike most other resorts 

The View Bar is exactly what it is as it has a spectacular view of the ocean and serves fantastic cocktails with highly skilled staff that make you feel like you are royalty

The sunset bar is a sports bar with darts pool table and karaoke with great lunches and dinners served is set just behind the infinity pool and is filled with fun staff dressed as referees is another place to enjoy 

The NAMM Spa is by far and large the most tranquil resort style spa with great masseurs that we would highly recommend their 2.5 hr package that includes body scrub - facial and massage

The 100 metre infinity pool is Devine with the ground staff always attending to the maintenance and upkeep of this huge pool but our favourite was the Rainforest Pool that is set with more shade and Bali Huts - that is so peaceful with the sound of the waterfall 

Our Ocean Room #3511 had everything that you could ask for with the fine detail of the housekeeping efforts that everyday made the room beautiful 

On top of that our room is a club room and the benefits that you get for these rooms is astounding with daily high teas - nightly cocktails with access the Club Room Lounge was a huge surprise and most appreciated gesture

The options from dinners you have on offer you never feel you need to leave this wonderful resort 

There are snack type meals available from the Sunset - beautiful BBQ‚Äô over looking the infinity pool - weekends buffet at the Tradewinds (where breakfast is served) or dine at the Korean Restaurant or The signature Thai Restaurant 

Even though we didn‚Äôt use these facilities but this resort has an absolutely amazing Kids indoor air conditioned play centre and a well equipped gym situated in complete privacy 

The grounds and maintenance to the property are continually being looked after in a very discreet way

The resort has so much to offer and the staff and management is the place to come and stay when next in the Philippines - we will be coming back and bringing our family members with us 

You rock Dusit Thani 

Big extra thank you to Mary, Christine, Andrea, Paul, Judy, Seth, Jomar, Faith, Les, Gia, Maria, Jay, Matt, Dindo, Jan, Claude, Dalen, Noren, Jen, Ritchel and if we have missed your name thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2023-09-21
917545226,"Our recent stay was excellent and we will surely be coming back! All staff were very courteous--- lifeguards, gardeners, engineers, cleaners, room attendants, waiters, you name it! Room attendants Jay, Den, Maria, and Dindo left us a heart-warming note in our room after cleaning. They did a job well-done! We made sure to leave a tip.

Breakfast buffet was huge and big-time! Choices were amazing! They have improved since March 2023 --but bacons are no longer on display so just make sure to ask the staff. We were taken care of by the Tradewinds cafe staff like Mary (always brought me bacon yayyy) and Kriz (he made us refreshing watermelon juice!). We enjoyed the Saturday night seafood buffet at the Tradewinds too with my family and tried the Cabana nights next to the pool with my friends whom I have invited over (for 1500 it was reasonably priced!). Sunset Bar's bao buns were a sure winner and a must-try. The Deli's gelato was one of our faves too! 

The Rami restaurant is a great addition to your hotel should other customers try a different kind of cuisine (Korean food) and I did love the beef bulgogi I ordered. We think Rami is not under the ownership of Dusit Thani but just wanted to tell other potential customers that they should try this resto too as their food was good and their staff were also very nice--- every time we passed by they would say Hi and Hello, just like how the whole staff of Dusit Thani were. Our experience at the Benjarong restaurant was also exceptional. 

Bed was huge and comfortable. Pillows were heavenly soft. Balcony was spacious and definitely a great addition to the room we booked because we always woke up to a very relaxing sea view every morning! Only wish is I hope you retained the Damana brand for shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and cleansing gel (what we originally had in March 2023). The recent ones we had now in September 2023 changed to generic-looking toiletries. It's a 5-star hotel, we would expect the packaging could be a little more top-tier.

I also had fun with the kalesa ride last Saturday as part of the hotel's weekend activity. The horse driver/owner even offered us to drive the kalesa with his supervision. Got to talk to him a bit and glad to hear that the hotel employs him on Saturdays. We also saw him enjoy the feast during the seafood buffet. The hotel truly employs and rewards them like their own customers. I also got to witness the world clean up day on Monday and Dusit Thani gave the people who did the cleaning with free food. Truly nice of them.

Special thanks to Enan and Niki! We met them originally in March during our first stay and our 2nd stay this month in September again.Nice to see familiar faces working indeed!

We also visited 2 competitor 5-star hotels nearby during our 7-day stay in Dusit Thani and so far we loved Dusit Thani's layout of the restaurant, pool, and the huge wide-open well-ventilated reception and hotel lobby area. Everything was perfectly situated. You can order food and drinks while at the pool. Or if you're just dining at the Sunset bar you can see the the whole view of the pool and the overlooking sea from behind. Other competitor hotels' facilities were just out of place, in our own opinion.

Other thing I just want to add is most taxi drivers really want us to add a bit $ on top of the meter once they know we are headed to this hotel. Once you are at the hotel, you will understand why. It's because you are almost at the tip or the Mactan Island and the drivers could hardly catch the next passenger as they will have to go back to the main roads of Lapu-Lapu to get the next one. I know it beyond the control of the hotel already. Staff at the lobby makes sure that they disclose there is an additional 100 pesos fare on top of the meter if you ride FROM the hotel. Hotel also gives you a taxi slip before you go (you can always contact LTFRB should you have any issues with the taxi drivers). The attitude of the drivers do not in any way reflect the hotel since that is already beyond the control of Dusit Thani. Just report the incident after you have left the taxi.

*** I know stray dogs and cats are not allowed in the property but my partner and I are animal lovers and we wished to have seen the same animals we saw in March but I don't see them anymore. I hope the animals are all okay and the management does no harm to them üôè

We highly recommend Dusit Thani if you're a family, couple, or a solo traveler. Book the one with the sea view and you will NOT regret it.

With love, 
Maria and Steven ‚ù§Ô∏è",5,2023-09-20

913794178,"I asked the front desk for help to eat Jollibee, which I really wanted to try in Cebu. (We couldn't use the Grab application) Ericson, a front desk clerk, made a great effort to order the menu from his personal cell phone. It was very touching to try to fulfill the request that the hotel system could not make. While trying to order, Jollibee's business hours were over, so we couldn't eat it, but later he found a Jollibee that wasn't closed personally and showed it to us. (Then we were in the pool and he came to see us himself!) But we had already placed an order at the hotel restaurant Sunset Bar. I couldn't eat Jollibee because it was the last day of our trip, but I was very touched by his passionate service. All the facilities in the hotel were excellent, the staff were friendly and the food was delicious. Thank you for making good memories in Cebu",5,2023-08-29

I mean, you're in this stunning tropical heaven, but the Wi-Fi acts like it's on a beach vacation too ‚Äì super slow and kinda unreliable. So if you're planning to upload all those jealousy-inducing beach pics or even just stream your favorite show, you might be in for some frustration.

(-) The soundproofing of the room needs improvement, we can hear the next room watching TV, moving their stuffs. The room itself is quite basic same as the bathroom for the price paid or for a Dusit Thani hotel.  A bathtub would have been nice as commented by my son.  Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.

(+) Dusit Thani hospitality still felt and happy about it. Great staff from the arrival, restaurants, housekeeping, pool, ground, they were friendly and genuine. No problem with parking.  Sunset view was superb either from the infinity pool or the bar.  On food, we had the following: in this order ---- dessert and coffee at The Deli, merienda at Sunset Sports Bar, dinner at Benjarong and breakfast at Tradewind‚Äôs Caf√©, food in all restos was tasty and appetizing.

897415931,"I recently had the opportunity to check out this esteemed hotel last week, and I am writing to share my concerns regarding the kids' play area. Unfortunately, my experience in that area was quite disappointing due to the absence of an attendant or staff member.

As a parent, I believe it is crucial to have dedicated personnel supervising and ensuring the safety of children in play zones. However, during my stay, I noticed that the kids' play area consistently lacked any staff presence. This lack of supervision raised several concerns for me.

Firstly, without an attendant, there was a significant risk of unruly behavior among children. I witnessed instances where children were left unsupervised, which resulted in disruptive and unsafe activities. This not only compromised the experience of other children but also posed potential hazards.

Additionally, the absence of an attendant raised concerns about the overall safety of the play area. Accidents can occur unexpectedly, and it is essential to have trained individuals who can promptly respond to any mishaps or injuries. The lack of a dedicated staff member made me question the level of priority given to the well-being of children utilizing the facility.

To address this issue, and if I may recommend that this hotel will consider employing an attendant specifically for the kids' play area. This staff member could ensure the orderly conduct of children, provide guidance when necessary, and be responsible for maintaining a safe environment. 

I must note that aside from this particular concern, I did find other aspects of possible staying at this hotel satisfactory. The ambiance is so relaxing and serene as noticed. However, the absence of an attendant at the kids' play area significantly affected my overall impression of the hotel.

I genuinely hope that the management will take my feedback into consideration and make the necessary improvements to enhance the experience for future guests. Having a well-supervised and safe kids' play area is vital for families who choose your establishment.

I trust that the management will take the necessary steps to address this concern and ensure a more enjoyable experience for families visiting this hotel.",1,2023-06-24

895968119,"I love beach and sea water where here in Dhusit only a portion of beach sand as everything else rocky area.
Since am not really fun of that as i got plenty near my home i prefer beach sand where i do like longer barefoot walk.
Also to note during my visit at the little portion where you can supposedly swim i was dissapointed too as loads of garbage floating around where management could have put 2 meters net under the float they put around their area. So basically no chance of swimming again on the beach side.
So went to pool instead but to note its only 4 meters deep only good for shorter in height and kids.
So to that will be your swim around the hotel.
Anyway Spa massage therapist are good!
Hopitality of staff is very good too!
Only complain was in 3days time no television working at all and blaiming provider.
The heck was that its room rate inclusive. Only compensation is a movie costing 500 pesos only..
This hotel is not cheap and price compared to other hotels nearby are better with White sand and sunrise.
Restaurant food buffet are a lot of food but wandering where those food go when only guest seen eating does not even fill half of its capacity.
The Thai Restaurant food was really good and that is where we could come back for!
To make you guys aware too this hotel is on the west side of Punta Engano Mactan where no cover after 12 noon and youll get the maximum heat of the SUN. Must bring 100% sunscreen and lots of water to drink to avoid dehydration.
So were on our next hotel and keep watching my next hotel 2023 reviews! 
At the end i still prefer other hotel same in price comparison and youll be spoilt and a rooms are nicer too! 

Enjoy your time whereever you wanna be!
Have a nice day!",3,2023-06-19

Got to my room, don‚Äôt feel safe and relaxed the windows are broken AC vent is dirty. My first time to stay in Dusit Thani Cebu. Doesn‚Äôt meet my expectation since I know Dusit Thani hotel/resorts has high ratings and review. But not Mactan Cebu, needs a lot of improvements.
The staff / servers were very friendly and accommodating. The front desk staff needs more improvements. If you are looking for a white sandy long stretch of shoreline, not here. Clear water not to rocky not this place as well. Thai Restaurant- Benjarong will never fail, always good.",2,2023-06-16

Thanks Clint. You deserve a raise. ,5,2023-06-12
894583178,"While most reviews are very good for this hotel I feel most are coming from locals that perhaps have not really experienced 5 star hotels in other countries. For a local this may be a great hotel but for me an International traveller it does not get past 3.5-4 stars at best.

Checkin was fine the hotel has a nice lobby and reception area. The room is quite small but at least clean.

This hotel is quite remote there is nothing but slums surrounding the hotel so there is really nowhere to go unless you drive. The hotel has a nice pool area however, it's packed with people and you feel like all eyes are on you when you're poolside. There are quite a few locals here with a day pass so the pool area is not exclusive to hotel guests. I ordered a pina colada at the poolside restaurant and was given a yellow drink. Aparently they had no coconut cream but if you dont have the key ingredient then don't serve it! They tried to correct the drink but to no avail.

Weeds are visible in green areas around the pool not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. 

ANNOYING: You must pay everytime you eat or drink anything at all restaurants and bars becuase as the staff say we are renting this from the hotel so we need to charge you and you cannot add it to your room.
When I am on vacation i DO NOT WANT TO PAY everytime I eat or drink something this is truly unacceptable.

BAD: If you need wifi don't come to this hotel! I complained that it is very slow and keeps breaking up. A technician came to my room who tried his best but could not resolve the wifi issue.

The wifi is unstable and slow I could not do business here.

POOR: There is no International style buffet reastaurant. At least not during the week. Staff told me it's only open on Sat/Sun lunchtime. There is a thai, and korean restaurant but if you don't like that style of food you have very little choice.

I asked housekeeping for camomile tea and was given green tea.
I could hear bing bing bing.... non stop coming from housekeeping's phone to the point where I had to ask her to place her phone on silent.

The breakfast was good and service was fine.

All round unless you want to spend the whole day in the busy pool area you will be bored here. I felt it is overpriced and more expensive than the Sofitel in Manila while nowhere nearly as good. I would not consider coming back here again.

",3,2023-06-12
894422559,There was only one person at the front desk you was polite only to tourists. He did say that our room is not ready yet but I need to pay for the room first. SideEye! And so we waited by the sunset bar and ordered food and drinks. Staff was very friendly. Still waiting ....,2,2023-06-11

893812063,"This was my first visit to Dusit and I had a wonderful experience. I wanted some alone time so I arrived on a weekday and stayed for 3 days. Being able to speak the vernacular, I could converse with the staff well and they readily indulged my requests. 

The food at Sunset Bar was relatively good, I highly recommend the the Angus Steak. Coffee preparation and presentation need to be improved (espresso-based preferred), and more a la carte dishes should be offered especially for solo travelers. I felt that Sunset Bar needed more variety especially if one plans to stay in the hotel for several days. 

Room Service was slow but the staff was very helpful. One thing I'd like to commend is that I genuinely felt the sincerity when the staff smiled and greeted me every morning. They were very hospitable and accommodating. I'd like to commend Norwin, Leo, and Janvie. I was mostly interacting with them during my stay, and they really excelled in customer service. 

Things to note: If you're looking at getting a tan, the pool is best from 8am-12nn. The beach is best reserved for reading and maybe some snorkeling (depending on the tide, weather, and the urchins). The beach unfortunately does not have fine sand, has a stony/rough sea bed with limited swimmable areas. SUP is offered as well for only P500++. ",5,2023-06-07

We appreciate this so much!!

I would also like to commend Guen Nagnal who is the attendant when I worked out in Dusit‚Äôs fitness area. She is very friendly and was even open to share about her good experiences as an OJT of Dusit. People are really nice and it counts a lot for your guests.",5,2023-06-05

893340937,"We are an extended family who went on a vacation for my dad's birthday. From the first day they allowed us to maximize our fun on the hotel stay. The reception personnel John was kind enough to let us check in early. They understood that kids that came from a plane ride needs to rest. He put all our rooms close to each other.

The Seaview room was spectacular. It has a balcony that overlooks the ocean and the pool or the ocean and the outdoor activity area. The balcony is big enough for you to enjoy tea time or dinner looking out the view.

The hotel has an indoor play area for children to enjoy and play with each other and a relaxing spa for the adults to unwind.

The infinity pool overlooks the awesome shipwreck anchored at the beach.
The pool is not very deep but deep enough  for you to ve submerged even if you are standing, and a there is also a bar beside the pool for you to enjoy some drinks while you swim. There is a separate kiddie pool that can accommodate toddlers.

They do have a spacious gym with a view of the ocean and a yoga class outdoor overlooking the beach.

The circular hotel bar at the lobby offers a great view of the stars and ocean.

They offer various restaurants to cater to different tastes; a korean resto, a thai resto and a sports bar near the pool where you can play billiards and watch sports tv.

Most of the patrons are couples but there are a few families as well.

Since Mactan is far from the city, they offer a complimentary shuttle to take the guests to the different malls in the city.",5,2023-06-04

893180532,"There are four restaurants available in this 5-star hotel which serves filipino, thai and korean food. One of them is trendwinds cafe (buffet) which has a good seaview. We also tried sunset bar which is nearby the infinity pool (serves ala carte menu and has a billiard table where you can play) and the other one is the Rami restaurant which is new to the hotel so they don't offer charge to room option. All of these restaurants serves good food. For the room, it has shower, hair dryer and built-in-cabinet with ironing board and iron. The gym also has a great sea view, so you can exercise while enjoying the sea view.

Besides the infinity pool, they also have the rainforest pool which is much smaller and perfect for kids. Expect a crowd on their infinity pool as it has the best view which is loved by the guests.

Water activities are also available, such as parasailing, jetski (1 hour use) and snorkeling.

The hotel is 45 minutes away from the airport, traffic included. There are times wherein I'm having a hard time connecting to the internet via mobile data as I had to attend a zoom meeting. Unfortunately, I cannot connect using their wifi for my zoom meeting, seems that it's blocked but I can browse the internet with their wifi. I love that I only have to connect once using the username provided and my device is connected to wifi wherever I am in the hotel unlike in other hotels, if you leave the room, you'll have to connect to their public wifi.

According to my observations, hotel staff were very friendly and did not give you strange looks; even local tourists were treated very well. I've stayed at Sheraton, Shangrila, Crimson, and Plantation Bay, to name a few, and as a former hotelier who worked in the same industry years ago, I can definitely compare how well-mannered and heartwarming Dusit Thani's employees were. Please continue to treat our fellow Cebuanoes with the same level of respect and hospitality that foreigners are shown.
I can say I will definitely come back again and hope to receive the same experience.

Please ensure that your driveway leading to the hotel has clear signs and directions for incoming guests who bring their own vehicles. Some guests get lost on their way to the condo villas and must find their way back to the hotel entrance. Appropriate lighting in your driveway would also be beneficial.",5,2023-05-30

890375807,"We had a decent stay until the last night. Lydia from the breakfast staff was incredibly rude and lack any sort of customer service skills. When we started eating, she insisted that the breakfast was not included and we had to pay 2300PH in the worst possible tone. After finishing, she ran across the lobby to give us the bill and ensured we paid. When we took it up with front desk, breakfast was in fact included (add-on upon check in) and she obviously came running to us to ensure that she was not at fault for this error. Not to mention, there was no apology from her or her team, did not serve us at all during the meal and they waited in the front of the lobby to ensure she can get her words in. Why let us into the restaurant saying that the meal was included, only to retract that statement before our meal?

I think this needs to be brought up as for a 5 star hotel, staff make up the experience. Better scanning for candidates in the hospitality industry should be a priority.",1,2023-05-14

King from Concierge team was friendly and welcoming from the moment we met him. He was ever-ready to assist us with our bags, inquiries and requests. Jeffrey from Benjarong was very attentive during dinner service, constantly ensuring that our dining experience was enjoyable. The service extended by King and Jeffrey is what I had expected from Dusit Thani. Thank you for the memorable stay!

Long infinity pool, beach area is quite small and not conducive to walk barefoot due to small pebbles/seashells instead of sand. Breakfast buffet was superb - there were many varieties of food and beverages to choose from. There were stations for bread, eggs, noodles, cheese and cold cuts, local desserts, and fresh fruit juices. You can try local Filipino, Korean, Indian, Italian, and Japanese dishes. It was also a unique sight to see staff walking around carrying local taho container over his shoulders and calling out 'Taho!' so guests can try it. The Sunset Bar and Benjarong resto were also very good. Lastly, my sisters and I also tried the Namm Spa and it was so relaxing and therapeutic!    ",4,2023-05-01

885563977,"We've been there yesterday with my family (spouse and kid) and with a friend and her kid for Easter Egg Day Hunt. We we're looking for some decent property, not crowded that can accomodate our kids Easter Day experience. We are frequent travellers (local and abroad) and been here the 1st time. So we checked it out if it's worth a try. Me and my friend paid registration online and communicated via email and phone.

Pros:
1. Excellent property and breath taking view of the Mactan Channel.
2. Food is good.
3. Ample parking space.
4. F&B staff are good. Kudos Carlo from F&B
5. Security guys are nice.
6. Restrooms are within proximity 

Needs Improvement. 1 out of 5.
1. Lifeguards approached us more than 4 times different times, same issue
- We were initially told that pool towel is not applicable for Day Use (okay. Properties like Jpark, Plantation Bay, Bluewater, Crimson, Shang are not like this. So we thought your property, your rules.) 
- We will pay for extra adult that will swim to guard our kids while swimming but due to excess people in the Kid Zone they cant accomodate me and advised to go back later for payment. (We already made prepayment for our kids but never anticipated to pay for 1 adult, hence paying at the hotel) 
- I was asked for a receipt for the adult to swim. But hey, I was asked this question minutes I came from Kids Zone. I also approached front office to pay but referred me to another person.
 - We were told that pool use is included in the Easter Day Egg Hunt. 
- I asked the lady from Kid Zone reported this 2nd time and was told that lifeguards are monitoring guests for possible lost pool towels. (But hey! Why are we being singled out and being monitored?  For someone who is trying to enjoy the view, the experience. Your lifeguards assumed we are going to take your pool towels? Lol 
- Food menu QR 
- Our kids had fun with Easter Egg Day Hunt experience but needs improvement with execution
- After event, I approached the front office to pay for 1 adult for pool only use. Luckily I saw April from Kid Zone and paid the fee. (So why front office has to bounce me to another person if you can process my payment?) I've been passed around 3 times and your lack of coordination played a big role to our experience. 
- Some staff has this discrimination for local guests despite that we can afford all fees you impose us. Mind you, we are picky to resorts when we thought Dusit is one of them.

We might go back for check in and see the experience if it improves. I hope some of your staff will stop this discrimination to Filipino local guests.

881993001,"Stayed for several nights in a club room.  Hotel itself is nice but very spread out.
I booked a club lounge room and emailed to let them know myself & daughter are coeliac and they confirmed back saying they could accomodate us with gluten free food. 
Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt rely this message to the club lounge so our first day all they could offer us was a salad- not good enough when I‚Äôm paying top dollar for a room.
The worst was when we left- they ordered a taxi for us to the airport- they told us it was metered.
I paid my outstanding bill (recipes kept).  It is a 30 min drive to the airport.  15 mins into the drive the taxi driver got a ph call.  He pulled off to the side of the road and started yelling at us that he had to turn around and we had to pay 400 pesos to the hotel.  The hotel were on speaker and were also yelling at us. I asked the driver to please drive as I have paid my bill and we would miss our flight.  After much yelling we started again only to have the hotel continually state we owed them money.  When we arrived to the airport the driver asked for more than double what the hotel said it would be.  I asked where the meter was- he said it was broken.  I said that‚Äôs not good enough the hotel said it was metered.  
He ended up slamming the boot door on my daughters arm- myself and my daughter were in tears at the airport.  This is simply not good enough from any hotel.
I will be taking this matter up with head office when I return home. ",1,2023-03-13

881781412,"I took my mom and dad to Dusit Thani Mactan last November. It was a bit hard to contact the hotel from the United States, but thankfully, Marejun got in touch with me through Whatsapp and did everything possible to assist me, from upgrading my room, and for the dining vouchers. It was very impressive. When we arrived at the resort, we were given a very warm welcome by the hotel staff. The check-in process was smooth, the bellman assisted us with our bags, and the young ladies brought us some goodies along with a handwritten letter from the General Manager. The room was spacious and was very clean. The toilet have complete amenities with a nice bathtub. It has a big balcony facing the bay and overlooking the City of Cebu. The whole resort was not crowded, so it's very ideal for those who want to have a tranquil vacation. We had our dinner on the first night at Benjarong. Kudos to our waiter Javier for a very personalized touch and for continuously checking on us. He and his team even sang a birthday song to my parents which I really appreciate. The Thai food choices were great! The next early morning, the hotel's ambience was very refreshing. The pool water was warm, and seriously, this was the best infinity pool I've ever seen, complete with loungers and cabanas with no extra cost. Overall, I rate our stay there as excellent, and I'd love to come back again. Hopefully, they would open the beach access very soon.

880737599,"We were here for a night to celebrate the new year. The pictures shoes the beautiful pool but there was a storm here some time back and with that a big container ship is stranded here and that was kind of cool to look at with a great story about the ship from the staff. The hotel staff was very accommodating and their bartender was top notch. The room was great and went well over our ecxpectations. However there was one thing I got disappointed by since this is a five star hotel and that was that they didn't bother cleaning the ice tray in our room but they did change it the moment I asked for it but still. That is when I noticed that this was a trend that kept coming. later they weren't quite ready with the evening activity that people had payed for. They set up the place wile we were all getting our welcome drinks and they weren't ready before maybe 30 min before midnight, they had done everything half way and uncoordinated. They had a fire show at the end but that was small and seemed unplanned since it looked like someone just practicing more then giving a show. She had a great technique its just not a performance yet but I think if she had time to plan then she could be great.
I hope they can fix this for next time since their venue deserved better as we visited a few hotels on this trip and this was the most luxurious venue we could see in Cebu.

879689691,"Shout Outs:
The staff are kind, warm, and hardworking Seth (Deli) , Lovely (Deli), Ditchie (Sunset Bar), and Maria (Room Attendant) were beyond exceptional. If only the faciities, food, and front desk were as exceptional than this truly would be a 5 star hotel. 

Our Journey:

We choose Dusit Thani Cebu because we have stayed at numerous other properties throughout the world and have alywas found the service and accomdations truly superb.  Unforutnately I am not certian how this property is associated with the Dusit Thani Brand.  
  
Our group had  a total of three rooms booked which were all the Deluxe Rooms (the lowest category room).  Upon check in we were shocked at how small the rooms were (granted the size of the room is listed in the booking I did not pay attention assuming a 5 star hotel would only have reasonable sized rooms).   Beyond being smaller than expected all three of the rooms had significant problems (1) one of the rooms tv controller did not work and the television kept flickering (2) one of the rooms in the bathroom floor had no lip (which was not the case in 2 of the other rooms) which resulted in flooding when showering, (3) one of the rooms had several ants and (4) all of the air conditioning was very very weak (even after calling and having them serviced.  All these things were so bad I went down to the front desk to ask if we could cancel and move to a different hotel. Unfortunately, they said one of our bookings were prepaid and they could not give us a refund, but I could call Chase Ultimate rewards and ask for a refund of any non used days. I called immediatley and was told that Chase would need to ask the hotel and to call back later. Well the that next morning we had a tour booked to go to Olsob for Whale Shark Excursion (awesome you should do it) and when we came back  I went to talk to the front desk they upgraded us to club rooms, which was nice in size and the air conditioning worked!  Unfortunately on Tuesday and Wednesday the internet went from 150mbs down to 3 to 8mbs, which prevented me from being able to access my VPN for work (which was one of the reason I booked here for WIFI) it was like this durring the workday 9:00am-4:00pm.  i noticed durring my stay when the hotel is hosting a conference the internet becomes almost non usable for streaming videos or accessing  a VPN to conduct work is not possible. 

The rooms showers are also rather disgusting and I think re-caulking or deep cleaning the grout should be performed.  There is a serious lack of proper drainage which causes  part of the shower to become extremely slippery.

I've since booked another hotel even through I have a booking for 3 more nights (don't know if I will get refunded), because I can not stand the lack of true 5 star ammenities I've come to expect when staying at Dusit Thani properties.  I am hopeful the hotel will refund me the unused portion of my reservation and implment some improvements outlined below so they truly can become a 5 star facility. 

Recommendations to Management: 

*Have staff welcome guests upon check in and introduce themselves.  Have your front desk give an overview of the resturants and facilities. Also it would be nice for the staff to explain the big ugly boat ruining the view that guests paid top dollar to see and explain that even though one of the buildings is being worked on construction and noise will not be heard during the night. 

*Please ensure air conditioning in building 2 is working just as good as building 3, The difference is rather drastic. 

* I was asked 5 times in my stay to do a review on trip advisor even though on 3 of the conversations I said my stay was below expecations (maybe it was a language barrier), but I would train staff to apologize instead of asking for a review on trip adivsor. 

*In the breakfast buffet have staff fill coffee at the tables more frequently or make recommendations on some of the highlights of the buffet that day.  Also make sure the breakfast buffet serving utensils are placed properly. Two times  at 6:20am dishes were missing serving utensils. 

*Sunset bar service is slow. I am not sure if it is the kitchen or what, but the food time seems excessive.  Figure out a better way to stream line the process to increase the speed. 

*Research ways to prioritize or create seperate WIFI signals for guests and conference attendees so that service for hotel guests work the entire time.

*Better promotion of the special dinning events occuring at resturants. We were notified of the event last minute and could not attend.  The hotel should have access to booking emails and should send out any weekly events that coud be of interest. 

*Fix the lack of lippage in some of the rooms showers to ensure they do not continue to flood the entire bathroom floor.

877507693,"We arrived to our room and found it to be a room with a connecting door. This meant the family next door (despite not being very loud) could be heard clearly in our room. Outside the view was the car park and a scaffolding. We called reception and explained the situation and to be fair they moved us to a room without a connecting door.

The restaurant - We arrived back from a lovely trip and fancied some 5 star cuisine. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes (not too long so no problem) and nobody had come over. We went to retrieve the menu and poured our own water whilst we waited. After another 10 minutes, still no one had served us (again not a problem) so we went up to the bar and ordered. My main meal (a burger) came and I started eating and we thought the other meal would be a arriving soon, my partners (chicken adobo) did not arrive. Sometimes there is a delay so no problem. 35 minutes later her food had still not arrived. At this point no one had addressed us or mentioned the delay. We explained this to the staff and the waitress said ‚Äúthe kitchen was busy‚Äù which again, we understand. We just explained that it is nice to eat together and that for the price that is what we would also expect. We said to them don‚Äôt worry about the 2nd meal to which the manager then became involved and said they‚Äôd take the 2nd meal off the bill. Fair enough. The bill comes and there is a service charge? What service? I said there is a service charge here but we‚Äôve not really had too much service, to which he said it‚Äôs included in the bill. Okay, no problem - paid it. 

Ironically, at most opportunities the waiters ask you to leave a trip advisor review explaining that you‚Äôve had good service and they give you their name. A little scan me code appears on your table and then away you go writing your positive review. 

The gym - went to the gym to work off them meals that were not coming from the kitchen. Inside there was a party of about 12 people also using the gym. There was no one manning the desk and inside was an absolute circus. They were playing football with the yoga balls and had kids running around picking up the different gym equipment and in general, screaming. 

The water - each day you are stocked with two waters. They are shot size versions of waters. Fair enough they say if you need restocking that they will do this. We asked reception for more water (did not come) then asked room service via telephone for 4 waters to see us through the day. They knocked and brought two. If you want to clench your thirst, you will have job. 

Room service - We ordered sweet potato fries and chicken cesar wraps (total cost with service) 20 pounds. Nothing too unreasonable. However, the food was appalling. Would say it‚Äôs the worst room service I‚Äôve ever had. 

All in all it is 2 or 3 star place dressed up as 5 star via the reviews they encourage you to make on the actual times when they should be bringing you your dinner. More time bringing dinner, less time asking for reviews.

We will get a response to this by someone who will say something along the lines of thanks for your feedback and we will look into this and try to improve. Well, you obviously don‚Äôt.

Additionally, because the hotel is so bad and they know it. They try to wash out all the negative reviews by getting the waiters to consistently ask for positive reviews and get you to name drop them. Which is why you‚Äôll see most reviews saying I was served by ‚ÄúX‚Äù who gave me great service. 

650 pounds for 4 nights = food that never comes, busy kitchens, car park view, a rave in the gym and miniature bottles of water that wouldn‚Äôt keep an ant hydrated.",1,2023-02-05

876681005,"The only thing Dusit Thani is good at is saying thank you sir and appearing like servants.  Our room had multiple leaks from multiple spots, light fixtures hanging and broken and the shower also didn‚Äôt work properly.  The breakfast was incredibly expensive for the area and offered less than a Jollibee especially if you went down anytime after 8:30 in the morning.  Majority of the options were just not offered a second time if they had been finished so the few good items are only consumable if you wake up at 6AM on your vacation.  The pools are overcrowded and unheated.  The hotel is also located way too far to go anywhere so that you are charged extra pesos to get a taxi.  Some of the rooms and buildings are undergoing construction with no change in rates and the rooms are anything but soundproof.  We could hear our upstairs and downstairs neighbors regularly.  I had stayed at 5 other hotels during my time here and this one is far and away the worst.  Staff assisted with my bags on one occasion and we had to walk from the end of the building 3 parking lot with our entire luggage case and had to drag it through the sewage waste located at that lot.  I could not rate this hotel lower.",1,2023-01-28

I assume most of these positive reviews are left due to staff shoving a QR code in their face and standing there with a smile and name badge.

875680834,"Please do not stay at this hotel.  Below is a list of all things we encountered in the first 12 hours of our stay:

1.  Don‚Äôt let the lobby or infinity pool fool you.  While these are very nice and well designed for the perfect Instagram or marketing photo, the rest of the hotel lacks any upgrades or detail

2. The Dusit does not believe in AC or even fans for any common areas or the sports bar making it very muggy

3. During our stay, the hotel was clearly understaffed catering to the Hyundai convention.  As a matter of business, they should be taken care of the best, however poor planning doesn‚Äôt mean the remains guests service should be sub par including bathrooms that had standing fluids on the floor for elongated periods of time 

4. Our check in was prompt, however there was only one attendant at the desk.  We booked through Expedia which may be why our deluxe room has windows that haven‚Äôt been cleaned in years and faces the garbage bins / parking lot 

5. Continuing with the rooms, the last renovation must have been completed  in the 90‚Äôs.  The cabinets and drawers are of poor quality / very old

6. Our shower (likely the most disturbing) hasn‚Äôt had a thorough cleaning in years.  The grout is severely discolored and something may be growing there. 

7. The beds have a thin mattress pad, however it can‚Äôt hid the uncomfortably hard mattress underneath 

8. The restaurants / dining experience had many flaws.  Again, likely due to the convention, many items had run out from mineral water to various food selections.  This again is simply poor planning where a chicken wrap should not take an hour with only 6-10 tables being utilized.  

10. Lastly, when we arrived, the pool was closed for water treatment.  Many of the marketing photos were of this pool that couldn‚Äôt be used as there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any beach access

I will point out that the wifi and breakfast were very good, however there were many smaller things, and likely more to come, not listed.  We came to Cebu expecting to have some Filipino culture but quickly came to realize this hotel is neither comfortable nor enjoyable.  Don‚Äôt book if it‚Äôs more than $50 usd a night.",1,2023-01-19

However we had a room in the third building, & it seems there are still issues from being closed during the pandemic & after the recent typhoon.
The room was well appointed, with a beautiful balcony,  but smelled excessively of damp, resulting in condensation running down the walls, & slippery floor. This smell is apparent upon entry to the whole building. We did enjoy our stay, but suggest that until this is sorted, the rates should be lower than they currently are.",4,2023-01-17

875258873,"Having stayed here twice pre-pandemic it was a little disappointing third time round. It feels like the pandemic and typhoon have hit the hotel hard and there hasn‚Äôt been the investment needed to keep it at the level of a 5* property.

We had to move room after our first night (avoid 1313 unless you like rooftop views) but after that things did improve a little.

Instead, they communicated that my ‚Äúbooking will still be valid‚Äù should I decide to change my plans. This would involve me coming to the hotel while positive for Covid, which they didn‚Äôt seem to have an issue with?

- Gerson and Kevin from the Club Room provided superb customer service.  We received custom crafted cocktails, tasty snacks, and wonderful gifts.  Gerson went out of his way on our final day to say goodbye.  He was very caring and compassionate.  We made a new friend.
- Erickson at the Front Desk recommended the Club Room and it was a wonderful perk!  Thanks for granting my birthday wish!
- Mario from Security gave us a personal tour of the resort and provided insider tips to make our stay more comfortable.
- Concierge (I'm sorry I forgot your name) recommended fun excursions around Cebu.  Swimming with the whale shark was the most memorable part of our trip!

Experienced and tasted choices of cocktails , wines as well as well as the variety of  finger Foods  Overall  evaluation was that everything was great and suited to the occasion and my taste buds. I met the GM Mike who was so patient , accommodating and meeting the different guests who attended the event. Above all the service was above Par excellence starting from Banquet Manager Mr Jomer Paraiso, Nikko- Bar tender, Roel - waiter. On the sidelights were the hardworking personnel named Lovely, Adriana and the rest of the staff. I felt safe due to the presence of the security supervisor Mario. While watching the fireworks , it was my best experience witnessing the display and technology in front of me and my wife. We highly recommend Dusit Thani Mactan and give them 20 stars.

Let me start with the positive, the staff is great, super friendly and helpful, luckily, otherwise this stay would have been an utter disappointment. The rooms are to small and although clean, are rundown and could do with a makeover.  We had to ask for an additional bed as the supposedly queen size beds had been more like a single European sized bed and  hence, we had quite a ‚Äûcamping feel‚Äú  during nights. The poolside is nice, but you have to be there around 08:00 am to find deck chairs, as most of them are taken/reserved by 08:30‚Ä¶.food choice at breakfast was good, but also here, last morning no more fruit choices, first morning, coffee machine broken‚Ä¶.Gym facilities are good, beach is not nice, as it is rather dirty and definitely would not recommend this hotel if you look for a beach holiday!",3,2023-01-01
873555706,"Dusit Club room facing the ""Garden"" which in fact was the local work camp location & homes. Views of other large island resorts etc. The room was freezing cold, even after asking 4 times Club staff to have it looked at - Nothing happened, unfortunately. The local Taxi scam was an issue arranged/encouraged by the Hotel was a little upsetting. Reported to Concierge staff who arranged the Taxi and was told THEY WOULD HANDLE IT? No response from staff to us. Location is an issue if you wish to commute to Cebu City. Maybe they need a shuttle service? Maybe it was the time of year, but the excessive VAT/SERVICE CHARGE and two local taxes seemed a little excessive, given the actual price of the rooms during this period. The pool area is extremely slippery, as I experienced. The pool is large and clean. The Dusit Club is an Oasis and we used it a lot.

There is an Infinity Pool which must have been 100m! There is a small private beach which you can swim in and there is also a 2nd smaller swimming pool nearby. 

Altogether, we had a lot of food and drinks in a very relaxing environment. The rooms had everything and I did not miss not having a balcony! The staff were very attentive.

If there way one thing that I did not like, it was that part of the hotel was like a building site. A bit of an eye sore. However, I would recommend this hotel for anybody looking to get away. 2 nights was enough though as we ate and drank too much!!",4,2023-01-01

The Hotel is nice and and the rooms are clean. The restaurants good and the staff is very engaging.
The few to the city is beautiful but the view is a bit damaged due to an massiv abandoned Tank ship next to the hotel. Another thing I didn‚Äôt like was the beach, the water is dirty and not very welcoming to swim in it.
But the pool is amazing!",4,2022-12-31

We spent 8 nights in this hotel in december 2022. The hotel is average We had a very average experience overall, everything was money in this hotel. Food was shocking, expensive and not nice at all. Breakfast menu was the same every single day, no vegetarian or Halal meals were available. Staff service was just okay, depending on their mood I guess. Definitely not coming back and would not recommend it. ",1,2022-12-28
873103333,"The hotel is beautiful but the service is not up to 5-star standards. It appears the front desk and cleaning departments are woefully understaffed despite many other staff milling around the front lobby area.
We tried to check-in at 2:30pm after standing in a long slow-moving line. We were told the room was not ready which was not a big deal since standard check in is 3pm. I specifically asked what time the room would be available and was told they were trying for before 3pm. Unlike at a true 5-star, they made no offer to contact me when the room was available so we just sat in the lobby. At 3:15 I got back in the long line at the front desk and finally reached it at 4pm. The story was now that the room would not be available until 5:30pm. If they told me 5:30 originally, we would have changed into our swimsuits and enjoyed the pool. I was offered a downgrade to a smaller size bed without a sea view which was declined. We accepted the offer to wait in the lounge with free snacks and drinks . Around 5pm a staff member sought us out in the lounge to notify us that our room was available and we needed to go to front desk for our keys.  If they are going to take the time to find us, why not bring us the keys as expected for a 5-star? We had already waited for over an hour at the front desk and the lines were still long and slow-moving so we went for an early dinner. 
Benjarong Restaurant is highly recommended, they were fully booked but accommodated us due to the issues we were experiencing trying to get our room. 
We were finally able to get our keys after dinner and the room is large and comfortable and exactly as promised on the website. Hopefully the rest of our stay will be smoother than the check-in process was.",3,2022-12-28
873023332,"I would describe this as Dusit Thani Light. Whilst standards are high, the hotel is not as well appointed as their urban hotels. Maybe because it is pitched as a resort. You can tell it is a resort because male staff have to wear shorts!
Our room was well appointed and comfortable, but overlooked an area being renovated. Not the end of the world but‚Ä¶
Breakfast was an extensive buffet which ticked the boxes. At other times the food offering was a bit limited, but adequate. There was a Thai restaurant but it seemed to be permanently deserted.
Nice outside pool. Decent gym.
Staff were all excellent. Professional and friendly.
We enjoyed our stay and would go back. But, the downside to the hotel is that it is at the end of a bumpy road at the end of Mactan Island. Middle of nowhere! Ok if you stay on site but tedious if you want to go out.",4,2022-12-28
873009389,"+ Very friendly and helpful stuff at the restaurant
+ Very good breakfast with a lot of various options 

- Extremely slow on check ins and outs. 
- We arrived at 17:30 - two and a half hours - after check it time - and still had to wait more than an hour for our room to be ready
- Very loud rooms - you can hear your neighbor breathing 
- Only one power plug next to beds in a twin bed room 
- The lower part of the door to the bathroom/toilet is for some reason designed like an open window shades so you can hear everything ""happening"" there. 
- During the day there was no hot water in the shower, only lightly warm
- Bathroom gets flooded after shower
- Extremely cold, not heated pool
- Very bad service at the pool: waiter comes by every 40 min, (forgot straws for cocktails and didn't bring them even after reminding)
Very small sand beach which has no meaning when low tide. 

==> All in all : overpriced hotel with very slow service and bad design choices",3,2022-12-27
872992288,"We stayed at the resort in November, 2022.  We used the airport pick up service they offer and had no trouble with that or with the check in process.  The room was nice and overlooked the ocean.  The resort is still in the process of recovering from Typhoon Odette, so there was construction going on which meant some noise and some closed off areas.  This caused the only issue we had --a door that was being used by the construction workers would slam extremely hard every time they used it, shaking the wall in our room.  I spoke to the front desk and they did try to remedy the issue.   Overall the stay was very nice. The staff was outstanding.  I've never had an experience where the staff was as polite and friendly as the staff at this resort.  We definitely enjoyed my time here, and if my travels take me back that way I would love to stay there again.",5,2022-12-27
872749593,"Dusit Thani Mactan is a five-star hotel. As a hotelier myself, I expected five-star end-to-end guest service experience.

Unfortunately, Dust Thani Mactan fell below expectations. The food and ambience- great. We loved our Christmas Eve Dinner at Benjarong.

Most of the staff was great, except for the Chef in-charge at the omelette section of the breakfast buffet at the Tradewinds outlet, who argued with his assistant in front of me while I was waiting for my egg omelette.

What was off-putting and very disappointing was when we requested to have our dinner and breakfast billed to our room. For both instances, the staff told us ""we will check if that's possible"" only to tell us a few minutes later that they cannot do it! So we have to return to our room to get our credit card.

What an inconvenience! The lady at the Breakfast Buffet lobby didn't even look sympathetic at all-what we got is the ""it's your problem, not mine"" vibes. I don't understand why a five-star hotel cannot bill-to-room meals by checked-in guests.
Why are they making this inconvenient for us, I cannot fathom!

Isn't it the point of a Five-star rating to have a cut-above-the-rest guest service experience? Is this the Dust Thani Guest Service standard: to refuse a checked-in guest's bill-to-room request and actually choose for the guest to walk back to a separate building to get the credit card? 

I mean we are in a resort, and as guests we don't think it's practical to bring our credit cards and wallets all the time, right?

If Shangri-la Mactan can do it for us, why can't Dusit Thani Mactan? Both are five-star hotels. I worked at a five-star hotel abroad and I cannot understand, both professionally and personally why Dusit Thani Mactan would allow such inconvenience to their hotel guests.",3,2022-12-25

871469014,"The Dusit Thani resort in Mactan has far exceeded the standards of most other resorts, and I should know. 
I am a former employee of the Hilton Corporation and have had held many hospitality positions in my career. In this field I have visited resorts in the US, Thailand, and the Philippines. The Dusit Thani wins. Here is why:
The guest experience is finely curated from the first step onto the immaculate grounds, to the pools, and even the restroom facilities, which are difficult to maintain. The restaurants are staffed by crews of well trained and resourceful staff members who truly take pride in their jobs, you can actually see their smiles even beneath their masks! 
I write this review today after several particular examples of phenomenal customer service by these staff members. First, my ATM card was declined at the ATM on site which caused me some distress. I needed to go to town and the taxis only take cash. One employee Nikki, recognized my dilemma and gave me taxi fare from his own pocket with nothing but trust that I would pay him back. 
Second, I went to dinner at the amazing Thai restaurant. I was greeted with a friendly smile and placed at a beautiful  table with a complimentary anti oxidant drink, and a cold hand towel. 
After perusing the menu, I didn‚Äôt find my favorite Thai dish, beef pad kra pow, and ordered some other items. My server Mardie immediately went to the Chef and asked if they would make my favorite dish, which he happily agreed. It was delicious!
During my meal, Clint, Mardie, Trisha, Jeffery and Kirby made me feel like a very special guest, and if I had a resort, I would try to steal all of them away. Lastly, even though management works mostly behind the scenes, it is obvious they are working hard to ensure thar the guest experience lives up to Dusit Thani standards. 
Well done everyone!",5,2022-12-12
871421805,"First experience was a dirty public restroom. Upon check-in we were told that the seaview room is already full since we arrived at 6pm. When we got to the room, there was no coffee packs. Only sugar and creamer.  Bed blanket was upside down. Breakfast buffet option was limited and was not refilled fast enough. when we returned to our room in for an afternoon break, there was only one towel for a family registered room. We found what we think is a covid test kit in the fridge. Again, the coffee pack was not refilled. Upon checkout, I inquired about the promo discount on my credit card. I was informed the rates on my nilling was already doscounted. I asked for the original computation without the discount, only then was I given a new receipt with the same billing but now with the right discount.

We came to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs birthday and the resort just made it so memorable for my daughter and the whole family. The check in and check out has been done very smoothly with very friendly staff and allow flexibility of late check out. We were recommended the best suite from the beginning which can accommodate the whole member of the family, it was large, spacious, wide balcony facing the ocean.Thanks to our housekeeping who takes care of full cleanliness and the special towel arts and fresh flowers. The signature purple sweets/ cakes arranged as welcome compliments so creamy and tasty. We are all so in love with it. We also had the club lounge access which we don‚Äôt need to worry our snacks throughout the day. The restaurant that serves breakfast offers delicious international and native cuisines and all restaurant staff were very friendly and attentive, in addition they surprised my baby girl a lively birthday song during our meal. You have to visit their Thai ‚ÄúBenjarong‚Äù restaurant as well, as it has the most authentic and best Thai flavors you‚Äôll surely love, thanks to Jeffrey, he‚Äôs very professional and knows what‚Äôs best for our appetite and love to mention, they greeted and sang a happy birthday to little girl during our dinner ( something that we haven‚Äôt expect!) .

869943217,"Overall I found the Dusit Thani Mactan to be more like a 4-star property. It is very average and not at all value for money I paid for the room.
- The architectural design isn't user friendly. Layout of bathrooms isn't functional. You end up wetting the whole bathroom while showering.
- Rooms are small for 32sqm. Lot of space is wasted in the entrance vestibule and area probably includes the balcony. The rooms are very small.
- Swimming pools weren't clean. There were some dirt and particles floating in.
- The 'beach' is not a beach as such. Completely rocky. Huge challenge if you go swimming / snorkeling. 
- The view from Sea View Rooms is not bad, though beyond the sea, you see the island of Cebu so the view isn't infinite.
- The food was just average. Service was slow.
- Staff, just like everywhere in the Philippines, were very polite but not trained very well. A lot of construction persons were using the guest lifts very often. That brings to the fact that many parts of the hotel are under construction.
- The Thai restaurant - Benjarong - was awesome, including taste, awesome presentation and super staff!
- Location is far from anything around. Nearest place where you can get some groceries / convenience store is Newtown, around 10min drive.
OVERALL - I wouldn't mind staying here if it was under USD 120 per night but for the current rates, I am not returning. Sorry guys.",3,2022-11-28

There is also construction going on at the resort which was not stated on the website or the 3rd party site I booked from. There should be a clear message for all potential customers that this is the case before we book.

865771688,"The GOOD stuff : Special mention to the following staff who went above and beyond at our disposal  Edsel at the Sunset Sports Bar. Paul, Adrianna and Manolitte who made the perfect mojito for the wife (less sugary) at The View Lobby all were accommodating and engaging. We shared a good laugh!  The infinity pool is one of the best we have seen,  well maintained and clean. Everyone has amazing smile to share. Although the location is out of the way, it will only take you 12-15 mins drive to Mactan Newtown.

The OK stuff: My wife has difficulty making a reservation to drive direct business in the hope they would do price match from a 3rd party booking site,  sadly every attempt was denied and so we ended up booking via Agoda. The Breakfast team was very attentive on our 1st & 2nd day, not unitl my wife had breakfast on her own and pretty much was ignored. No one came to ask ""can i get you some coffee"" or ""would you like some water"". I believe this needs to be address and educate staff further to deliver equal customer service, regardless of the stature. Please also look into the bar fridge's temperature.

Dusit Thani, which translates to ‚ÄúTown in Heaven‚Äù,  is a Thai owned resort, integrating Thai culture with the local Cebuana culture & people that makes for a beautiful blend for excellent hospitality that is focused to please resort guests from all over the world.

For my experience, All the resort‚Äôs personnel, from the concierge, front desk, housekeeping & room service, etc., Just to name a few, provided 5-star luxury customer service to fulfill and accommodate my requests to the best of their abilities 24/7.

However, one incident that was completely out of their control  BUT affected my balcony sea view  during my stay 10.10.22-10.14.22 as there was a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù cargo ship stuck in the coral beds near the beach line of the resort.  This was the unfortunate result of Super Typhoon Odette (Dec. 16, 2021) that directly hit the island of Cebu.

When I mentioned this to the front desk staff, I was fortunate to talk face to face with the Duty Mgr. Cecille Jane U. Aristan and she completely understood my point of view and was determined to make my stay more enjoyable despite the cargo ship ‚Äúeye-sore‚Äù on the property beachfront.

Within a few minutes, Cecille invited me & family members to experience the VIP Dusit Club Lounge for the remainder of my stay and it was fabulous! The attentive waiter/Bartender staff (Gerson Purgatorio, Kevin Labay) and chefs (Rufa Mae Soria, Irise Sheila Tagnipes, Kent Jules Deovino) were excellent providing the best customer service experience I‚Äôve had on this Cebu Trip!

I would also like to give a shout out to the Concierge (Earvin) and the Activities Staff (Jade, Cindy) for arranging such a wonderful tour of Cebu City & Mactan where we enjoyed learning about the local culture & historical points. (Lapu-Lapu monument, Guitar Factory, Taoist Temple,The Heritage of Cebu Monument, Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, 10,000 roses, etc.)

In closing, I would recommend this 5-star resort to my friends & family as well as other world travelers that are up to experiencing a once in a lifetime stay in beautiful, beachfront Cebu, Philippines.  I look forward to my return trip and stay @ the Dusit Thani as well as another invite to the fabulous Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu resort & their VIP Dusit Club lounge (Make it happen Cecille!! : ) in the near future after all renovations have been completed!

864360215,"I came back for the second time at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu Resort de-stress and relax for 3 days and 2 nights, and indeed my stay was again amazing. From Manila, I flew to Cebu via Cebu Pacific Airlines,. And, after an hour, I finally arrived in Cebu.

During my stay, I chose ""Club Deluxe King Sea View"". And, it was at The Club Lounge I had a check-in where Club Privileges I experienced. Daily buffet breakfast (630am to 1030am), Express check-out service, All-day refreshments including coffee, tea, and selected juices, Afternoon-Tea (230pm to 430pm). Evening cocktails  (530pm to 730pm), Wireless connectivity at the lounge. 

In the evening, I had an amazing dinner at ""Benjarong Restaurant""; where you can indulge in a true Thai experience at the newest and most exciting Thai restaurant in the Visayas. Benjarong features a blend of traditional taste and modern culinary technique, prepared before you in an open kitchen.  The next day, I had a good buffet breakfast at Tradewinds Cafe where I enjoyed a lot of amazing pastries and buffet international flavors. 

Right after, I chillax at the pool and then had a good lunch (buffet) at The Sports Bar, where you can relax on the deck sipping sunset drinks, playing billiards, catching the big game, and enjoying live entertainment.  Then, in the afternoon, I had an amazing one-hour Spa treatment at ""Namm Spa""; which I'm so recommending especially if you want to destress.

In the evening, I had nice evening drinks at the Club Lounge; where I also enjoyed canapes and finger foods. The next day, had an amazing Breakfast and Afternoon Tea again at the Club Lounge before my flight.

After 3 days 2 nights stay, I really had an amazing time here, and definitely I will go back to Cebu, and will relax and destress at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu Resort, and with Club Lounge Access again. Definitely worth it.",5,2022-10-13
863270033,"Had a wonderful meal at the Thai restaurant newly opened September 2022. Everything was delicious.  The meal started with a complimentary signature drink personally served by Reyniel who provided excellent service and care throughout the meal. 

I also had a mocktail cucumber basil slush drink.... Very refreshing. 

Then a spicy shrimp salad. Very tasty but I was expecting a salad with more lettuce. It would be better labeled as an appetizer due to limited lettuce. 

My main dish was green curry chicken. Excellent spice and tasty. 

I recommend this place as a great place to go. I was here after sunset but with the windows facing the city and mountains to the west I believe it will be a great view.

861310332,"I do not know where to start as day after day the level of the experience is decreasing ‚Ä¶
First you have to know that the hotel is under renovation works and no announcement at booking time‚Ä¶in the room because they give me one at the level of renovation, on going job can be heard‚Ä¶do you expect that ? 
Second they have decide to off the water without notice ‚Ä¶we do not care to find a shower somewhere but at least to inform the client ‚Ä¶(due to renovation works ‚Ä¶)
Despite all efforts the personal at restaurant is not so experimented (pandemic has killed everywhere) then asking you 3 times your room number or orders ?!?! Is it what we expect from this supposed category of hotel !? 
Btw the quality of the ID finishing is poor many defaults catching the eyes despite an overall picture that will satisfy the eyes but do not look so close‚Ä¶
The sport room  won‚Äôt accommodate more than 10 personnes or you won‚Äôt feel confortable 
Going to the food it is a mixed experience but room service is weak, always something missing, the sunset bar is average when waiting your dishes do not push you to leave without eating (happen to me today after 45mn waiting for a salad and a wrap while the occupation is quiet normal ‚Ä¶ 
Honestly I can understand a lot but without having a strong exigence the hotel is worst 4 stars but not 5 in these actual conditions, I won‚Äôt recommend it for the time and hope that it will improve a lot.

858284623,"We stayed here for 4 days booking a premium club lounge room and summer staycation package. This hotel has several issues the first being a lack of communication. They did not inform us that the club lounge would be closed for the duration of our stay (in other words we paid premium for a service which the hotel knew they wouldn't be delivering and they had not notified us about it either. Secondly upon arrival our initial email said to check-in at the club lounge however we were told it was closed and to wait at reception in 28-30 degree hear we waited 30mins at reception as the hotel had only 3 staff serving a long line of 12-15 people and strangely they did not have a single fan in the whole reception area - quite shocking for a hotel that calls themselves a ""5-star"" hotel, in my books it was more like a 3-star hotel. However that wasn't even the worst part. From day 1 all the way to day 4, we had to constantly remind the staff that we had booked a special package inclusive of drinks and canap√©s and everytime we went to redeem it, none of the staff knew what was going on, each time we wasted 20-30mins explaining our package to the staff, which was 20-30mins less of being able to claim our limited 2 hours of happy hour. Furthermore, ordering any food or drinks involved a consistent 45-60min wait for it to arrive. Whilst there were 15 wait staff standing around doing nothing only one was making drinks, either the staff are unqualified or the hotel doesn't want to pay to train their staff. Either way this meant you could only have a max of 3 drinks in any happy hour session as the bartender was not capable of making any more than that. Furthermore, the room that the hotel had given us on the first night was not the premium king sized room we had booked. Instead it was a room facing the slums of Cebu. The staff failed to tell us that because we had arrived 30mind early our room was unavailable and instead without any communication whatsoever they placed us in a smaller room facing the slums rather than the premium room we booked facing the pool and spa. Mind you this all happened in just the first four hours of our stay but it certainly set the tone for the rest of the trip. On day 2, first thing we did was contact reception to speak to the manager about all these issues, it was not until then that the manager told us that our room was unavailable only because we arrived 30mins early and that's why they placed us in a smaller room which was not the room that we booked. The manager gave us a 30% discount at the spa however this only involved spending more money to redeem that. We note that the manager did not respond or address any of the other issues at the hotel. Food at the hotel was heavily overpriced for the quality and service, a mere burger and fries for 2 and two cocktails costed us around $65AUD. In Australia this kind of food is usually less than $40AUD and is of gourmet quality unlike at this hotel. The most annoying thing above all was having to constantly carry cash around to pay each restaurant at the hotel and we felt that staff wouldn't serve you within 40mins unless they received a tip and sometimes even if they did it wouldn't guarantee fast service. Finally, the only perk of the hotel is it's infinity pool however most of the time all the seats by the pool are full as they also allow day guests and often towels run out too. Will definitely not be visiting this hotel or Cebu ever again.",1,2022-09-03

853778053,"The property is old and there is a lot of renovation work going on in the resort. The rooms were smelly and I had to get them to clean the bathroom twice as the bathroom floor was not cleaned well before we could check in . There is some open drain in the room which was quite smelly . I have a feeling it is from the sink in the kitchen area . Furniture is old , and nothing fancy to call the room 5 star resort . The bathroom door doesn‚Äôt close well , so the water kept coming out of the shower enclosure and messing up the other area . The food options are very limited , and their specialty restaurant was quite a disappointment with respect to the taste of the food . The staff everywhere was quite welcoming and warm though . 
The room service was taking forever . Even a bottle of water takes 15 mins at least to get delivered . The bottles of water they provide are 350 ml and you would end up taking more of those bottles as they are too small . Being such a big brand , they have not been environmentally conscious . They are on using small single use plastic bottles for everything.  It is unacceptable . Would make more sense yo have a water purification plant on the premises or use bigger bottles to give water . The cost of everything is unreasonably expensive for no damn reason . And they are all excluding VAT which is something new we saw. 
The just got my period and needed a sanitary pad and they were going to charge me 100 pesos for one pad . I got furious with this . 

We stayed at Radisson blue for two days before this and moved there to have a nice resort feel . But Radisson was 1000 times better in every aspect . Costed lesser , better service , better food , amazing rooms and room service . 

Would recommend not to go the Dusit Thani . They are just trying to over charge for everything without any reason .",1,2022-08-13
853245352,"We went to Cebu and stayed at the Dusit Thani, the hotel was good but some works were being carried out due the damage from the recent hurricane (I think).
The hotel itself was big though in my opinion a little secluded and out of the way. If you want to stay here and get around then hire a car or scooter, we hired a scooter so was good for us, if you just want to stay and relax then all good.
The swimming pool excellent with great views. There was a boat not so far from the hotel that had been washed up by the recent hurricane which I‚Äôm sure will be salvaged soon enough. The staff were great and friendly though I did find it strange that we had to inform reception to have our room made up daily.
Food at the hotel was decent and the breakfast was buffet style depending how busy the hotel was, a few times during our stay the breakfast was Ala carte and the breakfast location changing due to the hotel not being so busy during the week days.
The bedroom was fine and spacious with a pool view and cleaned daily once reception had been notified, the rooms were also quite modern with the usual refinements expected from a Dusit Thani Hotel.",4,2022-08-10

847307723,"The hotel is at the end of a peninsula on Mactan island and pretty much isolated from rest of metro Cebu. The room was fine‚Ä¶nice sea view with balcony. King  size bed was really comfortable. The quirky bathroom had a shower with separate tub and no door leaving a wet mess in front of sink. 
The lobby, dining areas, huge infinity pool and beach were really appealing. Considering the devastation of the recent typhoon they have made quite a comeback.
Now, I give it just 3-stars because of food and service. The breakfast buffet was very good‚Äînice assortment of breads, meats, fresh fruit and eggs dishes. Meal Service  was mostly quick and friendly. The other meals were off the menu and were bland and way overpriced. For example the ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù salad was a concoction of chopped up tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers with barely visible feta cheese and olives served warm. 
Room service in this caliber of resort should be performed daily without request but it was not‚Äîeven when requested.
Other missteps included charging our 9 yo for breakfast buffet when it was including in the booking; charging my Visa card in US dollars when Pesos were specifically requested resulting in an exchange skewed in their favor; telling us, in front of our visiting relative, that we must pay 1000 Pesos because she went in the pool.

I would have given them 3-stars if not for the exceptional guest service extended by duty manager John who saved the situation for us. Hats off as well to Shinji and Alona of the Lobby Bar, both are some of the best I've encountered! I also hope that Dusit management enforces a strict policy on swimwear. Some guests are too conscious and maybe conservatives that they swim wearing street clothing like dresses and cotton shirts and basketball shorts! Who knows how much bacteria those stuff bring in the water. They also allow daytrippers which invade the poolside during weekends leaving hotel guests no space to lounge and relax. Its a really nice hotel, except for the hordes of daytrippers during the weekend. The staff and service are really good too!",4,2022-04-23
835637566,"I booked for 3 days n 2 nights deluxe seaview for Holy week, on the day of our booking the check in time is 3pm there is queuing   in the front desk, when it was my turn to check in the front desk said that the room was not yet ready its for fogging they will call us if its ready,the clock is ticking  i follow up it after 1 hour they said its for final checking, another 1 hr pass, they never call us instead i approach the front desk. @ 5pm the room was ready they give us the key card but take note no Apology in their aside why it took 2 hours for  me and my family to check in , aside from that after giving key card no assist to in our room. Upon settling in the room i was disappointed for the view i tot it will be purely sea view, the so expensive deluxe sea view  room my view is sky deck and seaview, immediately after i ask the front desk for 6 times that if there is available room for pool n seaview room will transfer and willing to add payment, the front desk said they will find a way an inform us but sadly no feedback from them at all happen.. on the 2nd day i request for replenish of toiletries and new towel the housekeeping took more than 1 hour to give it and apologize why it took so long and said  he is very busy cleaning rooms since in 1 building there is only 1 housekeeper assigned, that the real reason why its took us 2 hours delay in check in not the fogging or final check up happen‚Ä¶in breakfast buffet they served ang crispy bangus which is almost spoiled and itchy in the tongue to eat ,luckily my husband 1st try to eat before me cause i will be in trouble if  i eat that since i did not bring my medicine for allergy, 2 days breakfast buffet i did not enjoy and afraid to eat. In the pool area the lifeguard/towel in charge has no manners at all he will ask you a lot of question before giving you towels and the worst is he just cough in front of us.. the worst and yuckiest thing in this hotel is the playzone for kids when we go there so that my kids could play i expected they sell socks but the incharge said its out of stock and suggested the he has use socks if we are willing to use it, super gross .. the said they are 5 stars but they service is very very poor .. not good for 1 star at all.. if your planning for vacation in mactan avoiding this resort at all not worthy of your money.. i been to crimson, jpark, shang,etc etc dusit is very far in terms of service and manners..",1,2022-04-22
835554678,"We brought our family here last March to celebrate my brother's birthday and it was definitely a birthday to remember.

The views, the accommodation and staff were great. Special mention to Relly who really gave us his attention and did his best to provide every need of our family during lunch time. He was professional and courteous towards us the entire time. We were a big group with 3 senior citizens and a baby so you can imagine we were needing assistance most of the time, yet he and a few of his workers didn't show any sign of complaint or annoyance and just focused on assisting us. 

Safety measures against COVID were well-placed as a staff was assigned by the buffet to spray alcohol on our hands before eating, and we were required to wear plastic gloves while getting food so as to not contaminate the serving spoons, ladles, etc. Food trays were always full and the lines didn't get too long as they were managing it to avoid crowding the buffet area.

Beach was nice, the salty air and the serene summer view of the sea while chilling in the pool was so relaxing. Lifeguards were strict and were implementing pool rules properly so that was really well appreciated. Both kids and adults enjoyed their time in the sun despite going home with sunburnt skins. 

Overall a lovely experience and we would definitely come back again!",5,2022-04-22

Despite some areas needing repair due to typhoon odette, hotel provides a spacious lobby lounge, amazing widespace infinity pool that is super social distance-friendly.

Highly commend Imea from at the sunset resto. Superb and personalized service from her. She saw me carrying my baby while getting food for breakfast and surprisingly offered to get me my food while i hold my baby.  At lunch, we found the pad thai to be super spicy and she kindly replaced the dish with lesser spice. Hope she gets to read this post and know that she is appreciated.

Downside of the hotel: very very limited food options, same menu offered, No kid's menu available. Garden view room balconies are exposed to neighboring residents. Beach is too small. 

Overall still had a great time at the hotel. ",4,2022-04-08

The typhoon and so there were limited options around. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Unfortunately for food there was only 1 menu available at the time of our stay so it was sports bar food for lunch and dinner for 3 nights :(. The pool was great and the beach was nice too. The kids club was a bit of a let down - not totally open and you have to pay per hour, but I was told that there was no air con inside it ‚Äòdue to Covid ?‚Äô and so didn‚Äôt use it (it was one of the reasons I chose this hotel). Also I didn‚Äôt like wearing plastic gloves for breakfast buffet as they are actually rather pointless, and also hugely damaging for the environment. If you look around the Philippines coming here there is plastic trash littered around everywhere and I don‚Äôt think we need to be adding to the problem here of plastic waste.

I was impressed with the view upon entering the lobby, great panorama of the sea since the resort is located at the tip of Mactan. There was still some structural damage from the typhoon last Dec 2021, for instance a ceiling leak in the room, but this was immediately resolved when we notified the front desk. Given its location, the restaurants were able to provide sufficient variety. The staff were very helpful and answered our needs promptly. I would consider coming back.",4,2022-04-04

Hours later, we didn't realize how the heat touching us and  thanks to Sir Relly who was very attentive and sensitive to our needs, when he had to open up the umbrella  to give us shade without telling him, though it was a simple act, yet, it was very helpful to us, Salute to you Sir Relly!.  We love watching the infinity pool up to the ocean. The view is really breathtaking it helps us think and clear our mind and do brainstorming, .

830652463,"Was super excited to visit this hotel after a year away from my Family 
What a disappointment!!!
The hotel
It‚Äôs self is in a bad way the damage from the typhoon last year has not been addressed instead there are miles of Caution tape everywhere reception is at a makeshift desk handrails are missing from walkways and from stairs.

Check in was as unpleasant as the building it‚Äôs self
No greeting no smile very much pushing to upsell and upgrade.

Once at the room we were shocked at the fact it was so unclean and the smell of urine emanating from the bathroom was disgusting 
This was brought up with housekeeping and the manager but to no avail and we were left to clean the room and bathroom ourselves.

The pool is nice but unfortunately someone had vomited in the kiddie end which was never cleaned during the day after bringing it to the staff attention 

During breakfast there was no decaf coffee available unless you pay extra no tea available unless you pay extra.
The staff in the restaurant are very good and very helpful especially Imee who tried so hard to help and make everything rite.

There seems to be a lack of customer care with the management and the feeling is to upsell at every opportunity.

Having spoken with the manager twice regarding the concerns it was decided it‚Äôs better we move to a different hotel which he had no objection to and quickly cancelled the remaining days of our stay.

Very unprofessional approach to guests and unfortunately this is what is been fed down through the staff.

It pains me to have to write such a bad review but feel it is important to share the experience with others.

Hopefully this can be addressed and this hotel can reach the standards of other Hotels in the Dusit Thani Group",1,2022-03-09
830225341,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 

The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness. Props to Matthew who checked us in very quickly at 9PM when we arrived.

The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entrees though need to have more variety. I ordered the inasal and it was excellent. So were the frozen mojitos. 

Their famous Thai restaurant Benjarong was closed due to repairs from the typhoon. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant.  There is a buffet available at one of the restaurant but since we are still living in the time of COVID, I thought is would not be prudent to do so. There is a deli that serves good coffee and okay sandwiches. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the shoreline of property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom in our room though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

The resort is located on the far end of Mactan Island so be prepared to stay in because it's far away from everything else. My daughter and I stayed in for three days and two nights and we did not get bored. 

Over-all rating -- 3.5 to 4",4,2022-03-06

826741893,"Following the destruction of Odette and living near the Dusit we needed somewhere to stay as power, water and comms were all down and the road was blocked with numerous tress and concrete poles down - we were really in a n bad position. As I walked round early morning talking with fellow residents and staff and working out what we could do I thought I would see if the Dusit was open and much to my relief and surprise they were looking at taking some people in despite damage to parts of the hotel ...a number of us checked in with an indefinite exit date until our places were back up and running which ended up taking a month or so. 

I cannot  thank nor praise the GM , Michael and all of the Dusit team where despite the difficult circumstances they made our 'refugee - like' stay a complete pleasure and I was hugely impressed with how they pulled off memorable Christmas and New Year Eve parties with great food and good humour - much needed antidotes to the ongoing challenges with the tidy up, restoring power and water runs required  on the domestic front.

I got to know th the team very well and the warmth and kindness as well as service made my stay feel like a second family and I am very grateful for all their support and help. 

In times of crisis you really get to see how people are and to a man/woman the Dusit truly stepped up and will be forever in memory as a shining light during difficult times.

Thanks Michael and your team! and will be seeing you soon...",5,2022-02-03

We had just come from a required post overseas trip quarantine period in another hotel in Cebu City but as luck would have it couldn‚Äôt go home because one of two house guests had covid. So we opted to have a staycation by the sea and decided to try the Dusit to wait out the Big O visiting my home. It was a great decision. We had such a feeling of space and freshness. Our Seaview room was very comfortable and we spent part of every afternoon by the 100m long pool.  And the food was very good too! So all in all I have to say that I would love to staycation at the Dusit again and I will.,5,2022-02-03
