12121217,"Friday dinner at Tradewinds Cafe was a big dissapointment. The shrimp used in the sinigang was not fresh. The baked whole fish was dry. There were flies inside the restaurant. The baked pork loin needed to be marinated well. Unhappy at the quality of the food for the price of 2,000 pesos per person. Worst of all there was no Thai dishes for a purported Thai Hotel. The staff were accomodating and friendly. Kudos to the staff.",3.0,2024-06-09

9138617,"I do not have a good experience in Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu. First and foremost, the staff wrote Mr before my name. And they know for sure all Maria in the Phils are females. Besides, i gave my PRC card at the check in counter and for sure Mr Erickson saw me female in flesh. But why, in the big screen I am MR. MARIA PRESA APARIS (pics attached). 2. Mr. Erickson at the check in counter said, the extra bed will be set up later. I said no worries because we will not sleep yet but will take a dip in the pool. Sad to say, we came back to the room after 4 hours and my bed is not fix yet. I still have to call and  follow it up. We are 3 in the room but only given 1 shampoo, 1 lotion, 1 liquid soap, no face towel and only 1 hand towel. Mr Erickson at the front desk said the high tea will be at 4:30-5:30pm at the mezzanine floor. But when we reach Mezzanine at 4:30pm women at the front said it starts 2:30pm-4:30pm. Why is it your crew does not have a consistent answer. When I heard those 2 answers inconsistencies i was like "" so this means i will be eating leafovers"".Worst because the suppose Mezzanine lounge was close and we are transferred to have the high tea at the view lounge.Mr. Paul at the view lounge said that the mezzanine was close because only a few of the residents will have high tea. And what frustrates me is the very long waiting time for the suppose high tea. I said suppose high tea because what was served is not a high tea set up.The suppose unlimited cocktail is also set in the view lounge. And upon check in, Mr Erickson said that in the  unlimited cocktail lots of food will be serve as well that you wont crave for dinner. With this being said, my expectations were so high most especially that I just came from Pearl Farm Resort in Davao and I know Dusit is at par with Pearl and the service there were so great. So sad to say, my expectations perilously drop when after more than 3 hours of waiting our food is not serve.The beach time is set until 5pm and they only have 2 umbrellas with no shades at all to hide under the scorching heat of the sun.Together with me is a senior citizen and sad to say its not elderly friendly area.The pool towels are old yet the incharge does not allow me to bring it to our room. I got angry and said, ""you want me to go up to my room wet and water dripping in the elevator floor? "" He replied, because we still need to wash that one Mam"". what a reason. In Pearl Farm, their towels are new, and very soft. Yet after using I asked, where will I place this? the crew answered, just place it there Mam and we will be the one to get it. I am making this review for them to improve their service. More so to have a good review and encourage more people to come or be back to the place. It is so sad to note that they have a instagrammable view but the service does not reach to our expectation. Credit to Jomar at the view lounge who really did his best to please us. The breakfast though is so good and they sang happy birthday to my uncle. Big thanks.",3.8,2023-09-08

7772080,Waiting in reception queues for 40 minutes. Cold buffet breakfast and cold meals in the sunset bar. Thai restaurant is lovely but feels like you are at a completely different hotel. TV did not work in the room. Waited 40 minutes to come to the room before someone came up and laughed and said they were all down in Mactan. Went to another hotel for dinner and the TVs all seemed to work there. Asked for a cake and card for my sisters room on arrival which was confirmed it would be done and was not,2.0,2022-12-30
