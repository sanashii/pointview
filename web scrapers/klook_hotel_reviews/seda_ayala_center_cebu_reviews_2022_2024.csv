9458767,"Place is very accessible and just beside the mal so it‚Äôs easier to find places to eat and shop. But since this is near the mall, I can hear from my room the karaoke from the bar/restaurant. Rooms are clean and staff are very accommodating. Although room walls are quite thin, I can hear when furnitures were being moved or if someone is cleaning in the other room.",4.3,2023-10-31

Very close to Ayala Mall. Very convenient and the breakfast buffet is quite good.  Overall experience, I had a good relaxation staycation alone. I slept well and the best is so comfy.

I saved a lot of money and enjoy it with my family in staying in seda hotel.",4.8,2022-11-22
7540862,My room was overlooking a rubble on top of the roof. Not a nice view. I use to stay here when it was Marriot and I can tell that it has gone downhill since it was rebranded into Seda hotel. I got annoyed as I got a courtesy call even though I turned on the DND - I was sleeping. The location is superb as it‚Äôs just next to Ayala Mall. Generally okay.,4.0,2022-11-08
7453321,Big lobby. Clean rooms. Friendly front desk and staff. Near the mall and has an access to the mall. Will stay here again when we go back to Cebu.,5.0,2022-10-13
7118789,"No promos were acknowledged from Klook (dining credits/upgrades/early-late checkout). Standard hotel. Not much of a thrill. Coffee and tea are generic which I find cheap. The walls were too thin. I can hear neighbors and other guests. Bad breakfast- Pancake and bacon weren't edible at all, this is my honest review. 

The only thing that's a saving grace of the hotel is its convenience to mall access and location. The rest, it's a normal hotel.",4.0,2022-06-29
7102725,A good place right at the heart of the city. Just a few steps from the mall and restaurants. The front desk staff are very accommodating.,5.0,2022-06-23
7102060,Place is close to the mall. The only drawback is there is a bar that has loud music every night until 11pm. Maybe midnight on weekends which you can hear a little in your room if facing Ayala mall. Otherwise its a nice place to stay. This used to be the Marriott Hotel.,5.0,2022-06-23
7024922,A great place to stay when you're in Cebu city. The staff are so friendly and accommodating. Especially the location because it's really close to ayala mall. can't wait to be back super soon.,5.0,2022-05-21
