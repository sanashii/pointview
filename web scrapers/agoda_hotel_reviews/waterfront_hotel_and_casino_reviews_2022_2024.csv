824862054,"What happens when a great hotel becomes a shell of itself? It becomes the waterfront. It is a real unfortunate thing. Using a booking agency to book my visit, I had to change my check in date, instead of being helpful, they just accepted me paying a night I wasn't there. No recourse, they hide behind the booking agency. Then they say they charge 1000 a night, but try to go to the bar at the pool with no cash, nope, you can pay for the room, but not for a beer after swimming. Utter stupidity. Then my daughter must have gotten out one of the waters so when I check out, I got charged for that (no worries, but duh, you couldn't have done that out at the pool bar? Lastly, half the swimming pool is roped off because the overhanging structure that was falling down 3 years ago is still falling down. Definitely the eyesore of the whole place. Smelly elevators (one we started calling the ""pee"" vator) and you have to walk to the lower level to pick up grab and of course the escalator is still broken (I think it was broken 3 years ago). It must be expensive to run the waterfront, but they need a tune up to justify the cost of this once amazing hotel.

818761457,"The hotel is an older hotel whch is fine the lobby areas are pretty well kept as this is whats on show but behind the scenes it was a different story in the room. Very poorly maintained, old and quite dingy . The armoire that housed the tv was broken, with cracked wood and chipped paint all over. How Housekeeping or Engineering cant see this is beyond me or the hotel does not want to spend the money for repair but a simple paint job would have improved it immensly .. We checked out after 2 days as the water was COLD the entire stay so cold showers were the go and bathroom fixtures were tired and worn. Ordered in the lobby bar what was detailed as Nachos but was just nacho chips and salsa.. Would have been much better to detail as that on the menu to avoid dissapointment . It was around Christmas time we stayed (yes this review is a bit late) and you can see a lot of time and effort was put into the decrations and the large Christmas tree which we must say was excellent and a lot of time, effort & money was put in. ..If half as much effort was put into maintaining the rooms as the public ""SHOW"" areas then the review would be lot better sorry to say.. Also unfortunatley our room was directly overlooking a truck junk yard which in 3 decades of travelling the globe was probably the worst view i have ever had.. While i assume this is out of hotels reach to fix they should at least try and work out something with the owners of the that property to clean it up (maybe a Barter Deal or something similiar ) and at least if you are placed overlooking this shocking view it would have been nice to be  be forewarned or upgraded .. Sorry to say but short of the Xmas decorations beng spectacular the rest of the stay was far from that.

It was insulting that they did not initially believe that there was no dried mangoes in the mini bar upon checkin in the room. 

In front of you, that the receptionist  had to confirm and call their people if there was a dried mango or not in the mini bar. 

It took awhile to confirm and decided to not charge
me and just waived it. She returned still the full 1k security deposit but the receipt that she had me signed was 800 pesos and still in the record there was a charge of 200 pesos for the dried mango which we did not even get from the mini bar. 

There was no true confirmation, it seems like we just waived it but just still sign this receipt. 

I hate it when u are accused
and there
was
no confirmation that it was their facilities who made an incompetency of not refilling their mini bars and resulted in charging customers of a mistake made by their personnel. 

There was not even an apology provided when she returned my full 1k deposit. It seems like she did not believe me as a customer.

It is not 5 star hotel, too expensive for what it is supposed to worth. For the money being charged, the hotel should do something about the rooms.

The staff at the reception, housekeeping, and the room service were all very helpful and efficient with their work. However, the reservations team were not very attentive and sensitive to my needs. I requested an early check-in on the day that I was booked because I had to have my hair and make-up done for the wedding but was just told in the email to just rock up early on the day and  my request would be considered depending on the availability of the room. They could have given me a definite answer which is either yes or no.

798082661,"During my recent stay at the hotel, several issues marred what could have otherwise been a satisfactory experience. Despite my booking specifying a king-size bed, I was provided a smaller size, and the staff did not address this issue satisfactorily when I raised it. The Wi-Fi service was almost non-existent in my room, and the only solution offered was to use the equally poor connection in the lobby.The advertised soundproof rooms were anything but, as I could clearly hear housekeeping staff and other guests in the hallways. Additionally, the lack of a business center and advertised shuttle service to the airport were significant inconveniences, forcing me to print documents at the front desk—where they charged a fee per page—and arrange my own transportation to the airport.The gym facilities were unsafe; a missing knob replaced with tape on equipment resulted in a minor injury. This lack of attention to detail and the overall management's indifference to resolving issues significantly detracted from the overall quality of my stay.

It wasn’t fantastic but it wasn’t bad the breakfast buffet was outstanding. I probably wouldn’t stay there again, because like I said, my primary reason for staying there was because the American consulate is on the ground floor of the building and I had an appointment at 8 AM that I had to be at. I think the hotel is more geared towards the local community with events and banquet facilities not for tourists. That being said if you have an appointment at the American consulate you can’t go wrong.

The walls and doors are so thin that I could hear everything in the hallways that first day I must have gotten up at least 4 times to check who was knocking at my door only to realize it was someone down the hall and I was treated to every word of the housekeeping staffs conversation.

The hotel itself have cafes and restaurant, so you can easily eat there and relax, without having to go out. The price is quite expensive since it is a luxury hotel.

756987897,"The hotel is impeccably clean. Breakfast buffet was very good with many choices for each type of dish, would recommend. 

The bathroom in our room had a bathtub which was good but no bidet which was bad. The bathtub, however, was smaller than bathtubs in other hotels such as Montebello. The hotel did not immediately provide bathrobes and slippers except by request, and requesting was difficult because the phone lines were down for maintenance.

Wifi was slow and full of restrictions; I was unable to use my Mi Box to watch my streaming services on the TV because of this. 

Staff are generally attentive to customer needs. However, I had one instance where the girl at the FO didn't understand my request for bathrobes and slippers even after I explained that the phone was down for maintenance.

The 4ft-deep pool was wide and nicely placed. The pool area had an unsightly barrier due to some damage or construction on what I assumed was a slide that was situated above the pool.

We attended the New Year's Countdown party and buffet, both of which were not worth the amount paid for (approx ₱4200 per head for 2 pax or 75 USD) but were otherwise decent.

Overall this is a decent place to stay because of its proximity to Ayala Center and IT Park, but Montebello Hotel which isn't far from here has a better breakfast for less, more expansive hotel grounds and bigger bathtubs in the rooms.

Consider Waterfront over other alternatives if you prefer the ornate decor and furniture of older hotels and want a spot that has good access to many different food places and tourist attractions.

I’d like to commend everyone who’s been there to assist us most especially the night shift Manager on duty who was very accommodating to assist us even when it’s already 3am. My daughter needed water since she’s being bothered by her cough that night. The hotel lines were under repair that time and we can’t call housekeeping directly. The hotel manager on duty had immediately sent someone to deliver the water we need.  I’m looking forward to stay again in this hotel soon.

Parking staff and parking security @5pm 12/9 shift: They asked us to inform the concierge to put the validation # for the parking ticket the next time we go out of the hotel or the next day before we check out. Is that how you treat your guests? Or you're just selective based on what type of car your guest is driving? That was not our fault if the validation ticket had the incomplete information!!! Don't ask your guests to do something that could resolve your problem which was only caused by your other staff!!!!! The next day we checked out using the same validation ticket, there was no question about it!!!

now the dolphins are missing from the pool ... just the stand is there ... the walkway around the pool is all broken and uneven .. concrete is broken everywhere .. even the back of the pool green netting is there to catch falling concrete and a section of pool is closed to to falling debris .. the pool are no now no smoking area provided .. on the 15 plus acres only a very small area near hall is provided ... lobby is still good .. only renos is the elevators and they are still not finished ... 

rooms are as old as the hotel .. and very poor lighting .. oh and yes nooooooo hot water all 3 days there .. only room temperature water coming out day or night ..

one good thing .. they didnt have my room ready for early check in that i asked for .. they wanted me to upgrade my room to get that .. when i complained they had manager change my room to a deluxe which did not seem any different then my original room .. maybe because it was on the 15 floor its deluxe ... was still a basic room ... 

breakfast was definitely downgraded from 2019 .. many things missing .. the scrambled eggs 2 days in a row where empty and not refilled told to go to egg station ... when i only wanted the scrambled and had to wait long time for the egg station to make ... 

wont be going back ... stay at Maayo or somewhere else like the Ayala hotel downtown ...

They didn't even inform us about the parking or anything. Our booking said check-in was 3 PM and we checked in at 3:15 but there was no room ready. It doesn't make sense.

Since my sister and I just put our bags in the room when we entered, we didn't notice that the A/C was broken. When we got back, we realized how hot the room was and had to transfer to another room at literally 2 AM without any compensation whatsoever. Also, all the furniture was old and the design is so outdated. The wifi was also useless. I connected but it wouldn't even let me go online. What's the point? 

Since we were on a high floor, the view of the city was nice but very limited.

686051901,"We made a reservation for 3 adults for 3 days using Agoda platform with all the freebies (free breakfast, free wifi, free parking, etc) checked and included.  When we arrived, the hotel records only shows 2 adults, and breakfast is NOT included, etc.   We verbally expressed our complaints and the hotel staff told us to call Agoda and file the complaint.  Their explanation is that, Agoda assigned the booking to another travel booking agency and in the process the freebies and number of booked adults were changed.

In short, we were assigned an old room, with 2 single beds, with old carpet, that smell nauseating and ended up paying for extra for everything.

Agoda call it a good deal but it's not a good deal at all! 

Shall, I blame Agoda and never use that platform again or don't recommend this hotel and will not stay here again? That is my assessment. 😒

Staff in hotel, very polite and kind, professional. Always smile.

Breakfast is really good. Many kinds of food and delicious but some of local style foods are salty.

If you order food from lobby lounge bar, they don't have space to cook so they take food from main resto but fries, they take from Buffett so it's not crispy. 

Gym and pool are good. Gym is old, machines are also but it works fine.

Casino is good but many hookers there with tourists and i know guard cannot stop them because tourists always say she is my wife or girl.

Their tour service is very expensive. 
I booked taxi through hotel to danao port. I paid 3800peso but if you get taxi yourself, it's around 1500-2000peso. But through hotel, you don't need to get stress from negotiations. 
I would recommend this hotel to my friends also i myself for next time, definently use this hotel.

The thermostat in the room doesn't work, it's just a wall decoration; though to be fair, it didn't get too hot in the room unlike in the lobby. The facilities are also old. When you flush the toilet, it bubbles up a bit (with some splash) before it goes down, and the suction is not good. The shower causes a mess in the bathroom because it's still an old model. There is also no exhaust in the bathroom. The only good thing about this hotel is the staff, i guess. They're very professional and accommodating. I only stayed here because I attended an event. We had no aircon during the whole event so we were dying inside the venue. They said they had a blackout and were only using generators but when we got back in our hotel room, there was aircon so I don't know how true their excuse is. Anyway, if I'm not attending an event here, I definitely would NOT stay here again. Even the lower end hotels have better facilities, and they're much cheaper too. Hope Waterfront's management steps up and actually renovate their old establishment.

It's just a ripoff with the price they're charging. My room DOES NOT have a poweroutlet except a single one in the far side of the wall, none within reach of your bed. The front desk crew took so long to check me in when I was the only guest checking in. The restaurant crew is very slow and taking forever with my order of just 2 items, which by the way is way too overpriced. I checked out next day and transferred to a nearby modern hotel with all the modern facilties and very reasonable rate.  I can't believe how the owners and management of this hotel neglected to update their hotel. Don't waste your money don't book this hotel.

During check in, their process and system is slow. You really have to have patience to be able to endure it. The room was clean and well organize.

If you are not ordering, you need to sit on the corner. Breakfast has good number of options but staff are not as attentive. No water were given at the table.

During our stay, the hotel was very busy, and on two consecutive days, breakfast facilities and choices declined due to the volume of clientèle. On two consecutive days, they ran out of basic food stuff, including  butter, tomatoes, and bacon, well before breakfast was due to end.

A few minutes walk will take you to I.T. Park.

Here are some of the but’s with my experience staying there:

- The internet needs updating and upgrading. Everywhere I am in the hotel, the WiFi keeps cutting off. Something that’s needs looking into.

- Staff members professionalism. Whilst I find the Receptionist who checked me in very friendly and helpful, I found the staff including the manager on duty somewhat unprofessional. When I was checking out, there was a guest who was charged for smoking in the room. This argument escalated whilst I was being dealt with for check out and this staff member was sounding very patronising to this guest and I actually felt very uncomfortable with the whole conversation considering I was being checked out and I am hearing all of this. I’m sorry, but the way the staff member spoke to the guest was so patronising. After this argument, I told the Duty manager who check me out that they need to ensure that when they have a dispute with another guest is to set them aside away from the other guest like me. I can tell the Duty manager didn’t have a care a world with what I said. He just said okay.  Not even an apology was given to me and not acknowledging the fact that it was inappropriate for them to be arguing in front of guests.

I was very put off with how they have been handling these situations. I come from a service background myself, and just found it an uncomfortable experience.

I complained to the duty manager 30 minutes later and all she said was it is  their SOP and she only worked there. Never again will i stay there.

574615006,"Pros: Lobby is beautiful.  Breakfast buffet is above average.  Cons: Staff shortage. There wasn't a bill hoo available when my taxi pulled in. One shower after me and my taxi driver loaded   the cart. Long line to checkout because they only had two people working the checkout counter.    The first room they gave me AC was broken ,phone had a bad connection,and the toilet didn't stop running after I flushed it. They upgraded the room to room 1410. The shower head was only 5'8"" high. I'm 6'1""  with a bad back and had to bend over to take a shower. Not very comfortable. It was difficult getting into and out of the shower as the bathtub was too high. I felt like I was jumping over a high hurtle. Old folks would have a rough time getting in and out for sure.  Plus the bathroom was small. The room was OK. However, the TV stand was low making it difficult to watch TV while laying on the bed. The room could have used a new paint job.  Location wasn't the greatest. You need to take a taxi to get to a mall or restaurant.  They do offer a shuttle that I took to Ayala Mall that runs at 10 am and will pick you up at 2 pm. I thought that was pretty good.

Requested for early check-in as we were arriving in the morning and had to attend a conference (held at the same hotel) at 1pm. Unfortunately, when we got there, the room wasn't available and had to wait for one to become available. Express check-in wasn't really ""express"". If that was express, I pity the ones who would have to experience the regular check-in experience.

The staff at the entrance were always helpful. Our room had a very nice view of the mountainous area which looked like it had fairy lights at night. The shower was faulty though. Still, we had a wonderful stay except for what happened during our last night. At around 3am, we heard some banging on the walls and the loud voices of a woman and a man. They were fighting in the hallway. I think the walls weren't thick enough to muffle their voices as I clearly heard what they were fighting about. I don't know who booked the room, but the woman didn't seem to have her key card with her and was begging to be let in. We were quite shaken being awakened at that hour. It continued for a few minutes. I think they resolved their issue in their room as it became quiet after a while. The elevators don't have a card tap system. The hotel is quite safe. But I think having one would increase the hotel's security.

526126268,"We have been frequent customers of Waterfront even as a kid (with parents), my recent stay in Waterfront was with my husband and here's what we observed

A. I appreciate that we were given the option to check in early. Unfortunately, the only available room was twin beds and I didnt want to wait 3 hours to check in. App stated check in time was 2 PM, staff said 3 PM.

B. We checked in around the time others were checking out so I understand the wait. Staff were friendly and accommodating

C. Room was comfortable. The AC worked, we had the hot and cold water option. However, I didnt like that you had to stand in the tub for you to shower. The tub drain looked like it still had some dirt and grime on it. I had to run it under hot water for quite some time. There was no bidet as well. 

D. Their TV definitely needs an upgrade too. Smart TVs are something that they can invest on. The wifi is pretty slow as well. It sucked that they had no slippers for the guests.

E. The bed is very comfortable. We slept really well.

Our overall stay given the price and experience was still good but there definitely is room for improvement. 

Would like to share one thing. Around 3 AM, someone knocked on our door. We were in the 3rd floor and we were woken up by someone knocking on our door. My husband asked who it was and the person on the other side replied, ""Nag room check ra mi, Sir.""

We're unsure if the said person was a legitimate employee or if otherwise. It still boggles me until this day who was on the other side as we were not expecting guests nor did we request for any service or housekeeping. Weird. Waterfront can maybe check out the footage and check who was knocking.

We have stayed in this hotel many times, but in the last 3 years have complained 3 times at Reception. 1st complaint we were upgraded, the 2nd complaint we were offered a free stay, which I had to decline because I was off home next day. The 3rd complaint is now - No TV in the room, Elevators breaking down, checking in at 11pm to find the room has no lights. I made the complaint and a young lady Manageress named ZEA or something like that took my complaint on board, waited until we left and then skipped it. She was supposed to follow up and reply to my email but she decided not to bother. It is a very poor way to treat a frequent customer and for that I will not return here anymore.

510619160,"We have stayed regularly at Waterfront over the last 10 years except for during 2020 and 2021 due to covid.
Generally, everything was very good as expected from previous stays, however I make the following observations:
The pool area needs an upgrade, especially exposed drainage channels with green algae.
I do like a cup of  English Breakfast tea with breakfast. Waterfront Uno restaurant provides EB tea in a large teapot on  a warming appliance.
Trouble is getting a decent cup of tea from that big pot is hit and miss as as it depends how long the teapot has been there.
After two days of luke warm cups of tea this time, I asked a waiter for a pot of tea to my table please.
The waiter replied, that will be an extra charge Sir. I said how long have you been working here? Waiter replied 2 months. Well I said I've been coming here for 10 years and never been charged for a pot of tea before.
From then on subsequent mornings waiters sometimes delivered freshly brewed pots of tea to my table without me asking, no extra charge.
But I found another way to get around it.  I simply took a  tea bag each day  to breakfast and went to the drink bar and asked for boiling water in my cup. Simple, no dramas.
The restaurant staff probably think asking for a pot of tea at your table is asking for special service.
No it's not. I simply wanted a decent cup of tea.  The general tea pot that could be there for 15, 30 minutes or more does not provide a decent cup of tea.
All other hotels I've stayed at provide an urn with boiling water and tea bags. You make your own. No special treatment, no dramas and you are assured of getting a decent cup of tea every time.
Why doesn’t Waterfront do this?

Easy and fast check in, followed agoda's booking instructions. 

My dad loved the breakfast they offered.

Bad points:

No valet readily available. Staff is either absent or unavailable. We have to request for a bellboy or valet to help us with our luggages.

Being a four star hotel, this should be readily available. Guests are left to find for staffs that would accommodate their luggages.

Rude telephone services staff.  A male voice, I requested for late check out but I was answered with a direct response. No thank yous, no good morning. It seems like he can't be bothered by my request. I was appalled by that demeanor.

No available benches in the lobby. All the chairs are reserved for dining customers only. Talking about unwelcoming lobby. At least put a bench near the entrance so that guests like me can readily sit while waiting for our lift. Take note, I have a toddler with me.

It's quite expensive for that service compared to other four star hotels. The decors and the hotel itself is outdated.

I hope the service will improve.

Check out at 5:00 a.m. only one staff, and they need to check the room before to give you the authorization to leave the hotel, time consuming when you have a flight to take.
The room looks like an old Las Vegas hotel with the wood furniture in bad condition.
The shower head must be 1.70 m high, I am 1.90.
The amenities are plastic and contaminating the environment.
The air conditioning control was not working and blocked at the coldest temperature. The only possible control was on the fan strength or turning the air con off. 
I ordered two shakes and a pizza for a quick snack, the shakes arrive in minutes and the pizza took more than half an hour to be served. 
In the afternoon impossible to nap as the staff was very noisy in the corridor, talking very loud. 
The flooring around the pool is really cheap and not friendly.
It's a large hotel with a glamor reception and and hugh hall, with a lot of traffic. 
It could be a nice experience after a full refurbishment and a better management.

I recommend staying a few nights to adjust to the time change especially from the U.S.  This hotel has several restaurants and a casino if gambling is your forte.  The workout facilities and pool are as nice and comprehensive as I have seen in a hotel; second to none - short of staying at a proper 5 star resort.  This also houses the U.S. consulate for limited services to American citizens.  It is in close proximity to the premier mall in Cebu City; Ayala.

The said was less than 1/2 The normal size and insane price. They should not hold a real 4 star.  Charge me more no problem but give me the right amount of food or drink size. Don't charge me more then cut down on the size as well. All the staff were very nice and trained well. Any 4 star hotel I stayed at anywhere in the world had cable stations updated.
