816248558,"I was certain I had booked a night‚Äôs stay with breakfast included, but when I checked in, it turned out there was no breakfast. Additionally, I expected a room with a bathtub, as shown in the advertisements. They did offer to transfer me to a room with a bathtub, but it was pointless since there was no heater.

815959777,"Staff are not well trained-- they have admitted this themselves. If you speak to one of them, others will say different things and are all not aligned to the point of being confusing and frustrating. They won't address the issue of how they made their customer feel but would just apologise hoping that that would solve the problem. I can only hope that they won't drag the Dusit Thani brand.",4.8,2024-06-09T01:45:00+07:00
816155343,The way they handle communication to their guests from the front desk to the duty manager was never meant to resolve any issue but merely to sweep them off the carpet. They don't make their guests feel valued which is sad as they would have some advantage carrying the Dusit Thani brand in a resort place like Cebu. ,5.6,2024-06-09T01:34:00+07:00

816034234,"Booked for 1 night. When i entered the lobby i felt disappointed as there‚Äôs an on going activity in the lobby which didn‚Äôt really gave me a relaxing vibe. Food options were limited as well and price for the food was extremely high. I understand that it is a 5 star hotel that‚Äôs why the price was high but the qualify of food wasn‚Äôt that great. Asked for an omelette during breakfast and I swear it was the worst omelette i ever had with regards to the taste and the presentation. Overall i felt that value for money wasn‚Äôt there. They have nice ambiance on the beach and poolside tho and front desk was helpful to me when i asked for a late check out the ff day. Although, I had plenty of questions during check in and she looks like she‚Äôs holding her annoyance towards me when answering my questions. Concierge was very helpful.

815853723,Wonderful place for resort staying. Distant corner on Mactan and takes a while for travel to and fro. Grab makes it convenient though. Many other less pricey restaurant choices about 15 mins or more out. Beautiful infinity pool with loblvely sunsets. Good to go in the later part of the afternoon when it is not so hot and the pool is warm. Enjoyed our stay! ,8.0,2024-06-05T04:15:00+07:00

809888675,"Here is a sample review for a hotel that may not be considered value for money:

""Unfortunately, my recent stay at Dusit hotel did not live up to my expectations in terms of value for money. The room rates were quite high compared to the quality of accommodation provided. Additionally, the food prices at the hotel restaurant were exorbitant, making dining on-site unaffordable for a budget-conscious traveler like myself. I also observed that other hotels in the area offer more competitive rates and inclusive packages that would have been a better value for the money. Overall, I was disappointed with the overall affordability and value proposition of my experience at Dusit Hotel",6.4,2024-05-22T01:57:00+07:00

803730473,The Dusit Thani Mactan is a very nice hotel. If traffic is not too bad you can get there from Mactan Airport fairly quickly. The hotel is very clean and the staff always there to help. Take a room in the main building with ocean view to have the beautiful pool in sight as well as Cebu city on the other side of the bay. The breakfast is amazing.,8.8,2024-05-14T09:49:00+07:00

803626796,"My recent stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment I made my reservation through Agoda, the experience was filled with pleasant surprises and thoughtful gestures.

Upon arrival, I was initially taken aback by the additional charge for a sea view room. However, my surprise quickly turned into delight when the front desk graciously informed me that they had upgraded our accommodation free of charge. This upgrade was in recognition of our anniversary celebration and impending proposal, setting the tone for an unforgettable experience.

The panoramic view of metropolitan Cebu from our upgraded sea view room was simply breathtaking, stretching from Liloan to Mandaue. It provided a stunning backdrop for our romantic getaway and added an extra touch of magic to our special occasion.

Each morning, we were treated to a delicious breakfast spread that catered to every taste. The pool, with its expansive infinity design and captivating views, offered the perfect setting for relaxation and leisure.

The refreshing scent of the comfort room near the elevator contributed to the overall ambiance, enhancing our mood throughout our stay. Despite the pebbled sand on the beach, the crystal-clear waters and abundance of fish created a serene atmosphere reminiscent of Amanpulo, making our beach outings truly enjoyable.

The efficient air conditioning in our room ensured maximum comfort, allowing us to escape the tropical heat and unwind in peace. The hotel went above and beyond to accommodate my request to display a proposal message on the TV screen, leaving my girlfriend pleasantly shocked and adding an extra layer of romance to our stay.

The unexpected gesture of a complimentary moose cake for our anniversary was a delightful surprise, surpassing all expectations. Furthermore, the expedited check-in and check-out processes exemplified the hotel's commitment to exceptional service and guest satisfaction.

Despite mentioning a security deposit, the hotel demonstrated flexibility and consideration, given the short duration of our stay. The actual view of the building exceeded the images advertised on Agoda and their website, further enhancing the overall experience.

Moreover, the availability of HD channels on the TV and the thoughtful gesture of designing roses and flowers added an extra touch of elegance to our anniversary celebration, making it truly memorable.

In summary, Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu provided an unforgettable and magical experience, making our anniversary celebration one for the books. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to create special memories on a special occasion.",10.0,2024-05-13T03:20:00+07:00
798100664,"Our group had a fantastic stay at this property. The facilities were exceptional, including the pool, which offered breathtaking views. The spacious rooms were well maintained by the attentive housekeeping staff. Although there was one thing I noticed, the floor looked clean but after walking inside the room without the slippers we would notice our feet got dirty like some soot. The staff was friendly and helpful, some were probably new because they were kind of shy and reluctant, but overall added to our enjoyable experience. ",9.2,2024-05-07T01:49:00+07:00
801883638,"If you are a vegan, i would not recommend this hotel. You can find some options in the Thai restaraunt for dinner. There are no non-cow milks for coffee or cereal, no options for food in other restaraunt. They will make steamed vegetables without butter at your request. Ut might be okay for a night or too but for a longer stay, you may want to being your own food. ",6.0,2024-05-04T12:28:00+07:00

We were glad we stayed in Tower 1 which was away from the noise from the evening festivities. Noise in the hallways or other rooms was also minimal. The massage at the spa was okay, but you can get better quality treatments in town for a cheaper price. The gym was well equipped, but there were no towels or cleaning supplies to wipe down the machines when we went around 6:30-7:00 am (and six people using the gym at the time so it‚Äôs not like equipment wasn‚Äôt being used). The food was fine, though there are not many healthy options if you‚Äôre watching what you eat‚Äî even the kale was fried. The Thai restaurant had the best food, but it needed more spice or at least the usual condiments for guests to spice their food to their liking. A San Mig is 350 pesos at the hotel. There aren‚Äôt easy-to-get-to dining options outside of the hotel so you can feel captive to the pricing and options. It was hard to find servers or get their attention except in the morning or if you‚Äôre sitting directly at a bar.

766487641,"I booked this hotel for 5 days thinking I'd have 5 star hotel experience, but was pretty disappointed overall. If you book this hotel, expect this place to be a 3 or 4 star experience.
Overall build quality of this place was disappointing. The shower head holder was cracked (photo attached) which caused the shower head to drop on my wife's head on the first night. Not sure what the interior designer was smoking when he/she designed the bathroom area but expect a mini flood after taking a shower as there isn'ta barrier to block the water from flowing into the rest of the bathroom (photo attached)
Staff here are very nice I'll give them that but poorly trained, feels like this is a place for interns or rejects from Sheraton/Shangri la, huge let down.
If you are looking for white sand beach then this is not the place, no beach whatsoever unless you count that janky lip around the tip of this hotel.
Lastly, food here is average, not bad but then again if you are going to call yourself 5 stars then get it right. We tried the sports bar restaurant, no different than an outback steakhouse kind of vibe.
The Thai restaurant was decent so I'd go there if you are desperate and don't want to travel out.
Reminder, this place is a bit remote so don't expect to go outside the hotel area by foot and expect a ton of local restaurants around you, that's not the case.",5.6,2024-01-28T10:06:00+07:00

High tea had a cute selection of sweets and savoury which continued until the evening cocktails which were unlimited.

The infinity pool was lovely and we even had a zumba session whilst in the pool! It was so much fun!!

758055858,"A few relevant comments pertaining to the ratings:
LOCATION: 1* 
Mactan is not really an attractive vacation spot by itself, we picked it due to a late booking at the prime time of the year. Poor infrastructure, and the wreck of a stranded cargoship near the hotel facility do not precisely improve on that perception.

HOTEL: 4* 
Relatively good value for money even after considering the peak season pricing. 
Our room had sea-view and was impeccably clean. The utilities worked flawlessly.

FACILITIES (Pool, restaurants, bars, and games): 5* 
The pool is particularly well designed, spacious and clean. Restaurants and bars serve a wide range of food, even for discerning tastes.
A pool-table and foosball round off the excellent leisure facilities.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
(1) A compulsory gala dinner on the new year‚Äôs eve is understandable (for planning purpose), yet a basic allowance of alcohol like a glass of wine and a beer per person would have advisable and considerate, given the premium price tag. More disturbing than the charge itself, was the need to pop out the purse and pay for every serving, which disturbed the celebrations.
(2) The second nuisance on which management didn‚Äôt act even after strong complaints by several guests, was the faux ‚Äúreservation‚Äù of pool-loungers by hotel guests who were not present. Incidentally, we observed how 2 loungers were blocked with pool-towels for 5 hours (9:00 AM ‚Äì 2:00 PM) by a couple. Then they showed up for just 30 minutes and left again. It is beyond comprehension why the lifeguard hands out towels to people who immediately leave, after block-dropping them on a scarce number of loungers, and why the hotel management tolerates this practice to the detriment of all other guests.

Thai restaurant which was so good was only available for dinner. Felts stranded there and had to keep eating at the bar for a few days. My husband also got the worst food poisoning from the sandwich bought at the deli. They probably make it and leave it there for days.

Our check in wasn‚Äôt smooth. Upon arriving, the usherettes at the front waved to us but didn‚Äôt explain where we had to enter from. We even by passed the metal detectors and no one said a thing. 

The front desk staff were courteous but not overly friendly or warm to us. I live in hotels for 6 month out of the year and I can tell you that when I‚Äôm greeted warmly I feel more connected to the hotel chain and am more likely to rebook. This was my first time staying at Dusit Thani.  

Rooms are clean but older looking. Bathroom is clean enough‚Ä¶and doesn‚Äôt have the aged tiles and dirty looking grout that you often have in hotels in SE Asia. 

The view of the shoreline and beach is ruined by garbage floating in the crystal clear water.  We asked the waitress and she said it was because of the squatters nearby. Not sure if this is true. 

Also there is a huge ship that drifted about 200 meters from shore. They‚Äôre currently dismantling it. You can hear banging and see sparks flying. But it‚Äôs sort of entertaining to watch while you swim. Lol.

725395458,"The property is located far from the city and malls which makes travel options costly and limited. Grab usually cannot locate drivers in the vicinity.

We were also disappointed because there was no beach. The water front is boulders with no sand, not ideal for swimming.

Our room was already ready when we arrived at around 11:30am. The front desk staff we have encountered are all very helpful and even gave recommendations for our Cebu City visit. It is quite difficult to travel from the resort due to its location however the concierge can always call a taxi for the guests. The restaurant where the buffet breakfast is served is huge so it doesnt get too crowded and we never had to fall in line just to eat. There are not much options though in the room service menu so we had quite a hard time looking for food for our picky toddler. There is a big play area for children but it is not airconditioned (or aircon not working at the time we visited) so my daughter did not maximize her time there as it was just too hot.

The breakfast served was delicious and you have a lot of food options. However, some of the staff in Tradewinds were unprofessional. There was one particular guy who was not focused on his work and keeps teasing a fellow coworker (front desk). Also, I smiled at one of the chefs/crew but did not even receive a smile back or a greeting. I also noticed a couple of staff talking behind the back of some guests (foreigner), some also talking about how they were not happy with their work (in a non discreet voice). They give negative vibes. This is not a 5-star hotel staff behavior.

Requested a room change and they moved us to building 2, but only late afternoon, after 3:30pm. When we tried to nap in our original room our earplugs couldn't block the construction noise completely.  Once we moved, everything changed, it felt like a different resort.

Besides for the night staff and the dark-energy Edmund at the omelette station, the staff was generally great.

And again, it took them more than an hour to deliver the food and when I complained the staff said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give u a complimentary juice‚Äù. Of course I said ‚Äúno thank you!‚Äù Our expectation is better service bec we paid much.
I was so pissed when I woke up the following morning bec the sun was going to our room and woke us all early. So called them and demanded that we be transferred to another room. They did transfer  us and I asked them why they were not able to give us better rooms when we checked in when the hotel was not even fully booked. So I asked the reception staff that I want to talk to the manager or supervisor to complain all the inconvenience we are experiencing. And she said no manager but will asked the supervisor to call us. Guess what, no calls.  
And one more thing I notice is that they seem to treat the foreign guests better than the local guests. This was particularly obvious to me when we went to the Thai Restaurant. We were told that only reservations allowed but when I insisted they gave us a table. 
I would not recommend this hotel for the bad services and experience we had. ",5.2,2023-04-17T07:55:00+07:00

Service in the sports bar not very good - watched out cocktails sit on the bar counter for about 10 minutes  - had to tell someone if that's our drinks to please bring it!

All sessions in the executive lounge was late - still prepping food and setting it out when the afternoon tea and cocktail hours had already begun - no sparkling wine - although it is on the menu...just lots of things that was not on par with a hotel with a top international brand.

CONS:  The breakfast is disappoiting, not the kind of buffet i expected for such price 1,300Php per head from a luxury resort. so very few selections.. not worth it.  next is we felt some sort of discrimination and bias, ex: some of your staff missed to greet us a goodevening or goodmorning  but greeted the foreigners behind us when we passed by with them and during the breakfast we were only offered juice but they offered all sorts of coffee and tea to foreigner guests next to our table. most of the bench at the lower deck in front of the pool are stained with bird poops. i hope they can improve on this especially for the price the guests are paying for.",7.6,2023-03-29T06:25:00+07:00

The general manager, Mike Kempf, was very responsive to feedback and took the time to make sure that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. The suite room was spacious and had all the amenities we needed, including universal plugs and USB ports, which made it easy to use and charge our electronic devices.

The pool at the hotel was a highlight of our stay - it was beautifully maintained and the perfect place to relax and cool off. The beach was small but peaceful, with clear waters that were perfect for swimming. We also had the opportunity to try the food at the hotel's speciality Thai restaurant, and it was absolutely divine. The Executive Chef, Chef Karthik Ravi, was also very helpful in making sure that our family had meals that met our dietary requirements.

The children especially loved the ""Fun Zone"" kids play area and spent hours there every day. The staff at the hotel were generally friendly and courteous, and we had a wonderful time at the New Year's Eve party where we were seated with the general manager and his family to bring in 2023.

There were a few areas where the hotel could make improvements to enhance the guest experience. For example, the Sunset Bar could be more efficient in taking and filling orders, which would likely increase food and drink sales. It would also be beneficial to have a wider selection of cuisine, particularly for those following a vegetarian diet, and to review the in-room dining process to ensure that hot food is delivered. Additionally, an expanded menu with a variety of options to cater to different palettes would be welcome.

Having a knowledgeable and proactive general manager like Mike Kempf can truly make a difference in the overall experience of a hotel guest.

As I said nice place to stay, but beware of the location issues. Stayed at Dusit Property in many locations, this one was a little disappointing.  ",6.8,2023-01-01T09:14:00+07:00

578519577,"The staff were extremely professional and friendly. The amenities were top notch. We had an overnight Christmas stay and had a lovely Christmas dinner and a delicious buffet breakfast.

Which is why I was disheartened over two things:

- For some unexplainable reason (they literally couldn't or just refused to explain it), they couldn't charge our room for the dinner and buffet breakfast. I had to get my credit card back in my room, twice. Why can other hotels do it but they can't? I don't know, they couldn't tell me either.

- For the prices we were paying, you'd think breakfast was included, but nope, you had to pay for it. I would've appreciated a 'lower-tier' set breakfast instead of a buffet for what we were paying for the overnight stay, but it was either a buffet breakfast or none at all. And since they still couldn't charge the room, I had to yet again go back to my room to get my credit card.

Oh, the beach isn't totally something to write home about. Plus there's a beached ship that hasn't been removed yet.

For the prices we were paying, I'd probably skip them and go to the Shangri-La instead.",8.4,2022-12-25T11:49:00+07:00

567734884,"Hell of a good location and place!! Staff was really friendly! Was accommodated well. Also the hotel had a good view! 

BUT.. 
1.  When we were eating/drinking at the bar (3 occassions during our trip) Our experience with the service was terrible ): DO NOT get me wrong; the staff was super nice!! However, for our experience, it took us atleast 15-20 minutes to get only two drinks every time we dined in. I'm not sure if they were short staffed which is understandable if they were. But they weren't even busy and not much customers were there during that time.

Then, when it came to ordering  food (bar area again), it took more than 30 minutes. I ordered the pizza, and it arrived cold. I didn't want to complain because I was already tipsy and having a good time haha. Didn't want to ruin the vibe.
Being a 5-star hotel, this part was sad.

2. If the pool did not close so early (8pm), it would have been perfect ): After our tours which lasted during the day, it ends and we get dropped off back to the hotel around 7:30/8pm. Wish they closed at 10 So we can relax at the pool after getting a tour ):

3. the wifi was REALLY terrible. I couldn't connect to it in the hotel room.  I couldn't access to yotube through the TV

4. At times, when I contact front desk/concierge for something, they don't answer.  However, when I went downstairs to the lobby, they were talking to other guests. it seems that they are short staffed.

5. The thai restaurant closes earlier than the time it was supposed to be! ):

Overall, still a great experience.
Not going to give this 1 star because I know they can improve on this :) Hopefully, they will see my review!",8.4,2022-11-22T12:22:00+07:00

The receptionist was not able to explain their amenities, the direction, and accessibility time which got me confused because they have 3 buildings.

On a positive note, the infinity pool was really nice and the landscape of the resort is very relaxing.

They have a happy hour buy-one-take-one promo where I ordered 2 different cocktails for me and my friends which have different price tags. I was expecting 2 line items on my bill but they charged me only 1 but with the price of the more expensive cocktail.

1. No one assisted us when we arrived. We were the ones who pushed the cart for our luggages.
2. Room wasnt that clean as there were so many dusts.
3. They do not allow guests to bring the towels which means you have to walk wet, water dripping the floor going to your room.
4. They should have a certain portion in their resto where they can accommodate people who have already gone for swim and would like to take thw breakfast in between since there are really guests who would dip the pool as early as 7am and takes breakfast late. Its very inconvenient to go to the room and change then after breakfast change again. If other resorts have managed to do that, there's no reason you can't.
5. Staff are not accommodating. Even if they will see you needing for help, if you don't say or ask, they won't extend a help. Save those who are in their deli resto because they really are.

526292045,"This is really far, maybe the farthest of all resorts in Mactan, it's at the tip.  This is best for you if you just want to stay here the whole time, because it's so far. During my stay, the hotel was still undergoing renovations brought about by Typhoon Odette.  The only thing to do is hang out in the pool.  Food is very expensive.  There was no complimentary beverage in the room, only water.  Coffee or tea at the coffee shop here costs 160 to 200 pesos.  The beach was not nice; there was no access during our stay but looking at the waters, it was a rocky beach; no sand.   It was only an overnight stay for us but it was enough for a restful weekend.  Nothing to do for more days, in my opinion.

The ambiance at night is spectacular with the bar/restaurant by the pool having someone live singing and seeing the water and twinkling lights across.  Breakfast is so so, could have added more for the price they charge.  But overall, we had a fun stay.  Oh, Loved the BOGO cocktails between 5-7pm I think.",9.2,2022-07-21T07:16:00+07:00

- The staff are very helpful
- Gym is reasonable
-The internal shop sells wine at a reasonable price.
CONS:
- Menu very limited, becomes boring after a few days and no outside food delivery is allowed
- Beach is rocky and not at all appealing
- To use the table and chairs in the open restaurants, you must purchase the buffet, regardless of how much you spend on a la carte. This means that you are forced to sit on uncomfortable bean bags next to the pool, with the mosquitoes. I was spending far in excess of the cost of the buffet, but they still insisted that we move out the restaurant to a cramped bar area (there were 7 of us) or sit outside by the side of the pool.

If you want a few days away with just a pool, restaurant, gym and other normal hotel facilities then yes a good place to visit. If you want to move away from the hotel then it will cost you a fortune in taxi‚Äôs to get around. If you hire a car you will spend most of your time in traffic. We hired a scooter and found that the best way to get around though a little dangerous as the roads are pretty scary with lack of road discipline from other road users.
We had to ask reception to have the room cleaned daily even though there was a make my room illuminated sign to notify the housekeeping staff you wanted the room made up..
Facilities in general were good, Infiniti  pool was great, gym was good and the restaurants also good. When we stayed breakfast was in different restaurant locations within the hotel and sometimes buffet and other time A La cart, choice of food for breakfast was ok but could have been better with a wider choice of offerings.
We had a Delux sea view room which was great and spacious with the usual amenities you would expect from a Dusit Thani property . Staff were great and always pleasant and helpful.

492221677,"Awe stayed here days after the onslaught of the typhoon.

Although running on limited supplies and with no facilities opened aside from the restaurant. They were still able to provide us a 5star service.

491945332,"We arrived at the hotel 12noon and we understand that check-in time is 3pm... However they were not able to give us our room until 5:30PM in the afternoon.  We were tired and exhausted by then - it was a hot, humid day and instead of being able to spend a few hours relaxing we had to be bitten by mosquitoes while waiting in the lobby.  The staff did say we could enjoy facilities, however we just really wanted our room to rest on thay day.

We took our lunch at the sports bar and waited. It took me more than 5 follow-ups before we were able to get to our room. Fellow travelers checking in that day also had the same experience. Worse, when we got to our room at first, it was not prepared yet - miscommunication, they gave room 3101 instead of 3501. 

We understand it was a peak holiday. There were lots of free rooms, but they weren't cleaned yet. As a suggestion, the resort can hire extra help to do cleaning on days like these. Our room's bathroom was moldy, far what I expect from a 5star.

They did allow us to check out late. Lucky our flight back to Manila was late, but how about those with early flights? 

Nevertheless, the resort's facilities such as the pool is superb. I also like the sports bar staff, they were great. To the front desk's credit, they were courteous and respectful all along.",8.0,2022-04-27T21:12:00+07:00
491684462,"Once repairs from the damages caused by the typhoon last year, I think the hotel can be really good with all facilities opened. I understand the need to generate additional income with day visitors but they can really take up so much space and do so much noise especially on weekends. The staff are amazing especially Shinji and Alona from the Lobby Bar. Duty manager John will also make you feel like a VIP.

491392275,"I had high expectations of this trip simply with the amount of money shelled out for our accommodations unfortunately, it was as if I was staying at a relatively low-end hotel facility.

With the exception of the 100M swimming pool and the view of the beach, everything else from the food served (whether paid or part of the room package), the ‚Äúclub room‚Äù, the service and the generally warmth and welcoming demeanor of the staff was not there.

It is understandable that the hotel was still going through restoration as an aftermath of the typhoon last December but why open and operate almost 180-rooms if the service is sub-par. Why use the typhoon as a reason for the poor experience every paying customer have to go through? Definitely unacceptable especially if you‚Äôre a full-paying customer.

Anyway, I don‚Äôt mind going all the way to the end of Mactan for the use of the pool but you will never catch me staying at this hotel again unless things will drastically improve",4.4,2022-04-26T17:14:00+07:00

Buffet breakfast was plentiful with lots of choices. My only minor rant is theres nothing much to do here aside from swim, eat and relax. We viewed the beach, it was ok and small. Not inviting enough to swim. Also, its VERY far from any commercial area so make sure you have everything you need (meds, snacks, etc) when you check-in as theres no convenient store nearby.

However, the staff were continuously patient with us and very much accommodating to our follow ups and inquiries.  In a way we were a bit settled and just decided to enjoy the scenery.

What awed us were the polite and hospitable staff. Not to mention that they were very quick in getting the dishes from our table when they see that you're done with your meal. Kudos to this!

The infinity pool was superb! I like the fact that you have a wide, beautiful view.

The food was delicious though I would have wanted to have more options in their breakfast buffet.

The location has the best view but prepare for a long journey just to get out of the pricey restaurant food. One taxi ride would cost P200 + P100 for a cab driver because of the long drive picking you up. In my opinion, they should have a ‚Äúrainy day‚Äù promo since we were all stuck inside the hotel because of the typhoon. They won‚Äôt even give a discount on their buffet price when NOBODY was there to eat. Literally the food were sitting cold. The hotel is still under renovation months after the typhoon and the lobby looks horrible. It looks waaaaay different on the website. I feel like  it‚Äôs a rip off knowing that the hotel is not on it‚Äôs 100%. They won‚Äôt even offer a meal included in my room since I was not informed that the gym was wrecked and had to be moved in a tiny spa with a jacuzzi in it! No treadmill as well.

They also provide beach/pool towels in yellow stripes, so you don‚Äôt need to bring your own. You are only allowed to exchange your wet towels twice.

The beach and pool experience is superb. You can order drinks & foods and enjoy it near the pool. What I like the most is that they offer Happy Hour every 3:00pm to 5:00pm, so you can enjoy buy 1 take 1 drinks and also their unlimited cocktails.

484993014,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 
The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness.
The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entree's though need to have more variety. Benjarong was closed when we were there due to repairs. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom where we were though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

481459043,"I am dissapointed during our stay , day 2 of our stay feb 14,2022 was our anniversarry and we want it to be memorable unfortunately when we went there 7pm to have our dinner at the restaurant f im not mistaken it was the sunset restobar . One of the staff asked us f we have a reservation..i respond we didn't & he told us f we can wait/willing to wait about an hour, since it was fully occupied for reservation ,or he will call us at our room # since we r check in guest. So ,we agreed and tell him that we r willing to wait and will wait for the call, as long as we can eat our dinner since that night was special for us..but time pass by till 10pm, nobody call us.. so we did not able to eat our dinner.. we tried to call customer service but nobody s answering.. so bad.. the place was beautiful.. but the staffs and theyr service is poor üëéüèªüëéüèªüëéüèªWe went to different resort but this resort was the worst experience for us.. we regret to choose Dusit Thani  to celebrate our Anniversarry.. i would not be going back.. if they informed us ahead of time that dinner has reservation we r able to adjust and book in advance but sad to say no one did, even the front liner on the day we checked in they did not inform us.. how can we know? They should informed us.. It was a bad first time experience.. tsk2x ..üòíto end my feedback, good thing we had brought cup noodles.. it really saved our dinner.. It was really BAD experience ...üò°",3.2,2022-02-15T19:49:00+07:00

481163662,"Stayed at Dusit Thani Mactan after Cebu province was hit by Odette. The hotel was in a sorry state with other facilities not offered for use. What I like with my stay was that the staff was there to assist as perhaps coz there were very few guests at that time and we almost had the pool to ourselves. There was no buffet breakfast but they offered a generous breakfast for me and my sister.  Our accommodation was very roomy but it made me wonder why we were not given the ocean view since there were not many guests coming in at that time. Upgrading, perhaps, is not this hotel's thing. So much for getting what I paid for. hahaha! Seriously, I booked a room at less than 5k a night, with free breakfast.",9.2,2022-02-14T13:02:00+07:00
481115277,"Dusit Mactan is ok. Amenities are good and the view is great. The breakfast was good but they did not serve it warm. I had to call out the manager to heat the food. The rooms are ok but the soundproofing is really bad. I could hear the noise from the other room. I also find that the staff sometimes are not coordinated. They communicated to us that we could check out at 1pm but when they reminded us about the check out time, it was back to 12 noon. 

Overall, our experience was OK. 3/5",6.0,2022-02-13T15:19:00+07:00

Kids were enjoying the pool. My brother had a chance to work here comfortably. My mother was relaxed.
The food was really expensive, but the good thing was, they didn't charge us when we brought our own snacks. 
I appreciate the staff who were very friendly  especially CHRISTINE the front desk girl.  She make sure that our stay will be hassle-free and enjoyable.
The people make the hotel a great experience for the whole family. 
THANK YOU :)

2. The restaurant said we couldn't charge our meal to the room since we did not have deposit (which wasn't asked from us upon check-in) . HASSLE 

3. They did not make up the room despite switching the sign off when we left.

5. They did not confirm that the spa inquiry will push through, and expected us to pay full amount because the masseuse waited for us? They could've called our mobile or even emailed us!!!",4.8,2022-01-06T11:30:00+07:00

473045762,"Booked a Deluxe Seaview with fullboard meal breakfast, lunch, and dinner only to be told by the Seasport Manager we are just getting a Php150 meal credit - whether ala carte or buffet. No wonder the front desk and restaurant in charge couldnt explain it to me properly when I asked about the meal arrangement- php150 is not even enough to buy a cup of coffee and that's what they refer to as fullboard meal! I tried to be understanding why there's no wifi, no cable, and pool is offlimits during our stay but that meal arrangement (and the deceitful restaurant manager) what really annoyed me and almost ruin our New Year celebration.

With its pricepoint, there are other much better hotels within the Punta Engano and Maribago area (especially in terms of customer service) than Dusit. BETTER BOOK IN ANOTHER HOTEL.",4.4,2022-01-01T19:28:00+07:00
