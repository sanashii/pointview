She made the check-in process a breeze and even surprised us with an upgrade to a suite! The room was fantastic - spacious, clean, and very comfortable.

The breakfast buffet was another highlight. The selection was amazing, with something to please everyone's taste. The food was fresh and delicious.

826016948,"I really love bai Hotel's theme of luxury‚Äîit is low key but nevertheless premium. The room we stayed in was very cozy. Comfy beds and the area of the room was spacious enough. The toilet was a bit small, though it's not too small it's a deal-breaker. Anyway, the food. The breakfast buffet was really delicious, but their Japanese resto was easily one of the best Japanese dining experience we've had. Their Tonkotsu ramen is a strong contender for the best in Cebu. It is pricey but it was our Japanese dinner that made our stay in bai unforgettable. Definitely recommend.

I had 3 rooms and I was so disappointed that my room was very dirty, bathrooms had a mold, HVAC had a lots of bugs and dust! Bed sheets found stained and hair! They moved me into different room after 19 hours of flight the second move was even worse of mold smell! I was so disappointed of staying this hotel! Management didn‚Äôt care about the issues and this hotel was not well maintained! The hallway of the 12th floor was super hot no AC! Disappointed like I left headache with mold smell on my room!

Breakfast buffet was great! Family enjoyed the variety of foods available daily. They provide water bottles and necessities during your stay such as shampoo, conditioner, soap, dental kit, slippers as examples. They have a fitness room - ample amount of equipment and it was not crowded. They have kid playroom for those travelling with small kids. Bed was comfortable. Pool bar and pool area was spacious. Would recommend in having some little things looked into such as stains in carpetted floors, chipped areas in doorways in hotels. Other than that, great place to stay! I would definitely consider this as one of the go to hotels if returning to Cebu.

They are listed as 4 stars, but it actually feels like a 3 star hotel, so if you can get a good price for the stay, this would be a good place, but do not expect a 4 star hotel.

The check out was really slow, they asked us to wait on the couch for someone to check our room before we can leave.

There was four of us with three people old and one being a PWD. I was annoyed and mad. I requested again for another table to be open as I can see there are vacant ones.

I only had problem because this time i booked it thru AGODA and i felt like i was misguided by the fact that i booked for 2 yet when i paid and confirmed it showed as booked at 1 capacity.  But thank you, Bai! You will still always be in my choices of hotels to stay!

798121410,"The facility and female receptionist are exceptional. The issue that I have is with the receptionist, elevator and room access, first incedent I don't have elevator access, I went to the receptionist to have it fixed, but only to know when I reached my room (I got elevator access from the other customer with the same floor) there is no access also. The receptionist is not smiling also looks so suspicious even after I prove my identity. The second time I went to the reception, I went directly to the manager after 1 customer he attended to, I was waiting patiently only to find out he needs to reverify me again, I told him was already verified by the previoua receptionist and he can ask him and he told me in a bit higher tone of voice and iritated manner that he needs to reverify, so I did, then there is no apology or empathetic manner I heard from them even though I told him I went from elevator to the reception twice already and I am tired and frustrated. I even overheared him that my access is blocked. I asked him what was thr problem but he ignored my question and he just asked me who is the receptionist who attended me before. I felt really bad that I have to go through all of this. Out of frustration, tiredness and anger and also the urgent need to go to my room to do something urgent, I told them to make sure it will work or else I will come back to them in a very irated manner. So the manager went with me, I was about to tap the elevator access, he told me he already tapped it with his access, I told him i want to tap it myself and check if it is really working. Everything is good except for this and I was about to let it pass but I was not satisfied at how my experience was on this matter and I am hoping it will not happen to the other customers.

A lot of food options and you don‚Äôt have to worry if they run out of food and beverages as they are quick to replenish. I have no complaints on the taste of any food they‚Äôve served. Since I so full, I missed to try their Pani Puri,  Italian& Japanese cuisine, customizable noodle counter and other desserts. I guess something to look forward when we come back.

The pool bar on the roof is lovely, with a great view of the city.
However, they're not always the most organised- four times, our room keys malfunctioned, and once, a massage appointment was mishandled. The managers made sure that the problems were all rectified, but these things happened once too often. One of the rooms that we had showed signs of mold, but our subsequent rooms were clean. 

In other words, service isn't perfect, but the staff will make the effort. The breakfast buffet, which had a blend of Filipino, Western, Indian, Chinese and Korean dishes was fine. The concierge was also very good, and made sure our transport was well taken care of.

In short, I would still stay at bai Hotel, but I would definitely vocal about any mishap. The staff, at least will do their best to correct any problems that arise.

they have this ‚Äòincidental fee‚Äô they ask of you during check-in and it is very inconvenient if you do not have cash as it will only be refunded sixty days after checkout, if you use your card. 

they claim to be an international hotel but then the staff can‚Äôt talk in English even when we were addressing them in English, we had difficulty understanding Bisaya whenever we had any questions or requests. 

their entrance to the hotel felt like an entrance to the airport where you have to remove your belongings and pass it through a conveyor belt then you have to be searched. so, so inconvenient. felt like i was going to jail. 

housekeeping does not change the sheets everyday even though we clearly stated we wanted them changed, even when we called through their landline they still did not change the sheets when we came back. they only tidied the bed. 

they keep boasting their breakfast buffet was Cebu‚Äôs best in 2022 but damn there were barely any choices. they did not even have soda or japanese cuisine choices available. 

i was so disappointed. the only reason we stayed here is because radisson blu‚Äôs pool was out of service during our stay. and the price point between the two hotels is not far off.

776042213,"I stayed here during a visit in Cebu  to view potential real estate investments as I am currently living abroad and lives in a different city in the Philippines.

Upon arrival to property, I was given a twin room and I checked-in ALONE. I told her I very much prefer a large bed which I also mentioned on my booking.

Now imagine if I showed up with a husband? We will be forced to sleep in 2 separate beds because the lady at the front desk was unwilling to do anything about it. No upselling provided, no options given, no nothing.... 

The lacklustre of the service experience was a let-down, not sure why though. The rooms had a lot of defects from the shower room to the poor finishing round the corners of the room. 

It later made sense to me, they wanted to make more money from the rest of their room inventory hence given out their least favorite rooms to guests booked on OTAs such as Agoda. 

So, to make use of the spare bed, I asked my real estate agent to stay with me since there's a bed I am not using, and I was forced to sleep in a smaller bed than what I originally expected to have paid for.   

As  a hotelier myself, this left a bitter taste, or maybe... I EXPECTED WAY MUCH. Nevertheless, breakfast was very good and the front-line team are amazing and were very hospitable throughout.

They would have let me waited longer if I didn't ask the reception again and again when the room will be ready while most of the other guests just could check-in straight away.
Room was clean, bathroom cleaningness could be improved though (stripes on mirror and glass surfaces looks not good). Windows dirty inside and outside. Parts of the room looked old already. Not possible to connect computer to TV (HDMI or USB-C). 
Internet was good and reliable. 
Room had a door to neighboring room where they played loud music and talked loud including noise of certain activities nobody want to hear! Not nice in this price class!
Security outside extremely rude against vaping outside the designated smoking area on the parking space where nobody else was present or bothered, the guy seemed just bored and had nothing better to do.  I am not a smoker and dont want to smell like an ash tray or inhale cigarette smoke! Smoking area terrible in general. Should have better options for guests in a hotel in this category!
Breakfast was okay though you have to walk long distances to your table and it is very crowded most of the time.
Would maybe book again but never ever a room with door to next room!
Staff is extremely friendly towards guests. Staff should have it's own service elevators though, elevators are over used already by guests, staff going in and out makes it worst.
Location is OK but can't do anything without a taxi ride. Area outside dodgy especially during night time. Beggars and hookers will bother you day and night few steps outside the hotel, not nice. Mall next to the hotel is low grade, need to take taxi to better mall. No nice restaurants or anything within walking distance.

The rooms are great, the hotel is affordable and the buffet breakfast was good. There are some improvements the hotel could make though, the pastries were too heavy and the juice tasted powered.

So when I arrived  and was about to  Ask for airport transfer... It was only then that I realized I've missed the date.  I was sooo busy with the Fluvial Procession of Sinulog 2024. Our navy is in charge of the security of the Galleon at that time.  I wasn't able to check the schedule. I hope you can consider our reservation be rescheduled to a later date. 

Nevertheless we've checked in in 24-25 January 2024 and found it exceptional.

Was told through email we could check into our room by 0600 which was fine. The person at the front desk told us that would probably not happen as ALL guests checked out at 1100. She also laughed and refused to get the manager when I requested. I was then told I could purchase a room for the night however would need to move out of that room at 1100 and wait until 3 pm to check into my already scheduled room. We agreed to get a room. Hardly slept in 36 hours. THEN we had to wait over 30 minutes to see if a room was ""available."" Again asked to speak with manager whom we were told ""ghosted"" her.

760086836,"We were surprised about the big discount we got at Agoda, especially being able to stay in a high end place like BAI.  For the price we got it in, it was a steal.  However, we soon figured out why.  Unlike the usual / standard rooms at Bai, the ones on the 8th floor seemed to be behind the times.  There was a slight, weird smelly odor in the room (nothing anyone can do),  unlike the rooms we've stayed in so far, it seems like the rooms on this floor were not carpeted.  The pool, because they allow day use, was crowded at the time.  DO not go to the pool until sunset. Since it's on one of the top floors, there is no shade from the burning sun.  I was quite happy with the service and staff. Very excellent. The breakfast buffet was good, lots of options.  And overall we enjoyed it because we realized that the money we were spending just to do a walk-in at their buffet was close to the price that Agoda offered.  So if you think about it that way, that  it's basically just the buffet price  + a place to sleep / stay for the night, then it's a great deal.  Otherwise, you're better off booking at much nicer / more comfortable budget hotels.

759209436,"Concerned by the increasing number of negative reviews for the initially booked hotel, I opted to cancel my reservation and chose Bai Hotel instead. Despite initially booking with the breakfast option, a system glitch led to its exclusion. Despite addressing the issue with Agoda, it remains unresolved. Agoda promised a response within 24-48 hours but closed the case without providing any information. Consequently, during check-in, an additional fee for breakfast had to be paid. Agoda's lack of partnership with the hotel seemed to hinder their ability to address the situation, preventing me from canceling and rebooking. This disappointing experience with Agoda has left me contemplating the use of their services in the future.

Turning to Bai Hotel, a 4-star establishment, it lived up to expectations. The staff exhibited professionalism, offering a top-notch greeting upon our arrival. As check-in wasn't until 3 pm, we stored our luggage and purchased breakfast vouchers, a process complicated by Agoda's limitations. Thankfully, Maria and Rose proved invaluable in securing the vouchers. Despite the inconvenience of luggage screening at the entrance, the lobby left a lasting impression. Exploring the hotel before check-in, we glimpsed the steakhouse and sushi restaurant.

The room, boasting cleanliness, provided a scenic view of Mactan Island. An evening visit to the 21st floor, where the pool and restaurant were located, revealed an outstanding view. While the pool restaurant's drinks were satisfactory, the appetizers were underwhelming, both in portion size and cost. I strongly advise against ordering Beef Salpicao.

On a brighter note, the buffet breakfast the following day was a positive experience, featuring an impressive array of international dishes. Although lacking in specialties, the variety and quality of the offerings were commendable. With two more nights ahead, I anticipate the remainder of our stay will be enjoyable, despite the early check-out time of 11 am.

While I would love to consider staying here again, the unresolved breakfast issue with Agoda and their system glitch pose a hurdle. If Agoda can address these concerns and enhance their customer care, I would be more inclined to book through them for future stays at Bai Hotel. However, the absence of communication from Agoda regarding the breakfast issue casts doubt on the feasibility of future bookings through their platform.

Hotel staff were very polite and always ready to greet you with a smile.

Room was really cold even though I've already adjusted the thermostat, however the comforter and blankets do their jobs to keep us warm. Complete facilities on the room and I'm glad we had a nice view unlike the previous room we had last year. Breakfast buffet was just no longer the way we expected it to be. Still has a lot of varieties. Overall, still a greaat stay. I would love to extend one more night but we had to go home.

I could say that in the last several years, we have stayed in 1-3 week stints at the Marriott Ayala, Quest, Blu, and most recently 2 nights at the Fili-NuStar. Make no mistake, the Radisson facility is nice and the Fili-Nustar is grand and the best rooms. 
Bai hotel is pretty straightforward hotel with decent rooms. Although it doesn‚Äôt have the fancy amenities the bigger hotels have, it makes it up with its staff.
A special shoutout to the Cafe Bai breakfast & lunch team - Jenny, Ranyl, Angel, Angeles to name a few. They really make you feel special by making us really feel at home.

Gym was great and the breakfast buffet had so much selection. 
The location was right near a shopping mall but it was not nice to go outside as the air smelt so bad. 
We dined in the Ume restaurant which the food was decent but the service was extremely slow, even for drinks. But I guess you are pretty stuck unless you were to get a taxi anywhere else. The same was across the other venues such as Twilight. 

Disadvantage is that drinking water was not provided even in the restaurants. All of the other places I‚Äôve stayed in the Phillipines so far had drinking water filters on every floor. 

Also sadly missed out on the breakfast on the second day due to an early flight and it was not a possibility for me to pay for extra to put this towards a buffet dinner the night before.

748059987,"The place is really nice. But their earthquake detection system doesnt work. During the night of our stay, the bldg shook bad so guests from the top floor panicked and came down. We were staying at the 10th floor, and the hotel has around 20 floors. If nobody came down, the staff woudlnt have known about how bad the shake was. I dont blame the staff, i blame their detection system. We even came a across guests whom we had to calm bc of a past earthquake occurrence, sort off a ptsd. The evacuation area wasnt made clear to the guests too, so ppl just came out to the parking lot by the highway. Luckily the shake wasnt that much of a magnitude. The hotel should fix their detection systems so the staff could prepare and know what to do. 
The room is very clean and the staff were very accommodating. Their detection systems were the only issue here

712302295,"I recently had the pleasure of staying at BAI Hotel in Mandaue, and I must say it was an absolutely incredible experience from start to finish. This hotel truly deserves its reputation as one of the best in the area.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and a level of courtesy that set the tone for our entire stay. The staff at BAI Hotel are not only professional but also genuinely friendly and accommodating. They go above and beyond to ensure that guests have a memorable and comfortable stay. What impressed me the most was that they never once said no to any of our requests. Whether it was arranging transportation, providing recommendations for local attractions, or accommodating special dietary needs, they always found a way to make it happen.

The hotel itself is a masterpiece of design and architecture. The moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted by a stunning blend of modern elegance and Filipino culture. The attention to detail in the interior decor is remarkable. The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and offer breathtaking views of the city or the sea, depending on your preference. The cleanliness and overall maintenance of the property were impeccable.

One of the standout features of BAI Hotel is the dining options. The restaurants on-site serve a wide range of culinary delights, from local Filipino cuisine to international dishes, all prepared with precision and flavor. The breakfast buffet was a particular highlight, offering a diverse selection of fresh and delicious options to start your day.

The hotel's amenities, including the pool and fitness center, are top-notch, ensuring that guests have plenty of ways to relax and unwind during their stay. Additionally, the hotel's location in Mandaue is convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and transportation hubs.

In conclusion, BAI Hotel in Mandaue exceeded all our expectations. It's a place where luxury, exceptional service, and beautiful surroundings come tog

I strongly recommend to BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE HOTEL'S WEBSITE AND NOT THRU AGODA. On my last online booking with Agoda, I feel I was scammed. I booked for 2 nights stay for two persons hence I requested for twin beds. I paid 12K plus in pesos (with free breakfast for 1 PAX ONLY!) while the price in the hotel is only around 4800 per night or 9K plus only for 2 nights and with free breakfast for two persons already. SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BOOK DIRECTLY AT THE HOTEL AND NOT THRU AGODA. Because of this experience, probably we will choose another hotel to stay. Bai Hotel should warn Agoda for overpricing since its their hotel's business or reputation will be tarnished. That's our experience.

662404869,"Bai Hotel is a great place to stay with friendly staff, good facilities and is very clean. The property is first rate and has multiple restaurants and is close to Park Mall and more. It is not the best area in Cebu City with slums next to it and graffiti on monuments near by but the hotel itself is outstanding. The only issue is the pool. Upon check-in I was told there were 2 pools, 1 for kids and one for adults. Kids use both so it's hard to swim with jumping and splashing going on. I recommended the hotel have adult hours such as first couple hours of the morning and the last couple in the evening. Other than that issue, Everything was good at Bai.

The only drawback is both pools have many kids so if you are trying to get a swim in it cn be diffulcult. I recommended making 6-8 am and the last hour or two at night be an all adult swim time. I will start swimming early morning during this and future stays. Overall, Bai Hotel is highly recommended.

The rooms were spacious, clean, fresh towels upon request, and super friendly and gracious staff.  We ordered room service, had breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby, lunch by the rooftop pool and throughout it all we had good food and good service.  The staff made sure we were taken care of.  Kudos to the staff at the rooftop patio for taking care of a nice evening out without the kids! We had so much fun! Would definitely go back again.

656336928,"They were generous enough to allow us to check in earlier than 3pm since they have an available room na. The room was clean, staff were nice especially the housekeeping ladies who kept on greeting us or smiling at us whenever we glance at them. I understand na Cebuano/Bisaya dialect is being used sa hotel, but I'd appreciate if staff would ask (like reception, phone operator, dining staff) if we know Bisaya or we're comfortable with Tagalog or English. I had to say, ""Sorry I don't know how to speak Bisaya"", and had to ask them to repeat what they're saying in Tagalog/English. Bed was soft and you know that the aircon's air was okay. We had work before our flight so we were surprised that we slept through the day and woke up at 12am. Such a shame that I wasn't able to use their gym nor the pool. Breakfast buffet -- Taho with the waiter in a costume is amusing. I was also surprised na may champorado, banana bread, and different bread loaves, which is very seldom with hotel buffets. I would love if we could interact with the chefs like sa Omelette station, parang may window and di ako sanay. I know na may process but I prefer na makita ko din how it's being cooked. I ended up just getting the ham and cheese omelette which was already cooked and placed in the chaffing dish. I just wish there were more dried fish, squid, or mangoes since Cebu is famous for these. There was an incident as well and the staff was quick to assist us, and had us compensated too. We were not travelers whose fond of complaining but we felt the urge to raise our concern and we were glad it was handled professionally and discreetly. Only room for improvement maybe is the bidet -- lol the pressure was way too high it felt like certain parts of us would be ripped. üòÖ We ended up not using it. Overall, we enjoyed sleeping at Bai and would still stay here whenever we're in the city.

when I entered our room, it was really nice and look clean but the smell was not good. I started sneezing and then coughing.  I thought, it was only me , then , my daughter started sneezing like me. I told her to use mask because I told her ther are allergens. 
my daughter & son in law also had the same reactions - started sneezing & coughing.
I then realize maybe it was the carpet that smelled like molds due to moisture of aircon. or maybe the curtain.

Room - bed was clean. Can't say much for the rest. There was leftover stains on the chairs and we didn't want to lounge around after that... Bathroom was great, hot water and clean towels but honestly that's about it. The rest of the deco was dated, wallpaper was about to peel... 

Check in took a grand total of 30 minutes despite only 2 others before us. It was slow. Staff encouraged us to provide cash of 2000 PHP for deposit instead of charging to card, stressing that it takes I think up to 15 days? for refund. 

The only upside was that the hotel was near to the airport - about 10 mins away by grab.

630310289,"Booked as it was recommended by my friend, initially it's not my hotel choice but I just gave it a try. Here what happened though.

My room changed 3x. Lack of  staff communication and request for city view  during booking if not you will be seeing cargo containers during your stay ( harbour view as advertised). 

Room is spacious and safety is the top priority (undergo scanner before entry), only positive during my stay. It's worth it if you will just stay in the hotel most of the time, however if you're out daily and just use it to sleep and rest it's not so worth it anymore ( considered expensive for a solo traveller and compared to other hotels in the city).  Stayed 4D3N and mostly I'm outside ( day tour). On my 2nd day, since I'm a bit sensitive with drinking water (hotel provided:nature's spring), I need to order online different brand of water (7liters) and other necessities. The driver was not allowed to enter even at the lobby or entrance door at least, I need to pick up my delivery items outside (near the main street) which is really inconvenient and difficult most especially it's heavy (my reason ordering online so I won't carry it too long since I'm having back pain). Nobody offered to help me out and staffs are just watching me, entrance staff did not open the main door even he saw me carrying heavy things, I just hope at least he can open it as I don't expect him to help me carry. I'm really disappointed on that time. I don't expect them to carry it for me since it's my things but at least have the act of initiative to offer help (just opening the door for me to go in since my hands are full is already a big help).

Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è: Worst bathroom/toilet floors I have seen in my life: very slippery ( dangerous! High fall risk).

Otherwise, has a good view at the top floor bar area but need to use stairs going up. Not sure if they have lift for PWD.

Btw, don't forget to bring cash or credit card with you as you needed to deposit php 8000(check in). They don

- near the beds no power outlets for even charging one device. Should be impossible in the era we live.
- airco in the room is noisy and we experienced a most unpleasant air atmosphere which contained a lot of moisture and smells
- after having taken just a normal shower, the mirror in the bathroom was full of condense.  A modern 5-star hotel should have heated mirrors

I placed my son's cereal on a paper cup for several reasons, one it is safer than breakable ceramic, and secondly, taking away the cereal of my 5 y.o. child would mean him crying and crying, it would have been more humane if that staff gave a consideration to the child for, but I believe doing that judging stance is uncalled for and very unprofessional. but over all our bai weekend was a very nice experience

I wish that they would clean the windows and glass wall by the infinity pool. I had a spectacular view from my room, but I couldn't take any photos since the windows are so dirty.  Location is nice since it had a mall adjacent to it, but otherwise, anything else 'Cebu' will require a Grab or taxi ride.  Staff could also be trained in being problem-solvers and resourceful. Default response is often 'sorry sir, we're out' or 'we can't ' or 'I don't know' or 'sorry this is the way we've been doing it'. Otherwise a great stay.

Was put in a pedestrian rate room farthest from elevator, on a floor where construction activities were taking place.

This is a popular hotel facility for singles & couples Chinese & Korean travelers.  Not so for single PWD business travelers.

Was moved to a PWD room as it became available.  Air con was an issue for regulating temp.  Second day it leaked directly into my suit cases.  No offer for free laundry or other to accommodate.  I had to do my own laundry in room to have clothes for our conference. 

Free breakfast seems to be an inordinate focus of staff.   It‚Äôs a nice breakfast buffet.  Seems well stocked and nicely displayed‚Ä¶if not done so to use the maximum amount of space.

The breakfast buffet seems to be an inordinate focus of staff.  Yet, no accommodation is made for PWD or business travelers.  I had to navigate through the hung-over Chinese couples, and Korean couples with kids to get my breakfast safely to my far corner single table.

It's very spacious, clean and with lots of choices. This is very important for me as I am very particular with neatness.  Their pool and the person in charge are very pleasant, too. Child number two enjoyed swiming there. I have been to different places and hotels abroad and as a Cebuana, I feel proud that we have this hotel that can compete globally with their facilities, cleanliness and professionalism.

568074745,"The rooms are spacious, neat and cozy. However, there were hotel policies that I see as inconvenient. One, food delivery riders are only allowed at the parking lot designated to them. We needed to walk and pick up our food from there. Two; hotel trollies can only service you within the hotel lobby to any floors. They can't go down to the basement parking or parking lot area around the hotel. So, if you are parked at the basement, you need to take the stairs or the elevator yourself and drive your car up outside the lobby. 

I also want to mention that when we checked in, we paraded the lobby carrying large duffle bags and back packs yet none of the staff offered us a trolley. I think they should rename the hotel ""Bye""?

Good Bai, to Good Bye! Me and our group had so much stress in this hotel. Hope they review their policies.

567874197,"Maybe it's just me, but I think this is a favored hotel for foreigners and csw's. They're teeming in the lobby, the buffet restaurant, and at the elevator entrance/exits. There are a lot of ofw's as well, with their family coming to fetch them. It is understandable as it is near the airport, the price is reasonable especially if there's a promo, and it also includes a buffet breakfast with the rate. Security is top notch as xray being done for everyone who enters the main lobby. Elevator will only work with your own room card. Plenty of choices for buffet breakfast with one station devoted mainly to SK tourist or long term cebu staying SK. There are a lot of them here as well. Parkmall just across the road offers lots of foid choices if you don't want to eat at the hotel. Poolbar and pool at the top of the hotel was nice, although always full. Daily housekeeping makes up the room and makes one stay comfortable. TV's audio is maxed at vol 25, so you can't disturb other guests. Always ask to be placed at the high floors and away from the elevator.

Besides that, the location is isolated and gives the feeling of being in a ""golden"" prison. When entering their driveway  the so called tactical guys will do a semi check of your car. When entering the lobby all your belongings will be checked and questioned. So we had to get approval from the management to bring in a little siccors which is always part of our travel stuff. No for real!  It is in intrusive experience all your stuff get checked. So if you like procedures, so called security which takes away your personal privacy and it is ok to be ""locked up""  in a remote hotel, go for it. 
Probably ok for 1 night. Otherwisee there are better options in Cebu in terms of welcoming hospitality and location.

The down side happened during the entourage preparation. None of the staff assisted with the elevators as we were put on different floors. So we had to communicate with the rest of the entourage on who has the key card to go to the floor where we need to go as there are only 2 key cards provided per room.
It was a bit stressful as my aunt who has difficulties in walking had to wait which cousin has the keycard to move from one floor to the other.

Great security when arriving along with Xray and metal detectors when arriving. Gives added comfort as a guest.

Housekeeping is 5 Star spot on ! 5*  Pool on 21st floor is fantastic and can view beautiful sunset. Open until 11pm if i recall.  Friendly staff great ambience and view of the city.  Rooftop bar aslo great view loud club music , hard to carry conversation , but that's the ""club atmosphere "".  Service a little slow but we were distant table from the bar, understandable.  We added the buffet add on when booking , nice selection, fruits , omelets and many offers.  Huge buffet and dining room hope for a close table or can be a hike to get a 2nd plate.  Nice staff and very courteous.   Overall would definitely recommend and im sure I'll stay again ony next trip.   Large mall across the street with many food options if you want to dine out. Bai Cafe excellent baristas , super friendly, was icing on the cake. Servcie with a smile.  Good flow of taxi during the day , small wait after 9pm , maybe 10 min+.

If you buy breakfast its P988 or about $20 pp, buy at booking only cost us extra $6 pp. The pool bar and rooftop bar were both well stocked and we took advantage of both. Live band on Saturday night and it got crowded, so get up there early if you want to go. Overall, a great experience and will book again when we visit Cebu next.

They offer a small box being passed off as a fridge. Instant coffee such a great deal. No extra plates and silverware if you bring in food. Tons of security, you go though medal detector, bag screening and temperature check every time you enter the hotel! If you are dropped off by auto, they run mirrors around the bottom and check trunk, does that make you feel safe staying there? The staff loves to tell you the hotel rules every chance they can. Their smiles aren‚Äôt there because everyone is required to wear a mask, does this appeal to you? The price charged per night is not worth the headache at this hotel.

538408442,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well. 

Departure was fairly smooth, though.

The operator on their In-dining at one point lost her patience, she answered in a deadpan tone ‚Äúmm‚Äù as in ‚Äúyes‚Äù in Bisaya. And I wasn‚Äôt the annoying type of guest.

HOUSEKEEPING was outstanding. Shoutout to Sir Jheno *clap*.

I was really impressed by the quality and amount of choice they give you at the breakfast buffet. this is really amazing and very delicious. Absolute recommendation for that.

Also the Marble&Grain steakhouse in the hotel is fantastic!

This puts Bai just below the most expensive hotel in town. 150p is a more reasonable rate and max I'd expect. The canned soft drinks are equally as over priced and need lowering. The other problem, I've raised with the awesome staff is the beer is not cold enough. At 190p it should be ice cold beer and the staff need a freezer. Refrigerator chilled beer is not cold enough in this climate.

The rooms are nice but need more electrical outlets. The only bad thing about this hotel is that it is practically a 4-star hotel in every way imaginable but still has 1-star ridiculously hard and cheap hotel beds. I saw this on another review but still booked here. They brought me a cushioned mattress topper which helped a little but it's not enough. I will regrettably book elsewhere next inevitable visit to Cebu.

We got into our first room but it smelled dusty - probably because of the construction and repairs that got stuck in the AC filters but they were very quick to assist us in our room transfer.

The staff were so courteous and friendly. I can sense that they do not discriminate the guests and I applaud them for that.

My sole disappointment was their buffet breakfast for which I had to pay P500.00 since my booking did not include this. It was more of the choice (or lack thereof). They try to be international but it's like the same chicken pieces in different sauces. Where's the bacon? Is this not a standard in buffet breakfasts?

Although the Business Centre was closed they assisted me with printing out our travel docs.
The rooms were clean, AC was cool so we were able to sleep well.

To all the staff of Bai Hotel, thank you so much! We had a grand time.

My room was very clean and in great shape.
There was live music on the rooftop bar but I needed to sleep so I missed that.
The morning breakfast buffet was amazing ...too bad I couldn't sample everything...but great presentation.

479929049,"Room:
Freezing a/c that did not allow you to control the air temperature. Nearly got sick. 

Couch smelled like mold and I had allergic reaction just sitting on it.

We were told by our driver that it was a new hotel but there were water stains on the walls from leaks, and it looked worn. 

Shower pressure was good but sink barely had any water pressure. 

And the breakfast which had a very large variety of buffet style options really suffered in quality and freshness. Some of the hot dishes were half hot/half cold. Soggy scrambled eggs, and reheated servings from previous days. 

We changed to another hotel that is half the price and smaller rooms, but the air is fresh, no mold smell, an adjustable a/c, etc‚Ä¶
