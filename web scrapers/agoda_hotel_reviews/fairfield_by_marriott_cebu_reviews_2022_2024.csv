Agoda,817554055,"Overall, my experience was positive.  It is marriot branding afterall. However, I was not informed beforehand that I needed to provide a confirmation letter to authorize another person to stay under my reservation. It would be helpful for future guests if this requirement were clearly communicated at the time of booking

Agoda,816309595,"Marriott is always with pretty good interior design but what surprises me the most is how the reception was so reactive in so many ways! Asking about what a fair taxi rate from A to B, where to find the shops we were looking for‚Ä¶etc.

Agoda,791504757,"I had flown from Vancouver to Manila and then connecting flight to Cebu. It was a long travel day and the Fairfield Marriott was my hotel stop. The front desk staff were very professional and had me checked into my room very fast. The Lobby was immaculate and all the staff helpful. The room was just as advertised, and I was very pleased with the room arrangement . I had some travel arrangements to make and again the front desk went above and beyond  to help me get it all arranged . The restaurant and serving staff were beyond amazing. Having me seated promptly and my taking my food order  in a timely fashion.  The food was spot on and the dessert even better than I could have expected. The end of the night came and the bed was very comfortable and clean. Checking out was again a pleasure as they were prompt and efficient on getting me on my way. I will be returning to Cebu again and will choose to stay with them again.

Agoda,771128042,"The Hotel is nice newly built, more expensive than Bai Hotel. I checked in after 10pm and they dont have room service or at least resto that open until midnight for late comers. The breakfast on my first day was not great but the following day it is completely different and it was really good , selection is between Filipino food and European. Different selection of Bread 3 choices of cold cuts and then typical breakfast of Cebuanos, egg station. most of the food that needs chilling is in the chiller and it was really good. The Hotel is clean and Staff are approachable and friendly. Other facilities are  pool and gym, looks like they have also function room but not sure.  I consider to try them again when I am in Cebu.

Agoda,759152465,"The hotel is amazing,
I had a 3 day layover between my flights. The staff, the facilities are amazing. I highly recommend.

It's a very good location from the airport, far from the city center though. Traveling by car to Cebu city center can take a long time due to traffic.
it depends on your needs. Booking a motorbike takes you places much faster, but obviously is incovenient for the heat, dust, etc ..
