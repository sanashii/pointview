816153525,"I‚Äôve been staying here since it was Marriott and the staff are unbelievably fantastic.  From the front desk to the security/front door men to the wait staff, every staff went above and beyond.  I cannot say enough but the place needs an overhaul renovation. The wallpaper on the ceiling in the reception area are peeling, the rooms have a musky old smell to the shabby carpets on each elevator bank to name a few. I‚Äôve stayed at the IT Bloc and this place has a newer modern ambiance. Overall Seda Ayala Center gets three stars. One for the fantastic staff, two for the location, and three convenience being the center point to every where.  ",8.4,2024-06-09T12:50:00+07:00

However, my only complaint is (though a bit nitpicky) the mildew in the bathroom tiles. I just can't stop staring at it as I take long showers and it's quite important to me.

Staff were very courteous however, during breakfast I noticed when you're all Filipino, they will sit you at the back. The first and second time I was with my British husband and we were sat at the front and on the side with a nice view. This time I was with my mother who is a senior and we were sat on the table in front of the egg station. The busiest area! My mother felt very dizzy while having breakfast because people were walking and children running around us.
I'd still choose this hotel whenever we're in Cebu as its location is very convenient. Ayala mall is just beside it.  I just hope they would have consideration especially with seniors.",9.6,2024-03-01T07:58:00+07:00

I will say that after a month plus stay in various locations in the Philippines on this trip, which included staying in 8 higher end resorts and hotels, I consider myself an expert on breakfast buffets.   The Seda's can definitely use some improvement.  It is the only buffet in the last month I walked away hungry from.

Some critiques:  somewhat worn carpeting in hallways.  Layout of bathroom is not very good for privacy, with shower easily viewable from entry door unless bathroom door is COMPLETELY closed.  But, also noted that the ventilation in the bathroom is very good, with the plentiful airflow exiting through the shower ceiling to keep humidity low after showering (wife appreciates this for doing all her girly stuff at the bathroom counter).  Mini-fridge is in a cabinet with poor ventilation (since the furniture is pressed against the wall, blocking the vent holes in the back) and I kept the cabinet doors slightly open to encourage better operation of the fridge while there - it's like 120+F inside that cabinet if I don't do that. 

We stayed there for a couple consecutive nights on two different occasions during our trip, the first was during the Sinulog, and the other was about a week later.  During Sinulog, and there were frequent performances of dancers and live music during that time, lots of photo opportunities and just very lively.

766031591,"THE WORST STAFF AND THE WORST EXCUSES YOU CAN EVER HEAR FROM A CLAIMED 4STAR HOTEL!!!! DO NOT BOOK HERE AND DO NOT DARE TO MAKE A LITTLE REQUEST. THE STAFF HAS NO SENSW OF URGENCY.

CHECK IN WILL INFORM YOU THAT THE ROOMS ARE NOT READY YET AFTER THE 2PM STANDARD CHECK IN TIME, you have to check every after 15minutes. 

And the excuse they will give is that the house keeping have not cleaned my assigned  room. And they know that tourist will be occupying the hotel since its sinulog they should be ready and has a complete and extra staff to make it smooth and fast. But they will always say its not done yet.

The towels are brown color, its harsh on the skin. And has torn parts esp on the edges. Its really horrible!!!
 
And upon check out I accidentally left my card case with all my cards and ID inside, I called the hotel to check if I left something, it took 20mins and no return call from them and I had to call them myself for follow up. And on my 2nd call i was on a 29 mins call with the hotels staff and decided to stay on the line for the feedback from the house keeping, and they said its not in the room. So I decided to ho back to seda and asked the front desk to allow me to go and check myself, ans viola I found it under the folded part of the duvet, and at 2:16pm the room is not even cleaned yet. So it made all sense why the room is not done and ready for the next guest to check it because they are under staffed.

At Misto they keep serving detox water and juice that don't supposed to serve for breakfast.  I see people keep complaining like every single day while we we're there. Staff at misto can't keep up serving drinks to people. I had to ask couple can of juice at Club Lounge for my husband which is quite crazy. Sometimes we rather to eat breakfast at the Club Lounge even they don't have much stuff to chose from but the staff there are very accommodating.   2. At Misto bar there are 2 female staff  by the entrance are keep there eye on us everytime we come to eat for breakfast. We usually come down little after 9am. The lady have a big mole between her lip and nose, and her colleague they kept looking at their wrist watch tapping it seems like we have to get out right after we get our food but yet they're still a lot of people coming down to eat.

737430609,"I stayed at the Seda Ayala Center Cebu and found it to be extremely pleasant. It was my first business trip to the area. A whitetop taxi cost 500 pesos ($12 USD) to get there from the airport. The hotel has 24-hour security around the perimeter to prevent anyone from wandering in. Inside, it's very clean and well-decorated. There is a lot of staff to greet you and they are very attentive. The room was comfortable and suitable for a person of my height (6'2"" / 1.9m). The Internet connection is stable and worked well for all my conference calls. The breakfast buffet has a lot of options (American, Indian, Asian, & vegetarian). Location wise: there is a very nice indoor shopping mall with everything anyone could need within a few minutes walk. Other destinations are a short drive by taxi/Grab (the local equivalent of Uber).

726992404,"2 main reasons why I did not satisfy our stay in Seda Ayala Center

- Customer service : Very poor
1. At the beginning, our room was not available until I asked for the reason why and told the receptionist that I would wait for the room ready, and it ended up with offering double bed right away after I questioned why it is not available, what if I wait for the double bed room which I booked for, how long it will be etc. It was 3:30 pm to try to check-in with a female receptionist, who has mid-length straight hair style.

The thing is that she should have explained me first why our room is not ready, and have offered me 2 options to choose either I should wait or get a twin bed, instead of simply saying that we have only twin bed room. And I said why, she said rooms are full and I asked again is it because of cleaning? and she said Yes. She said you don't want? and I said Why would I? If so, I should have booked for twin. Very simple! 

During our conversation, she was texting on her WhatsApp and assisting me at the same time. I understand there is no problem with using her own phone as long as she assists their customer properly, but she didn‚Äôt.
No apologies given, No alternative option to choose from the beginning, No proper explanation provided.

2. Secondly I was surprised after she checked my ID and gave me a paper to sign with full of wrong information, including somebody's personal details like phone number, passport number, address, date of birth and etc. I said this is not mine and she said that JUST cross it with the line and put your information. I have never seen to sign with someone‚Äôs booking information mixed with mine over it.

- Room condition - So so, It would be great if there is a window or balcony, but it was ok. Cozy and clean.

- Breakfast (included) - Nice. small restaurant in the lobby area but enjoyed.

723146640,"I had a beautiful stay at the Seda Ayala Center Cebu with my mother. The Front Desk was quick to check us in. The room was quite lovely and has the amenities expected from a topnotch hotel such as Seda: kettle, safe, good toiletries etc. I love the couch by the window and the marble coffee table as well. Breakfast was really good and they have quite a variety  of food choices from local to continental! The staff at the breakfast area were very nice and attentive. Housekeeping was good too. The lobby was lovely and spacious, and impeccably cleaned. I noticed how the housekeeping staff actually meticulously clean the tables at the lobby. Porters/bell service was very good too. It‚Äôs also right next door to Ayala Center, which is just excellent! There‚Äôs a separate pathway to the mall from the hotel. How cool is that? The lifts were also good and fast. The only things I‚Äôd say need improvement are: (1) the coffee in the room: it was poor quality instant coffee in a sachet, which didn‚Äôt taste good, and (2) the sheets still felt a bit damp. It did make my sleep a little less great, but not to the point of it ruining my stay. It wasn‚Äôt due to the cold room as I‚Äôve not had this issue in previous hotels before regardless of cold AC or even during winter season. Drying the sheets better would be great. And (3) the music by the pool was too loud, especially as the staff keeps the door open (probably to keep the DJ feel cool as it is hot outside, though keeping the door open means more energy consumption, which isn‚Äôt very good for the environment and overhead costs). I know I did take the time to point out these 3 issues. Nevertheless, it was a great experience overall, as you can see from the positives I‚Äôve enumerated above.

The morning buffet has a great selection - but food temperatures were not good.  Most items warm at best - with some cold.  Very bad for bacterial growth.  
Guests wearing pyjamas should not be allowed in any restaurant - but permitted here.

The TV channel listing in the room was extremely out of date.  I actually went through the entire channels available on the TV and updated the list and provided it to guest services.  Quite a few channels were missing, but I did find three new ones.  Only foreign news channel is CNN.

It's not because I loved my stay but because I always give benefit of the doubt that maybe the hotel will improve i.e. odor will be resolved the next time I stay here. Unfortunately, its just the same everytime. The bathroom wreaked.. the lobby had a musty odor- it is so evident because you can tell the difference when you come from outside or when you come from a very nice smelling hotel like holiday inn.. I paid twice the amount of holiday inn's nightly rate and  i think its just because of location. The buffet was awful. Food wasnt great. coffee was the worst. The muesli I had was spoiled. The food was mediocre.. its very disappointing. The amount you pay for doesnt equate to the quality of goods and hotel they offer to guests. The hotel needs deep cleaning for sure not just externally but internally.

653421160,"I first stayed at this hotel some years ago when it was part of the Marriot chain. It seems to have declined a lot since then. But first, there are a number of good things to say about the Seda Ayala: The beds are comfortable, the elevators are quick, there is good hot water in the shower, the buffet breakfasts are quite good, the internet works, and the reception, housekeeping, technical, and restaurant staff are all friendly and efficient. (Mr Steven at reception went out of his way to make up for problems with the hotel which were not of his own making  - he should be a manager one day). However, on the downside: the central air-con system makes the rooms way too cold and there is little one can do to deal with this. Way too cold to be healthy and I had to go and buy extra clothing to survive (my coconut oil turned to a solid in the room). The bathroom is not fantastic: slippery floors, especially in the shower area; bidets were not working (but were promptly fixed when requested). The room itself (Deluxe) was adequate, but a bit drab with depressing, dark, abstract prints, no chairs for the dining table, a very narrow working space, and a smoke detector with a permanent flashing red light beside the bed. From an environmental perspective, little consideration has been given to reducing single-use plastics: the usual suspects are found in the bathroom and with the drinking water. The room service menu is very limited with some items not available. The restaurant is focused on buffet meals and offers little else. The wine selection is limited and not very good quality. Sadly, it seems that the excellent restaurant serving staff does not receive the ""service charges"" that customers are required to pay with their food bills. So, in summary, this hotel is a mixed bag that requires serious attention from the owners to bring it back to at least some of its former glory. For the time being, there is much better value to be had at other venues.",7.6,2023-05-22T04:51:00+07:00

I ordered the Baby Back Ribs with Mango Salsa. But the server brought me Grilled Salmon Fillet. I said no to it. Then she came back saying - it's on the house ma'am as per our chef.

In June 2021, we were 10 days in this quarantine hotel and it was a nightmare. Staff were simply just overwhelmed with the COVID protocols and we were left like prisoners in a cage, nobody answers the phone. The food served (full board) was not so good. The rooms were not cleaned.
However, the staff are now much friendlier, the breakfast buffet is VERY GOOD and the rooms are just clean ",8.0,2022-04-07T09:50:00+07:00

485354882,The room was not cleaned as thoroughly as one would expect from this category of hotel. The room boy left night tables askew and did not wash the coffee mugs and teaspoon after I used them. My wife dropped something under the night table and when I looked I discovered a lot of dust underneath. The breakfast buffet was good but not great. In 4 days nothing was changed in the menu. ,8.8,2022-03-21T19:36:00+07:00

484973921,"I booked the hotel for my senior parents and the main guest was my father. And since the hotel room was for 2pax with free daily breakfast they called out my mom to pay in cash as my dad was the main guest and they were saying he can have 2 breakfast in one day which doesn't make sense since it was a buffet and my mom was able to check-in and was registered in the hotel as the 2nd guest. There was a misunderstanding and my parents told the restaurant about it that it was their daughter who booked the hotel for them through Agoda. We had to call the main reception to advise the restaurant about the incident as it was paid and the daily breakfast was for 2pax. It was an awkward scenario since they called out on my parents on the 2nd day already which was a bit embarrassing as they caused an unnecessary panic to my senior parents. The matter was resolved and we understand that it was an honest mistake however, it was completely unnecessary since they didn't double check first given that the guests (both of my parents) were registered and my mom was able to eat breakfast on her 1st day. 

Anyway, it was a nice hotel, spacious and clean with an access to the mall at their back gate.",9.2,2022-03-05T22:18:00+07:00
