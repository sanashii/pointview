802256120,"Stayed for 4 nights- couple with 3 young kids(ages 7-9) 

The good:
- Waterpark is great fun for the kids,
- Location is ideal - in the center of town - many shops and experiences around,
- AC in the room was at a steady 18C Hooray!!,
- They offer several water activities,
- Breakfast and dinner buffet are good,
- Staff is lovely,
- Drinks are delicious,
- The Coral restaurant is special - live music and good food and drinks,
- 4 restaurants to choose from or you can experience the restaurants right outside of the hotel
- The ‚Äúbeach‚Äù is rocky,  the kids spent a lot of time snorkeling.

The not so good:
- Room had a bit of funky smell,
- Found other‚Äôs people hair all over the room,
- Mattress was hard and pillows too soft and uncomfortable,
- Stayed in a large suite and no sofa bed in the living room area - had to pay extra $ per night for the extra bed,
- Water pressure is very weak and water suddenly stops when showering,
- AC keeps room cool but is extremely loud,- kept being awaken by the loud sounds, 
- There is a rooster in the neighborhood that woke us up from our already poor night sleep at 5:00am everyday,
- No kids club. They offer some sort of one on one babysitting for $75 per two hour session. 
- US prices for everything. Dollars are very much loved there. 

I say - Go if you have kids. They will love it. ",8.4,2024-05-04T02:28:00+07:00
801365149,"The waterpark is dated . Despite follow up for room cleaning, no one came to clean the room on the 2nd day. Beach is not your usual sandy shore. 

While staff is friendly., they don‚Äôt seem to know what to do. Requested for room extension up to 2pm to allow our children to tale a nap before our Pororo park schedule at 3pm.  Request was denied despite not having a lot of guests on Monday. ",6.8,2024-05-03T11:40:00+07:00
799093380,"""bitin"" is a term in Tagalog used when we feel like there are still so much more to enjoy but we just could not stay any longer. This is exactly how I describe our trip. Since it was an overnight stay only, there were so many more amenities we were not able to see and enjoy, especially the kids. Looking forward to our next stay, so we can time our stay better and make sure we get most of the experience we can have from this place. thanks",8.4,2024-04-30T01:21:00+07:00
798198428,"The Hotel is one of the better in the Philippines, absolute! But it is so much overpriced... We booked with 67% Discount, and still 13K a night (including a good breakfast Buffet). The Hotel is made for ""Stay Inside"". You have 5 (or more) Restaurants inside, a giant Poolside with 3 pools (one behind the J Tower). But also the pools... 1/4 of the poolside smells for diesel (because of the nightly fire show), 2/4 of the pools smells for septic tank...
But the most nagging is their Greediness! 30K for a night regular rate, and you are charged for extra 100 Pesos for using the wall plug in the business center!! 2.500 Pesos for a average Diner buffet, but you are charged for 100 Pesos extra for the Beer Tap. And at the end it is a philippino hotel: Faucets are ""flexible"", toilets out of order, seals of the bath tub let the showering water rinse down to the next flor... Overpriced. I think they don't want other Customers than Koreans, i think 90% of the guests are koreans, very nice, best hotel guests you can spend time with. And 90% of this are families with kids... sometimes loud kids. Multiply it with 100...",7.6,2024-04-29T01:03:00+07:00

791154583,Great Facilities and very good customer service! Make sure you check for promos before you book. Call or email to book the private villas!  I appreciate how most people are so modest with their swimwear being mostly fully covered up as this is a family resort. I do wish they provided more filipino food options in their bar menu as the Philippines does do filipino food best! This place has everything so you don't need to leave :) We were granted a free family photoshoot which I highly recommend! Fire dancing and live entertainment every night was fantastic.So grateful for the great hospitality üòäüôè,9.6,2024-04-06T11:03:00+07:00
789794983,"Stayed here for 4 nights and experience was awesome. Staff were friendly and warm and ensured that we had all we needed.

Rooms were big, clean, and comfortable.

Facilities inside were great and there were enough activities inside to make us happy. The beach was awesome and my 5 year old son and my wife enjoyed snorkeling near the shore. Water activities were available too inside the resort and priced reasonably. 

Easy transfer to and from the airport via Grab. Same with going to Cebu City via the new expressway.

Only thing we didn't like was the food. It was just okay. There are options outside the hotel though.

Will come back again for sure. ",10.0,2024-04-03T12:29:00+07:00

776295863,"Aside from the perfect amenities the resort have, I highly recommend Jpark Island Resort and Waterpark because of the exceptional services of their staff (especially the housekeeping). I unfortunately left valuable items (my wedding and engagement rings) in my room when we checked out. We flew already back to Gensan after checking out when I realized my rings were left. I immediately called the hotel, and I was informed that the housekeeping staff turned over my rings. I truly admire the honesty that the housekeeping staff showed, and I highly commend their services. We look forward to staying again on the resort in the next couple of months.

772801877,"Had lots of fun here with my kids.  Lots of facilities but most are paid. Water park is fun. But a lot of guests put their beach towels on the beach or pool chairs before the pools are opened! And suppose the staff should monitor if chairs are unattended for an hour, but I didn't see this happening. I saw two men holding 9 towels placing one each on the chairs and left for 1.5 hours. 

Food at restaurants (we tried Korean and Japanese and coral seaside one) are expensive and so so only. I suggest you go out to grab food.",8.8,2024-02-17T10:18:00+07:00

578872714,"Overall had an amazing time at JPark. It‚Äôs a kids wonderland and seeing the joy on my kids faces was worth the money spent here. 

1) Room- mactan ocean view suite was large and roomy and had an amazing view. 2 bathrooms and a separate living area and bedroom area- much needed for a family of 4 for a week‚Äôs stay.  Note: for the very first night, we booked a deluxe room (cheaper) since we arrived at 3:30am. The deluxe room was not 5 star. The bathrooms looked dingy and the caulking was horrid. Hopefully all the deluxe rooms do not look like this. We were so happy to move to our mactan suite. 

2) spa - 5 star spa. I went twice to try two different packages. Highly recommend shynn. Her hands were magical. I left fully relaxed and highly recommend this spa. Gabby at front desk was also very nice and professional. 

3) food- abalone breakfast buffet- 5 star all the way. A multicultural breakfast buffet of Filipino, Korean, American, Japanese and a full pastry section. Only thing I‚Äôd recommend is to maybe have the expresso section be able to customize drinks. They make the most amazing lattes but don‚Äôt have the stuff to customize like caramel or chocolate :) special shout out to Jonathan for his amazing service.

note: we tried the coral,  Korean, Chinese, Japanese and all the pool bar food. Never had a bad experience. 

Housekeeping: very good 

Pororo cafe: nice but pricey for what it is. For the price we are paying per night, would be nice to have one free play time. 

d-thrones: the mini scooter car rentals for kids . 300 pesos for 30 minutes. So fun and worth it.

Babysitting: there are babysitters who offer care at the pool area while parents can relax. They all seem to offer different rates but it‚Äôs very affordable. Tip them well. They do a great job to actually give the parents a relaxing vacation as well . It seemed about 50 percent of the guests were aware of this service and used babysitters. 500 pesos is paid to the hotel to host them for the day at the resor",8.4,2022-12-31T02:21:00+07:00

577744591,"Our overall experience was great. Food is a little bit pricey so this hotel is not for those who are on a tight budget traveller. There are restaurants nearby though. Pororo park was a great experience for our young one. Although in my opinion, 1500 is too much for just two hours of playing. It would be nice to make it free for those who are staying the property. Overall, the waterpark is great and the food is superb. They have all kinds of dishes and all are delicious.

JPark is one of a must try hotel if you're visiting cebu and if you have children and want to give them a great Cebu experience.

Thank you to everyone for your hospitality!

577100196,I wanted to book at Agoda a villa room but only Mactan Suite room is available so I needed to upgrade when I check in and good thing that there's available villa. There's a lot you can do here which is worth your money. Maybe this only applies to me but my only concern was that the villa (not sure if other rooms as well) and public restrooms doesn't have a bidet so I needed to request for pail and dipper but they only got dipper and still a bit useless since there no faucet near the toilet (We'll be back again once I got a portable bidet).,10.0,2022-12-12T11:04:00+07:00

568133156,"The staff were great - smiles and friendly attitudes all around.
We stayed in 909-B (Deluxe Ocean View).
A/C in the lifts/elevators - but as soon as the doors open for your floor - whammo! - Heat and humidity, but it's not an open air hallway, so why not turn on the visible A/C units in the ceiling? 
Though the bed was comfortable, the room needs to be renovated - dated from the 1990's and the chase lounge in the room... the foam pad is so old it doesn't fit correctly into the cover and it's very uncomfortable - Bathroom has combined bath/shower. Very narrow bath that caused both of us to have a few near accidents.  Also, the drainage around the bath is poor and they rigged up a pipe under the counter to do this, but it's clogged and ran slow.
The breakfast buffet (madhouse) is mediocre at best.  Food temps too low - eggs cold - not warm - cold.  ""Juices"" are some sort of powered mix - no signs of any bits of fruit in them.  If you want bacon ask one of the roaming chefs around the buffet - they keep it in the back to avoid the stampede.
The staff are the real reason for the success of this property - management need to bring this hotel into the 2020's.
Would we stay here again?... Perhaps, but not until the place was renovated.

One from the negative points is that I asked for an iron 4 times but each time they kept telling me that theres only 2 and currently under use, i dont know how such a huge resort contains only 2 irons.
The breakfast buffet contain many varieties but related to Filipino food, i think they need to add a section for international food as well.
Theres 6 restaurants inside that resort but not all of them are open, also they open at a specifc time only either during lunch time or during dinner. After 9:30 pm theres norhing you can do in this resort.",5.6,2022-11-28T03:14:00+07:00

The suite‚Äôs aircon has water droplets also but not as bad as our first room. The storage is a little bit dusty, saw a spider and a cockroach in the comfort room also. 

The staff are very accomodating, courteous and helpful. They provide all the assistance that we need. Special mention to Jinalyn. 

We are disappointed with the breakfast buffet. The food are either too salty, too oily, bland or have plenty of cornstarch slurry. Only the breads are good. Restaurants inside the hotel are good though especially Nonki - the Japanese restaurant and the J lounge.

Close to what you would expect from a 5-star hotel  for this price- our children love the place and spend their whole time in the 3 swimming pools so I will focus here only on (smallish) ""opportunities for improvement""... Staff very polite and accomodating but takes five calls (same last time) and 3 or 4 hours to get them install the additional bed, even though already requested at check-in time. Don't hesitate to call 0 several time to get what you need... Drinkable water supply commitment is unclear. Ridiculous smallish bottles provided once per day (if you are here to remind them how many you are in the room when they clean up). Better walk to 7/11 300 meters away and buy 10 liters bottles of mineral water... No bidet spray on the toilet bowl, does it have to be the European way?

519005182,Its good for families especially with children as it has waterpark and place for children which they will enjoy. But there has been nothing special in the hotel. I even informed then am celebrating my moms 80th birthday but no surprises from them. They should improve and be considerate people check in with celebration. I am not asking for room upgrade because i book two bedroom suite. My concern like small cake and singing to my mom in j lounge where we had dinner. But nothing even when we arrive in the room ‚ò∫Ô∏è. But in general very clean and nice food üëèüèª  ,9.2,2022-06-16T07:39:00+07:00

490436406,"For Family it is indeed a paradise, the pool activities/amenities caters the kids and Teenies craving for fun just like the water world in Europe. The Beach has a romantic flare... We just missed it coz of the rain during our stay. Snorkling is fun, they provide lifevest for uncertain one, so just have some fun. Sadly typhoon Odeth just visited the area before us and damage not only parts of the property but the reef also, it deprive us of diving also. Maybe next time when we visited again.

The only thing that bothers me is  the streets going there. I know Cebu is very famous of her small street.. Goodness can't their LGU make a one way of this streets?  Considering the Standard it is a one lane street luckily everybody accepts the 2 way purpose. So if you don't have the nerve to ride a car in this area better leave it... I've accepted the challenge but with la lot of cursing. Don't worry! Only my passenger heard them all.

If you only stay at the resort then everything is fine.  If you want to roam around I'd rather suggest to know their public transportation network or hail a cab or grab(√ºber). ",8.4,2022-04-15T10:18:00+07:00

485195499,The parks facilities are okay. The food is over priced but its a resort. The biggest issues is the manager at the front had no knowledge how to get a Taxi for guest. First remark was its because we have our own car service and we dont use cell phones up here. Well that was a lie I looked on the desk and everyone had a cell phone sitting at the desk. They just want to make money by ripping u off on their high rate for car service. They acted like their was no way to get a taxi unless by chance they were dropping another guest off. I have stayed several hotels in close proximity of this resort and never had this issue. One they are liars two they almost force u to utilize their car service. The individual we spoke to the day before said their were no shuttles we can utilize the following day its funny be cause the day i left they said it had to be booked in advance. Staff is not trained and I find the experience stresful. I would not stay here again. ,3.6,2022-03-15T00:56:00+07:00
485195507,I have stayed at multiple resorts in the same location and have had great trips. The over all facility is nice. My issue is they hold you hostage to utilize their car for transportation. They act as if they do not have numbers to reach any of the local taxi companies. I find that odd because I stayed at two other resorts the past weeks and they all were able to easily book a taxi for me. They just kept saying they dont have that option because they have their own cars. I felt like a hostage. I would never stay in this hotel again based off that experience. ,4.4,2022-03-15T00:51:00+07:00

483601887,"I arrived 2:30pm with luggages and people blocking the lobby. I managed to filter my way through when I was directed to the front desk. The front desk was like a bus station, with several lines zig zagging around sofas. 

I queued for almost 2 hours. When I eventually got to the desk dehydrated and tired. No water, no welcome drinks. Just a long line to greet me. When I tried to check in, even though I paid upfront a few weeks ago. They advised me to wait for my room to be ready. I asked for the manager, they said maybe I can speak to the duty manager at 7pm! 

I eventually got my room, which was nice. Just shame the management seems oblivious about the first impressions of guests as he/she is missing from the action. 

I encountered other incidences such as no towels at 9am by the pool and told to come back in an hours time. And having to pay cash for facilities IN the hotel. 

The front line staff were pleasant but overwhelmed with the people. 

I would recommend not checking in on time if you do choose here. And carry cash around. ",8.0,2022-02-27T18:54:00+07:00
