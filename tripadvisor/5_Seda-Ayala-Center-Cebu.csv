Tony C,Jan 2024,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Price doesn’t match the quality and service. ,Not worth the price. The price does not match the service and quality.  Moldy ceiling in bathroom with rusted trash can. Water stains everywhere.  Service at the restaurant was sub par with very rude and uncaring staff.  Could barely get a coffee with breakfast and no creamer offered or provided.  No one available to seat us but then rude when we tried to seat ourselves. Sub par selections at breakfast (not even bacon?).  All the bread was either stale or overcooked.

theSHYexplorers,Oct 2023,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Exceptionally situated, but marred by the unpleasant odor of the hallway carpets.","I stayed for two nights in a room that offered views of Ayala Terraces and the pool area. The hotel lobby features a waiting area where guests can use a complimentary desktop PC for making future bookings. However, our experience was marred by an unpleasant and musty odor emanating from the carpets throughout the entire property. I strongly suggest that they consider either replacing or removing these carpets to enhance the overall quality of the facilities. Despite the age of the building, there is definitely room for improvement.The hotel's location, adjacent to Ayala Terraces, proves to be convenient for accessing Ayala Mall. Additionally, there is a small pool with a bar; however, the music from the pool bar can be quite disruptive for those who are seeking rest after a long and exhausting flight. It would be advisable for them to take measures to reduce the noise levels.",November 2022,NA

Gregg F,Aug 2023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice time ant the Seda Ayala hotel,"Stopped in after a week of business travel for some relaxation.  The hotel is located in the heart of Cebu City next to a very nice mall. Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn’t turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I was doing while there and making sure I was happy.  Thank you Mary. Lastly I wanted to call out the wonderful breakfast buffet with foods from many culture as well as a very nice and attentive staff. It was a really nice stay and look forward to staying there again.",August 2023,NA

Jess S,Aug 2023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for families,"Stayed here twice on separate occasions during our recent holiday in Cebu. Staff were very friendly throughout the duration of both our stays. Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn’t get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.We stayed in room 915 which had a nice view of the city/mall and room 703 with an ok view.

Our room is always nicely made up by our cleaners Rafgi and Julu!Food needs improvement though.   The congee is inconsistent, sometimes watery n sometimes thick.  There need to be a better toaster for breads that couldn't fit on slice bread slots.

Gregg F,Aug 2023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice time ant the Seda Ayala hotel,"Stopped in after a week of business travel for some relaxation.  The hotel is located in the heart of Cebu City next to a very nice mall. Firstly, the staff is really nice and helpful here. The ladies at the front desk helped us multiple times with finding places and making dinner reservations. The hotel is older with faded carpet, but is still quite nice and very clean. The best part is the room air conditioning works great and doesn’t turn off in the middle of the night like some other hotels.  When going into the Club Lounge, Mary was always there with a big smile and offered a little chit chat asking how the day went or how dinner was.  As a traveler with elite status at multiple hotel chains, I always appreciate that personal touch like remembering my name and the things I was doing while there and making sure I was happy.  Thank you Mary. Lastly I wanted to call out the wonderful breakfast buffet with foods from many culture as well as a very nice and attentive staff. It was a really nice stay and look forward to staying there again.",August 2023,NA

Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table. Beds are comfortable. Rooms are reasonably clean however the bathrooms could use a deep clean, visible mould in the shower, basin, bidet hose, and rusty garbage bin. There is a mini fridge in the rooms however they didn’t get very cold even after trying to adjust the settings.We stayed in room 915 which had a nice view of the city/mall and room 703 with an ok view.

Plus, I also saw a hotel guest ( teenager)  today (July 13, 2023) wearing pajamas and having her breakfast.  It appears that it is an extension of her home living room.

Well, after thorough dialogue with her, her top manager offered us a discount of our stay so I told everybody to just stay  say what happens. So, we prolonged our stay until even today inspite of calling service that towels were not enough, had to cal more toilet paper  even empty body wash was not replaced. I had to call service twice cuz the net fix our w/c got stuck up for some reasons we don’t know. Maybe previous occupants throw something there that they should not.

Dang git not fried where it is crisp so cannot eat it.also they serve salted ones.Housekeeping needs quality checks. I do not see or hear vacuuming done so guests come in dusty unclean areas. Linens spotted. Stuff shortages as one waits for rooms to be refreshed. For two days now I see one staff responsible for the whole floor of rooms. The only draw here is location as with kids the mall is the destination area and us old folks hate to cross the busy street so we settle for this place.

This hotel fails to impress me. The first time i stayed there was no internet.  This second time,  i was given a room with an adjoining room,  divides by one of those creepy doors,  where you don't know its secure. Why in the world you don't know who i am,  my first lousy experience,  then you put me here in this room. The guy next door waa snoring in my ear and his TV blasting all night. The front desk tries hard and work hard,  as do support staff.  I suspect the problem ia management. My CR had no shower glass or curtain divider. That made the shower water cover the entire CR.  What kind of hotel does this to a customer???!! This is just stupid Gwen.!! How would you like to walk around in wet like you're at a swimming pool. It also takes 30 mins to run the water to a warm temperature! The food at the buffet was cold,  not warm,  many dishes were not heated.  This hotel is good for one thing.  Location to the mall and shopping entertainment and food. But the hotel is far below it's good looks. Thats all it is.  Aside from the decore,  youre taking your chances.

She has been very prompt with her replies and very proactive. She went above and beyond to accomodate me and that left a very lasting impression on my end. I can't thank her enough :) My mom raved on how great and accomodating the staff were, how systematic everything was from airport pick up, to check in and how delicious the food was! She loves how comfortable and homey the room was, a much needed comfort after long hours of flying and travelling. Finally, when my mom received her results after 24 hrs, she was able to check out a day early, the staff printed the results for her, arranged the hotel transportation and dropped her off at our home at no extra charge. She was even refunded for the extra night that she had booked. I can't be more happy and impressed with SEDA Ayala.

Ian Michael C,May 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best place to be stranded during the Pandemic,"Stayed at Room 906 for over a month. During the lockdown we stayed at Seda Hotel, the service alone was exceptional, but efforts of the hotel to insure our safety and security is above and beyond. Upon entering the lobby social distancing was mandated  by bell persons and security staffs, body temperature and identification data will be checked upon entering and leaving the hotel which makes us feel very safe. They also spray disinfectant at the entrance and automated sanitizer spray is available at the hotel premises.  Rotational body temperature check was done politely by the hotel nurses and the Front desk did a good job with updating us with some important notifications of the hotel.  From the bottom of my heart, I would like to thank the hotel housekeeping staffs KELLY, JUSTIN and GRACE T for  addressing our needs and for keeping our room clean and tidy, kudos to these folks 🙏",May 2020,NA

I commend the staff especially Ivy at the front desk for possessing so much grace under pressure and for being kind and warm to every guest, regardless of skin color, outfit or demeanor. By not profiling according to initial impressions. Seda Vertis North for instance is notorious for privileging guests in business or moneyed appearance not realizing that guest who may wear the most simple clothes have more moolah to spare.

The breakfast is unique and the outdoor area is quite nice for a city like Cebu. Sourronded by a Mall which is very normal in Cebu. To spent time in a Mall because outside is office buildings or Ghetto. You cannot walk in the streets. They have no Spa which would be a nice add on. Staff is very helpful. But when you expect good recommendations for the nice spots in the city they do not tell. For this better stay in hostels. They are super new and with the cool crowd.",October 2019,NA

Assistance on arrival took forever getting our luggage taken cared of, check-in was not desirable as you already feel that they are not willing to assist you or make your stay extra special - each question gets shut down, they do not allow you to borrow towels - wanted to go island hopping as Cebu is quite well known for this, yet they will want you to purchase your towels to use while doing so.  Makes you wonder if this is a hotel or not!I just hope the service improves.  I only checked in last night and been here just less than 12hrs, and will be here for a few more days.I just stayed at their hotel in Bacolod, and the staff there were far more accommodating and friendly than Cebu.

(2) a lapse in housekeeping made me return to a room with a used teacup, unreplenished  supply of teabags.

travelerkj81,Sep 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent location,"Seda Hotel used to be Marriot Hotel. Let me start with the good points. The location, couldn’t ask for a better place, I prefer Ayala Center vs. SM which was a clincher for me in choosing which hotel to stay at. Definitely convenient walk to Ayala Center. I had the club lounge access which was worth it because I didn’t have to deal with a crowd during breakfast and loved the cocktail hour perks. Breakfast food was superb, limited options but nevertheless very tasty. The staff, very nice and courteous. They addressed all requests without a problem. As far as the “not so good” points... the fridge in my room didn’t get that cold and it became a problem when storing leftovers. Also on our first night, a/c wasn’t working up to par. We called maintenance which they tried to fix but it took a while for temperature to get to ideal level, so the first night was slightly warm. I think the issues stemmed from the fact that the structure isn’t brand new, hence, there are probably pre-existing issues. Having said that, the issues were minor and I would still consider staying at Seda.",September 2019,NA

I did not get to use the outdoor path as it was raining yesterday afternoon and evening.  It was so convenient for me - I bought my ""pasalubong"" at the Metro Supermarket and the bagger brought my box all the way to the hotel.  The hotel personnel even offered to store my ""pasalubong"" box in their storage room so that I did not have to bring it up all the way to my room only to be carried down again the next day when I check out.    I forgot my room key inside the room and the front desk quickly gave ma a 3rd room key.  The breakfast buffet was also good - so many choices and they served Cebu delicacies such as chorizo de cebu, dilis, danggit and lapis squid.

Apart from the good amenities, a hotel's staff warm accommodation is what I value more. Although I miss Marriott's excellent sensitivity to their guests, the Seda staff are not far behind (maybe because they are relatively young as opposed to the seasoned staff of the former hotel).

In this day and change when our oceans and rivers are being clogged with endless waves of plastic and whales are washing up on shore with bellies full of discarded plastic waste...Seda is adding more waste to that problem by choosing to serve guests with plastic.

While the location has always been fantastic I just always thought there were better hotel rates for the Ayala location.   So I tried Seda last month and have to say it was a solid experience.   The check in desk was wonderful and were able to accommodate me a few hours early as I flew in from New York and Hong Kong which was great after 22 hours of travel.  I did notify the desk ahead of time.   The common areas are clean and look great.   The rooms while smaller than say Radisson were clean and nicely appointed, bed was comfy, and despite some other comments very quiet.  I didn't hear through the walls and I'm a light sleeper.   The breakfast buffet was quite good and I had read mixed previous comments on it but the food and service was solid.   Location as everyone knows is fantastic.   The staff everywhere was great.   If I had to nit pick I could maybe say the gym was a bit dated but at least they have a gym.   I think Seda is the best hotel for the Ayala location though the rates are higher than others but I think it was worth it.   It's still not at the level of Radisson but Seda's rates are not as high and its a different location so its not really fair compare.   So net net, I would recommend and if I saw a good rate I would stay again for sure.",February 2019,NA

The machines were old and needed to be upgraded.  Machines were still working but wear and tear is visible.  It's like the hotel bought used equipment.  One thing that really irked us was when my wife complained to the resident manager about the swimming pool.  (pool attendant was allowing t-shirt worn in the pool).  The manager called us and told us she spoke with the pool attendant and that the pool attendant insisted the guest was wearing a dry fit shirt.  My wife is in the garments business and I think we would know what dry fit and non fit is  thank you very much.   Instead of consoling us as guest and just say ""will look into the problem"", the manager insisted that her pool attendant was correct in his decision making   (POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TRAINING)  .

The close proximity to my office was needed whilst working the “graveyard” shift. With this in mind it was a little disappointing that room service finished at 12 so we had to pre-order food which was left for several hours before we collected at reception on our return from work. As mentioned in previous reviews on here, there are no chairs in the room so eating food in the room was a little tricky as you have to move the configuration of the table and settee around to eat at the table. The rooms are spacious and the staff are helpful, but at the time of my visit I understand that the hotel was on “soft” opening due to the refurbished. On summary a well located hotel for a business trip, and I hope to return one day",November 2018,NA
Paul S,Dec 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A Perfect Place to Stay for Business in Cebu!,"I've stayed at several hotels in/around Cebu over the last 2 years and I will definitely be going back to the Seda Ayala Center. The only problem I had was that for a business trip, a room with no desk chair and no clock seemed rather strange. When I asked about the chair I was told I could ""sit up in bed"" or they could send up a chair from banqueting (which they did!). Otherwise the hotel is great ... except that there was no signage anywhere for the gym in the basement. The restaurant is terrific, service from all the staff was A+ and next time I just hope not to be chairless in Cebu!",December 2018,NA
ShaunDayle,Dec 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,It's definitely no longer the Marriott!,When I stayed here in the past it was under the Marriott brand. The re-branding and remodeling leave a bit to be desired. It is missing a lot of the feel that made it a comfortable go-to when I travel to Cebu. The rooms are a bit smaller than before with fewer amenities. The Misto restaurant offers fewer food selections as well. It is no longer kid friendly. My son was a bit happy to be there and was a bit loud in the morning. We promptly received a call from the front desk to quiet down our 2 year old son. The magic is gone for me. I doubt I'll ever book another stay at this hotel.,November 2018,NA
efrenr916,Dec 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great dining,"Filipino  Continental menu, filling servings, tasty, fresh meat, seafoods, veggies  fruits. Friendly, helpful and quick service. Great breakfast buffet also. Nice cozy ambiance good for business meetings or just dining.",December 2018,NA
damianAU,Dec 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Stayed 8 days, staff exceptional. ",Just completed a stay of 8 days. The staff are excellent. When they found out our daughter was having a birthday the brought her a cake and sang happy bday in the restaurant. The hotel is clean and professional. I made good use of the gym which has a wide range of equipment.  They just need a proper barbell and squat station to complete it. Breakfast didnt have a huge selection but it was very good. One thing i didnt like was no carpet in our room. The lobby is lovely and the back exit to ayala centre is very convenient.  I would guess the thing that makes it so expensive is the proximity to ayala mall. Overall our stay was enjoyable and we hope to be back.,November 2018,NA
Fritz S,Nov 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Misto, a new restaurant in Cebu",We always try out new restaurants. That's why we wanted to test the buffet in the newly opened restaurant. It was an ambivalent experience. The food was nicely represented and rich. Too bad that most of the dishes were cold. We sat in the lower part of the restaurant. Only at the end of the meal a waiter came to clear the different plates.,November 2018,NA
kimmy671,Nov 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Right next to the mall!,"I stayed at this hotel when it was the Marriott, and so I recommended that my family stay here when we had to go to Cebu for a funeral. Our trip wasn't meant for sightseeing or a beach vacation, but we also needed a place where we would be close to lots of restaurants and a grocery store (Rustan's Supermarket), and a spa (to deal with the jet lag). Unfortunately, the gym and business center were not yet ready, as Seda was still in the process of renovating. Because of our schedule, our main meal of the day was breakfast, and it was really good. I was able to enjoy my favorite breakfast foods, such as congee, fried fish (danggit and dilis), and tocino. You can also order eggs the way you like it, though the cooks struggled to understand that I like my eggs cooked to the point of being burnt, with more brown than yellow (Ha!). I just brought my plate back and asked them to cook my flat omelettes more, and then they were perfect. I really liked what Seda was doing to the place. It was brighter in the lobby than when it was the Marriott, and the staff were helpful and courteous. Since the Ayala Center Cebu is practically my favorite hangout whenever I go to Cebu, this hotel location gets top marks from me.",November 2018,NA
Vangie M,Nov 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Redeemed Noon,"We were having a not so good day when we were checking in due to an airport staff. My moms burberry luggage was sooking wet when we reclaimed it from the carousel.  Non of the Philippine Airlines staff even the supervisor cannot give us a clear direction on what to do. But upon entrance to Seda Hotel our moods changed due to very courteous lobby personnel, attendants and front desk officers, immediately greeted us with a smile and respectful gestures.Checking in was a breeze, so little did we expect to have checked in as early as 12Noon, for its not a Hotel's standard check in time. I was even so respectfully asking for a favor to check in even in 1 out of 3 rooms we are having. I was delighted when I was informed that all our rooms were all ready and we can check in once we are done with the procedures. Over all it was indeed an experienced a best one actually to have chosen this Hotel. We are looking forward being here for the rest of 3 days. Lobby was tastefully decorated for Christmas, I must admit that I love seeing Christmas Decors and I am in awe with this not so big and extravagant lobby yet homey and elegant in style.Highly recommended to its proximity to Ayala Malls. Very convenient location and despite its the City, I found it not so crowded and a breeze to anyone who used to living in one.Read more",November 2018,NA
Philip T,Nov 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location for business ,"It’s my first time in this hotel, the location is perfect for business trip, room is comfortable and nice, except no chair for the table inside the room, no toilet bidet, unpleasant odor when you start the air conditioner few minutes. Nevertheless all of the staffs are nice and very attentive, from the lobby attendant, front desk thru the receptionist from the cafe, great food also! Will surely come back at this hotel, great job!",November 2018,NA
Char,Nov 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great location and service,"I use to stay in this same hotel when it was still under Marriot. I always love staying here because of the location and service. With the new Seda brand, interiors have been upgraded with a zen minimalist vibe. Service is still great. One thing I would hoped they kept is the smoking area that use to be just outside the restaurant. Now it’s situated at the far end of the pool",November 2018,NA
Julia D,Nov 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent food and Ethical Staff,The food my family and I ordered didn't fail to amaze my tastebuds' satisfaction. Everything is freshly cooked. The staffs are well-attended to our needs and are also very approachable. I'd go back here sooner and recommend Seda Hotel.,November 2018,NA
