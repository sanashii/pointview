Daniel G,Jan 2024,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Reliable staff,The staff was very friendly and helpful. They responded to emails I sent ahead of my trip to coordinate pickup from the airport for my family of 5 and they were waiting for us when we got off the plane. They were also great coordinating the rest of the transportation I needed which was very useful because Cebu is not the easiest city to get around with small children.

The breakfast and dinner buffets always have a good selection of nice foods. Staff regularly inspect the food and always check on you to top up your coffee or water. I found the staff to be very well trained and diligent in their jobs. The wifi works well everywhere with good speed.

Patrick B,Jan 2024,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Life savers!!,"The staff was incredibly nice and really funny. Always a very authentic smile, the service was honestly better than some of the hotels I've been to in the U.S. I stayed in the premium suite, and in my opinion it's very worth the money. Great view of the sunrise and the city. And super close to the mall and some really great massage parlors in the area. And the Buffett they offer is incredible! Though I'd include that Into the cost of your room ahead of time if possible. By some unavoidable events, I lost my wallet and my phone was severely water damaged. However, in the same situation, by the grace of God, Maruy (I think I got her name right) was able to pull some strings so I could have enough money to cover my room and still get a cab to the airport. If not for her and the amazing staff in front, I would have been in an impossible situation. I'd easily go back to visit knowing I'd be in good hands, highly recommend to anyone looking for a second home while on vacation.",October 2023,NA

KM M,Sep 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,You need to upgrade!,"This is my second stay at this hotel, and there have been some changes since my last visit in 2019. Firstly, the absence of water bottles should have been communicated to us before our stay so we could have brought our own. Secondly, there was a strong unpleasant odor from the carpet as soon as you left the elevator on the 16th floor. Thirdly, I encountered small roaches in my bedroom week beginning September 28, and on my chair in the buffet area on September 9. Fourthly, there seems to be a miscommunication issue between the front desk and the department responsible for in-room calls. I requested that my room be cleaned during my absence at night for work, but they continued to call, disrupting my sleep. The only person who consistently provided excellent service was Kuya Eric at the breakfast buffet. He has a unique way of making customers feel special and delighted to be served by him.",September 2023,NA

carolyn n,Jun 2023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,MEMORABLE STAY,"Stayed at Quest Hotel last month for 6days. The whole time was amazing!!! From picking us at the airport to the hotel , very professional in every way!! We booked a pick up and we were met by their representative at the arrival and escorted us to the van where  the driver was waiting with a big smile!!! Upon the check in, the front desk(Nat and all) was so attentive, accommodating and made us feel so welcome !! Room is great and being clean everyday unless you don't want to.  We can hear the housekeeper singinging while doing their task and made my day more beautiful. Breakfast is so yummy lots to choose from and they made you feel special that you want to stay forever as well as the buffet dinner. Shout out to all the servers, Mark , Anton, Franz, Kate, Jessa and more (sorry I wasn't able to get all the names) Especial mention to  the captain chef - ( I was getting a rice soup and the green onion was out and I don't mind , returned to my table , 5 minutes later he (THE CAPTAIN CHEF) brought me a chopped green onion) what really amazed me was he came out from the kitchen and looked for me - he really did an extra mile.... For exploring make sure to talk to the concierge (Roniel and Ethan) and will provide you a good rate for exploring Cebu and  ask for ARNEL to drive you around!! Poolside is a great spot to have your wine and pizza!! Thank you all for making our stay a memorable one. We'll be back and absolutely recommend your hotel to our friends.",May 2023,NA

I always enjoy my stay here because everyone is so friendly and accommodating. This is the first time I had a problem with my room and I went to the front desk and the manager (Miriam) resolved it better than I expected. Sir Victor and his concierge staff always treats me well and with respect and makes me feel like a VIP. Also, Ma'am Carmela and the housekeeping staff are always smiling and greet me every time they see me that it really brightens my day. One thing I would change though is to make the television more simple. My room had 4 remote controls and it was very confusing. This hotel is centralized and right next to Ayala mall which is very convenient. The pool is nice but there is a cost if you bring an extra guest but you receive half of the cost in consumables, which was nice. The hotel is a 3 star hotel but the staff makes me feel like I'm in a 5 star hotel. I will definitely stay here again.",May 2023,NA

From picking us at the airport to the hotel , very professional in every way!! We booked a pick up and we were met by their representative at the arrival and escorted us to the van where  the driver was waiting with a big smile!!! Upon the check in, the front desk(Nat and all) was so attentive, accommodating and made us feel so welcome !! Room is great and being clean everyday unless you don't want to.  We can hear the housekeeper singinging while doing their task and made my day more beautiful. Breakfast is so yummy lots to choose from and they made you feel special that you want to stay forever as well as the buffet dinner. Shout out to all the servers, Mark , Anton, Franz, Kate, Jessa and more (sorry I wasn't able to get all the names) Especial mention to  the captain chef - ( I was getting a rice soup and the green onion was out and I don't mind , returned to my table , 5 minutes later he (THE CAPTAIN CHEF) brought me a chopped green onion) what really amazed me was he came out from the kitchen and looked for me - he really did an extra mile.... For exploring make sure to talk to the concierge (Roniel and Ethan) and will provide you a good rate for exploring Cebu and  ask for ARNEL to drive you around!! Poolside is a great spot to have your wine and pizza!! Thank you all for making our stay a memorable one. We'll be back and absolutely recommend your hotel to our friends.",May 2023,NA

The location is great to get to Ayala mall if you need any groceries or personal items. Special acknowledgment to Cindy Alcantara! She was so helpful with one of our concerns and she was able to get it resolved so quickly! She also helped get my family and friends stay close together at Quest Hotel.

We are balikbayans from NZ and had come home after 20 years living overseas. Right from the beginning we had experienced great service from airport pick up and the front desk staff were amazing dealing with us at midnight to check us all in. We were provided rooms all on the same level which was fantastic. Our rooms were cleaned everyday and housekeeping always made sure our needs were met. Mildred and her staff were just so kind and hard working. Room service, Christian and Carl, always came with a big smile on their faces and made sure we were fed the food we had wanted. Liam the security guard also made sure we had the right amount of taxis (or a big van) to transport us to our activities everyday. Quest has fantastic facilities including the gym, pool and pool bar. We got to know the staff and felt like this was our home for three weeks. We will definitely be back on our next visit. THANK YOU QUEST .",December 2022,NA

One time,  I went out and when I got back to the hotel, I was carrying a bag full of groceries lol, one of the staff on night shift just took my bag and offered to walk me going to our room. One of the things I love as well is the staffs always greet you with a smile. Then every breakfast, a crew named Dan, he is so kind and attentive. He always make sure we have a lovely breakfast, not just him, all the crew actually. We had a lovely stay bec of u guys! My aunt, uncle and cousins are now on Egypt.

The location of the hotel is quiet close to my destination as well as some other business centers in the city.

She honored my request for high floor and overlooking the pool. Beautiful staff in the restaurant and I must say the breakfast was superb. Staff in the barista named Gerald  is also great. Thank you also to the gorgeous lady Zyl for swiftly processing my check out. Lots of small things add up to the best imaginable hotel stay.

Everytime we go back home from overseas we always choose quest hotel. Previously the staffs were very friendly, respectful and honest. The managers were accomodating, responsive with issues and kind. NO COMPLAINTS AT ALL!!! We were happy and we even recommend it to a lot of our friends.  UNFORTUNATELY 2020 we stayed for total of 2 weeks and WE WILL NEVER COMING BACK AGAIN. Security guards are very rude and disrespectful. The manager is rude and doesnt know how to address guests issues properly that i dont even know how he became manager. Ignorant. Arrogant and thinks highly of himself and discrimates. Quest is totally different now. They have failed our expectation. Management has poor service and very unprofessional!

We had some trouble with our AC in our first room which they resolved right away by transferring us to another room. All our queries were answered right away. They even called us to check if we were gonna have our breakfast at the restaurant for a breakfast buffet (only every weekends) or if we would rather have our breakfast in our room via room service. It was indeed a great stay made possible by amazing staff who treated us like we were royalty. There's really nothing bad i can say about our stay and i only wish i got the names of their reception staff to give them a shout out.

Ryan,Nov 2019,1.0 of 5 bubbles,There's far better places in Cebu to stay.,"Me and my wife wanted to try a different resort this time around and after searching, we found Quest Hotel. The photo's online make this hotel look amazing. That said, it's substantially Photoshoped. After flying nearly 20 hours and finally getting to the hotel, we checked in. The rep at the front counter misinformed us about a shuttle that will take you to the local malls. The do NOT have one. After getting into the room, we found that the bet was made up with dirty soiled sheets (photo's attached). Additionally, the floors were dirty (also in the photos) and there were stains on the counter (also in the photo's). Upon bringing this to their attention, we were greeted with a smile and apology and advised it would be taken care of. The sheets were changed but the floors were never cleaned and the stains remained. I spoke to Joy (night manager) and she advised that it would be taken care of and offered to comp us breakfast for 2 days of the 8+ we were there. Issues were never resolved. A couple of days before we left, they neglected to but tissues (of any sort) in the bathroom. I went down and spoke to Vince who was able to assist in getting the tissues. The second part of our stay, they put us in a far smaller room (despite our having paid for a deluxe room). Lastly, the air conditioning struggles to keep up with the heat and does not do a good job of cooling the rooms. Additionally, the AC unit is above the bed and leaked water all over the bed. We had to call and get them to come and replace the sheets. I and my wife will not be staying here again and would urge others to seek other accommodations.",October 2019,NA

I did book direct with the hotel as I felt it was the best way to ensure the correct room type. While I benefited from the upgrade, my friend didn't as he had to sleep on a sofa bed instead of the double he should have had. The staff were friendly at all times.

I waited for 40 minutes in their lobby lounge (fell asleep) until they sent me a text message that the room is ready. During our 1st night the air conditioning in our room was not working properly so we asked if we could changed room but it was fully booked. So early morning the next day, a technician came to our room and had it fixed. The buffet breakfast at Puso restaurant is great. Their swimming pool is clean and always crowded.

If you want to be adventurous, you may take the jeep at the terminal station right across the hotel.  These jeeps can bring you outside the main city of Cebu.  The hotel room is decent but my bad experience during my last stay was the bathroom floor was not so clean.

Three of my friends including myself are actually allergic to crabs and shrimps (and we were not able to bring antihistamine with us) but since we would really like to taste their very enticing seafood dishes, we decided to taste it despite the risk of having allergies. So far, all the dishes were actually worth the allergies! If you were there, I‚Äôm sure you also can‚Äôt resist to taste their delicious dishes. With their delicious foods and excellent service from the staff,  you can tell how much effort, commitment and passion their staff have put into it. Definitely a service from the heart!

Although this hotel rate is not very expensive, it offers a great experience. I have visited the Philippines seven times so far, but regret that I did not use this hotel until now.

It feels like that when the place first opened up it was a 4 or 5-star hotel however, over the years they have lost some of their old flares.  The staff is very friendly and aside from a minor booking issue that caused a slight headache, I cannot say very, as far as complaints.  The meals in the restaurant are expensive, though they do provide a very wide selection however, if you do not feel spending a large amount of money, ordering room service is cheaper and you will still receive a full plate of food.  You are a 5-minute walk to Ayala and a short ride to the business section.  The location is very good if you are looking for shopping at the malls are all within 15 mins of the hotel and you can still get outside the city fairly quickly if you want.

It was just too busy at the lobby and the check-out took sometime because there were only 3 front desk staff. Breakfast buffet is great! They have a lot of choices. It was a bit warm in the dining area though - a/c problem probably. Rooms were good size but you know it's old. Towels are due for changing - not so white but there was no foul smell or anything. Foul odor on the sink drain but you will only notice it when you're close like brushing your teeth or washing your face.  A/C had a bit of a noise - can be ignored as it wasnt that loud.

It was very much appreciated from a couple who had a long flight and was stuck in traffic for an hour. The restaurant inside the hotel was good and they had a large selection that can satisfy both locals and foreigners. The location was across Ayala. I had the impression that I can walk out the door and cross the street but that wasn't the case. You had to go one block down and turn to get to ayala mall which wasn't too bad but for somebody who isn't from Cebu.... crossing that intersection can be pretty dangerous. I hope they're able to figure out a way for people to get across the mall. The rooms were large and clean but you can tell they're outdated. There were scuff marks on the walls. The internet wasn't as strong from our floor. Aside from that, if I ever come back to Cebu - I will stay in this hotel again.",January 2019,NA

You could not even walk in the room with the rollaway bed. It was also challenging to get to our luggage or even get dressed. Bathroom was also small for 1 person. Checkin was easy and they had great customer service, but room was just to small to be really enjoyed. No robes or slippers were provided.

After my stay here, I stayed one night at Radisson Blu, which is a bigger and classier hotel, but breakfast buffet food-wise, Quest Hotel's is better. The bacon is waaay tastier (so much better), they have taho, champorado and some Cebu specialties. This hotel doesn't have carpet in their rooms but the food very well made up for it. And the beds are comfier. One complaint I have is that they don't have conditioners that's supposed to come with shampoos. Other than that, I recommend you stay at Quest.",August 2018,NA

Henrik P,Aug 2018,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice hotel but.........,"The hotel is in the middle of the city close to the port, which makes it a good location for an overnight or two or when you need to go with the ferry the day after arrival. The rooms are fine, clean and spacious. The restaurant is nice and serves nice western and Asian food both for dinner and breakfast. I use this hotel when travelling with my work in the Philippines which, up on till last stay, made it ideal. Over all a good hotel but ........If you travel and have a company booking watch out ! The following should be observed as the hotel, has no control over their money flow. My room was booked by my company, who made the bank transfer for the payment in advance, long story short..... they (the hotel) have now taken the money from the bank transfer and the payment I was forced to do via credit card, due to the hotels problems in handling company payments. Thus said, am I sad to say that a good hotel became poor, and have lost potential business customers, so watch out !",August 2018,NA

The Quest Hotel did not disappoint.  The location of the property is excellent.  It is directly across the street from the Ayala Mall.  Philippine malls are much better than American malls.  They have real restaurants and not just junk food available.  They are also a social meeting place for the community where malls in America are dying.  Besides the mall, the nightlife is excellent and close to Mango Square where I partied at a disco.  I also enjoyed lounging at the pool and ordering mango shakes from the poolside bar. The staff were very helpful to me when I was planning my trip to Oslob to swim with the whale sharks.  I decided to bypass the bus and go with a private driver.  It saved me time and I got to Oslob at 9am.  It was a beautiful sunny day and I saw ten whale sharks feeding in the cove area.  It was one of the highlights of my trip.  I highly recommend taking the 2.5 hour journey from Cebu City to Oslob to see these docile creatures.

Rooms were quite small by it's price standards, comparing to other cheaper hotels in the area which have bigger spaces.Bed was small and windows are not even floor to ceiling.  When we left around 7:30 am the next day, saw a very long queue to the breakfast buffet, felt relieved that we did not avail of the breakfast because of that queue.  I just don't get what sets is apart from the other nearby hotels which are Mandarin and Park Lane.

Randy,May 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent... Wonderful !,"My first time staying at this Hotel. I want to tell everyone I always stay at Parkland International Hotel across the street from Quest Hotel. My last stay at Parkland was Uncomfortable, and I decided to try Quest. This hotel is a complete upgrade compared to Parkland. I made reservations for the upgraded room with the balcony. Although it would of been better if the railings on the balcony and not cement, having to look over the cement railing to see downwards, it was nice eating on the balcony. The Pool area is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Pool side bar and actual tables for ordering and eating. During the day the pool can get a little crazy with the children, but at night with the poolside lights it is VERY nice and much calmer. The food at the breakfast is above average, but not great. I did not try the dinner buffet. All prices at any hotel in Cebu for food or drinks are going to be more expensive, but they seemed not as high as Parkland. Ayala is right across 2 streets, (be careful crossing, lots of undisciplined Philippine Drivers, but they can be very courteous if you show a little respect, don't run across the street). Ayala or any mall have lots of foods and restaurant choices. Staff here are very nice and courteous, they are careful with security, which makes me feel better and not a hassle. I only had 2 problems which was immediately fixed and corrected within 10 minutes. One by a manager and one by a engineer. I will come back here, and thank you for a wonderful vacation in the Philippines from an American.",April 2018,NA

All areas are clean and the rooms are fairly modern.  We opted for a premiere deluxe room with a terrace both times, I‚Äôd recommend asking for a pool view as the other side is just buildings.  On our last stay we arrived at least 6 hours before check in opened due to an early flight.  This was the day of Sinulog so the hotel was fully booked but we didn‚Äôt have to wait long for our room to be ready which was great and we wasn‚Äôt charged any extra with also a late check out request.  The only downside was breakfast time because we was early we opted to pay for breakfast which was 550 pesos, we felt like we was rushed we‚Äôd only just put our forks down and the bill was put on the table and our table was wanted.  I may have wanted to have something else from the buffet so I don‚Äôt think 550 pesos was worth it.  The WiFi in the hotel is ok too.  In all the hotel was a comfortable stay with added activities of a pool and gym.  If I was to come to Cebu city again I would probably choose to stay here again.",January 2018,NA

This time we were very impressed with the positive changes made in the restaurant both in term of food quality and attentive service.  The hotel was 98% full while we there and it does appear that its clients are increasingly more Asian.  I would urge management not to forget the tastes of Westerners: we do not want to eat rice with every meal and some potatoe dishes should always be available. Also, replenishment of dishes as they are consumed should continue up to closure.  For example, there was no bacon at breakfast after 9.30am, and all the bread and butter had also been consumed.

fanseafan,Sep 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good but could be better,"All hotel staff try to make your stay pleasant, but they could be more efficient, especially for group check-in. We were a group of 15 and it took more than 30 minutes! at the check-in counter. Slow check-in is a chronic problem in Philippine hotels. Arriving late at night and tired from a long flight, a quick shower and comfortable bed is most welcome - FAST!  I told the lady staff that I will time how long she could complete our check-in. I have sent our names, gender beforehand, so rooms could be reserved by the time we arrived. Checking our reservation and copying of passports should be the only time-consuming factor, and if 2 staff are doing this - I really cannot understand why it is taking more than 30 minutes - EVERYTIME! If Quest can do group check-in for a max of 10 minutes next time, I will be very much IMPRESSED. Another area for improvement is the breakfast menu. I wanted to drink milk and poured one, but found the taste strange - it was soya milk. I told the staff and they put the right label. Small detail, but the mistake could have serious consequence for someone with soya allergy. Staff should check  that food labels, names are placed correctly.",September 2017,NA

Around 3 PM, I went down to get the room key but unfortunately to my surprise, it wasn't still available and I was made to wait for another 20 to 30 minutes.  No welcome drinks being offered to us while other got theirs which to us is very discriminating. Some got theirs while they were in queue checking in but we were just passed by.

Breakfast generally always fails for foreigners in hotels in Cebu especially but not here in Quest. The choice is never ending and the dishes are topped up at a rate I've never seen before. Congratulations to the FB Manager as well as the General Manager and owners.  The room I am staying in is a Deluxe, could be better for the money but when one considers the breakfast the over all value for money is there.

andrewhT2723MP,Jul 2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,An average hotel needing improvement,"This hotel is an average to good hotel  but with some areas which could be much improved. I stayed in an executive suite. The rooms were a good size with an average level of fixtures and fittings. The real below average aspects are the bathroom linens: no hand towels and bath towels which are small and thin. And poor bathrobes. In addition, in the suite those designing the bathroom managed not to install  flexible shower  tubes either in the bath or in the shower!  The other far below average aspect is the breakfast experience: it is like being in a school canteen with tables one upon the other, lousy coffee (you can get a capuccino or expresso, but you are charged for them ), normally NO vegetables, so vegetarians like me beware, and no egg holders for those having soft boiled eggs! In addition, the croissant are laced with cinnamon which I hate. You just want to get in and out of there as quickly as possibel! Last but not least, the rooms are poorly insulated one from another. My rooms had rugs on the floor which had hair allover them. There was hair in the bathroom. I asked housekeeping to clean them better and was asked ""oh you want me to vacumn clean the room?' , so I understood that was not part of every cleaning of the room! Wifi is average.",June 2017,NA

The staff in the reception area, however are not that sharp in taking down details, even when previous reservations and arrangements have already been made the day before. They are not that warm in accommodating their local guests, but did a gaga over foreigners! The staff in the buffet area were the friendly and responsive ones, though. The security guard assisting the customers in flagging a taxi was a snob and would tend to reprimand its guests just because his question was not answered right away (He was asking us if we are to take a taxi but we were not able to readily respond because we were actually just deciding if we are to book for a Grab taxi or just take a walk first).",June 2017,NA

My friend told me that this hotel has a good location and will be convenient for me since it's my first time to visit the city. Taxi drivers knew the hotel and just like 30min drive  from the airport. The lobby has a business-like atmosphere but nonetheless, friendly. The room is spacious even for 3 people (I traveled with my mom and dad). They have proper amenities and facilities that is much better that some 4-star hotels I've seen and been to. Great selection and delicious food in their buffet. The breakfast is really something, I love it. The staff are also friendly. The concierge team were really helpful, considering I was doing a very late city tour reservation. If you are new in the city, I recommend you to do this. They have options to choose from. Lastly and true to the word, it really has a good location. Ayala Mall is just across the road, so you have a lot of options should you prefer to eat outside the hotel. I do recommend this hotel.*Side note, our bathroom sink had a small problem of draining water. I had to raise this concern to the FO which I guess they fixed when we went back to the room.",May 2017,NA

So choosing the right and best hotel was difficult considering Cebu has a number of hotels all over the city. I read numerous blogs and reviews which lead me to booking Quest Hotel. I stayed with my daughter and nephew for 3days and for them it was the grandest of all hotel staycations they had. The hotel staff were all very hospitable and friendly especially the chinita receptionist and the housekeepers and floor supervisor on the 15th floor. Always has a chance to greet chat smile or say bye. Room was great, very clean. Not even a strand of hair in sight. Bed was comfortable. Cant hear noise from hallways nor outside the hotel. Breakfast was superb! Wide array of foods to choose from and delight. There was also a taho vendor going around. Pool was small but still my daughter enjoyed the cool water. Wifi VERY GOOD!!! I must say that staying at Quest Cebu has made me decide to come to Cebu more often and make Quest my almost 2nd home. My tito and tita from NYC just booked their hotel stay on the 3rd week of June.

Yes they have a huge buffet breakfast selection but food is just so terrible. Dining surrounding is so dirty. Floors are wet and food pieces are all over the floor. Breads are tough, seemed it has been there for weeks already. Condiments are wrongly labelled (sesame oil was labelled as fish sauce!!!) and the attendant will even argue with you insisting it was correct.

And so I brought swimwears for the whole family which took quite a space in our luggage only to find out only upon checking in that their pool is under renovation and could not be used until its done by March 31. Imagine our frustration. I've been calling this hotel prior to our stay to inquire about payment, parking,  etc but I was never told that thier pool is under renovation.  It would have been ok if our room had a bathtub wherein my kids could use instead but ours had none. Our reservation was for 2 days but since the pool was unavailable I decided to cancel the one day and transferred to another. Reservation should inform inquiring guest if pool is available or not.After checking in, we were brought to our room. What struck me most in this hotel was that our room smelled very good and clean.

Wish they had told us the pool was being reno'd, and that they had gotten us pool privileges at a nearby hotel, but central location in Cebu Business Park can't be beat. Watch your access points to Ayala, though. Under the flyover is a little sketchy, but going the long way down the road, gives you a crosswalk and direct entry to Metro, if you need it.

Bernardeck,Mar 2017,2.0 of 5 bubbles,No smoking policy,"I have booked Quest Hotel for my my 3 nights stay from March 10 -13. Prior to my online booking, i have wrote in to the hotel to check on the late check out policy as my flight back was in the evening. I have also asked if the hotel have a smoking room. The hotel replied with regards to the rates for the late check out but nothing on the smoking rule. I went ahead to book the 1 room. Upon arrival, the hotel told me that the check in time is at 3pm, and the check out time is at 12pm. There will be a charge of 500 peso per hour for any late late check out. And i was always told that all the rooms there are non smoking, if i do need to smoke, i will have to go down to the outside of the hotel to do it. On the first night, i went ahead to smoke in the room, and on the next day, after my room was being made up, i was serve a notice that i have been fined 6000 peso for it. On the day of my check out, i was asked to pay 2000 peso for the late check out which i have no issue with, but the hotel insist that i will have to pay the additional 6000 peso for the penalty. I counter that i was not told that there will be a 6000 peso penalty imposed. The hotel stand was that they will not be able to sell the room out with the cigarette smell in the room from the first night. I then suggested that perhaps it will be cheaper if i were to book another room online for the same day to settle the issue which only cost me less than 3000 peso to do so. The hotel agreed, and the matter was settled. For all those who needs to smoke, i STRONGLY urge u to look for other alternatives accomadation. I use to stay at Mandarin Plaza just next to Quest, unfortunately it was fully booked for the period that i was there. The rooms are much bigger, check in and check out times are more flexible and they do have smoking rooms there. And the rates are definitely better than Quest ! So smokers beware !!",March 2017,NA

At 2.00pm we were told room still not ready, I asked if we could be told when room ready and we took a seat in reception area.  At 2.50pm we asked a different receptionist if room ready and were told it was, why had the initial receptionist not told us?I felt the initial receptionist, who considered smiling inanely to represent good customer service, had no intention of providing any sort of service.

Since we got in so late, the hotel also granted us a late check out which was appreciated.  We also enjoyed the breakfast buffet which was tasty.

Theresa H,Feb 2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,American's Review of Quest Cebu,"The price was very good compared to U.S. Hotels.  It was about $90/night (includes taxes).  It is located right across from one of the malls so whether you wanted food, entertainment or money exchange, it was all there.  We arrived on the last day of Sinulog.  The hotel and staff were all very festive and made you feel a part of the festival even if you didn't attend official festivities.  The hotel was about 35 minutes from the airport but very close to everything else.  We always either took a taxi or hired a driver.  You wouldn't want to drive in the Philippines; much more chaotic than most U.S. cities.  We had the luxury of travelling with friends from the Philippines so language wasn't too much of a problem and most everyone speaks English along with most signs being in English also.  For the most part service at the hotel was very good with a few exceptions at the restaurant.  Food and beverage was pretty good.  They have a nice buffet but we were too full to ever eat an entire meal.  The ala carte variety option was just ok (food good) because after staying for 4 nights you get a little tired of eating the same things.  That is why having the mall across the street was a good option.  The wireless connection in the entire hotel was very good.  The pool was on the small size but it wasn't crowded.  They do have some nice cabanas with chair pads that are very nice and there is no extra charge.  There is also a swim up bar.  Rooms were large and clean and they provide complimentary bottled water.  They had all the amenities of a US hotel.  Only issue we had in the room was the water was what I consider only warm but our friends didn't have an issue with their room.  The hotel sent someone up a couple of times but could never find an issue with it.  I guess we are just used to hotter water.  It's one way to not stay in the shower too long.  No need to pay extra for a view as there really isn't one worth looking at.One thing to look out for when booking a hotel stay is to make sure you know what date it will be in the Philippines when you arrive to your hotel to check in.  There was a hotel guest checking in while we were checking out (suggest settling your hotel bill the night before because all hotels seem to take awhile to check out. This hotel does accept credit cards).  Unfortunately, when he booked the room he didn't realize the date/time change and his room stay didn't start until the following day and they were fully booked.",January 2017,NA

Nurse Darrell went to the room to check on my mom and went to the hospital with us. Nurse Darrell even stayed until we were able to get a room in Perpertual Succour Hospital. Apparently, my mother had ulcers and needed blood transfusion as her hemoglobin count dropped to 5 (normal was at least 12).

They asked me if I had any plans and I responded ""no"". they said that they would love to set up a reserved table that evening for the 2 of us so we could have dinner with the restaurant. I asked if they would make a cake for her also. That evening as we arrived we were taken to the reserved table with fresh cut roses in the center. After we  finished eating the chef brought the cake to our table with some of the kitchen, waiters and other staff members to sing a ""Happy Birthday"" song to my fiance.

Angelescitypi,Sep 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very nice and safe corner near Ayala Mall,"First time staying in the Ayala Hotel CornerI must say as a relatively regular traveler to The Philippines and Cebu this is my first time staying at this hotel and I was impressed. They appear to run a first class hotel operation here and I although unaccustomed to walking through a metal detector at temporary lodging facilities soon adjusted. I was impressed by the line up of door personnel to include bellboys and security personnel. I was impressed with their seemingly heartfelt greetings particularly the gesture of their hands above their hearts. The security personnel were courteous and thorough in the assurance of our safety as guests whenever we departed the hotel. The often would signal a taxi from the queue , getting our room number, destination for their log as well as providing us with the taxi identifying info (which was also annotated in their log). This made me feel safe as at the very least all of this information would be available in the event of any untoward incident.The front desk personnel were professional, friendly and immaculate in appearance. They ensured that I was welcomed as they very quickly became familiar with my name and room number. It was always a joy dealing with them. the pool staff were cordial and professional. My housekeeping room attendant was friendly and accommodating. The dining room staff were top notch with delightful culinary masterpieces created and artfully displayed daily. The room was clean, comfortable, serviceable and tastefully decorated. tHe complimentary bottled water left daily was greatly appreciated particularly after a hot day traversing the city. tHe only con I could mention was the inconvenience in not having smoking rooms. The two choices we smokers had was to go to the 7th floor pool area (not accessible 24 hours) or to stand out on the street by the curb. Other than that I truly enjoyed my stay. being able to walk to Ayala Mall/The Terraces was priceless. Would I stay here again? Probably.....",September 2016,NA

It is certainly not a Sheraton or Marriott, but the prices are also much lower than those properties.  There is one restaurant in the hotel, that has both a buffet and an ala carte menu.  The quality of the food at the buffet was average.  I ended up eating breakfast there each day, but went to other restaurants in the Ayala Center mall next door for more upscale food.  I was very surprised that the hotel does not provide the guests with hand lotion.  That was the first hotel I stayed at in my life that did not include that, but otherwise the supplied amenities were fine.",September 2016,NA

Notable also are their many elevators that worked well - no need to wait long to get a ride. Thumbs up that I was able to check-in at 1:30 pm when check-in time was at 3:00 pm (1 hour later than the typical 2:00 pm check-in of most hotels).

Aveeno1991,Sep 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,More cons than pros....,"We took advantage of the long weekend and went to Cebu for some rest and relaxation. Our flight arrived late at night and found ourselves checking in at around 10pm. First, our request to have queen sized beds in the 2 rooms we booked weren't accommodated. The FO staff simply said they ran out. Funny because checking-in the same time as we did were a group of foreigners (two of whom were holding/drinking beer from a bottle) who were given queen sized beds after their inquiry. So imagine my 6'2 frame squeezed into a narrow single bed....for 3 nights. The hallway was dark and so was the room. I had to open all three lampshades inside just so I could see my way around. The bathroom was clean with the basic amenities: toothbrush and shampoo. The water was of the hard variety, though. The type you have difficulty rinsing off the soap suds you lathered all over your body. The soap was a different story altogether - it did not lather. I had to buy my own to give myself a good wash. Service was spotty, too. Commendation should be given to the security team manning the main entrance. They were warm and courteous. I appreciate the hand in heart greeting - if only it was consistently practiced. The members of the concierge team never accorded the same greeting despite my lingering presence at their station poring over the tours they offer - and I was always there walking around while waiting for my friends to come down. I guess they have yet to institutionalize this to make this a part of everything they do. Last thing: a big poster in the lobby gives directions as to where to properly cross the street to Ayala Mall. It directs all guests to make a right and walk several hundred meters to Red Planet from where one may cross. We found that by turning LEFT, another pedestrian lane exists via a much shorter route.",September 2016,NA

I always thought a hotel would have a check-out time policy.  In fairness, the hotel provided us with a temporary room for us to wash up and change in time to attend a welcome dinner.  And a hotel staff did call me at around 7 pm to inform me that the 2 rooms were finally available.Upon checking in to our rooms at around 11 pm, I noticed that the room I occupied with my son had a faint rancid smell.

The breakfast buffet used to being a highlight but now appears to have been scaled back to a true three star offering. The only realy edible option is the fresh egg station, the restaurant is tightly packed, noisy and chaotic, the extremely friendly servers are rushed to the point where they find top ups and table clearance almost impossible - It appears that the regular staff are assisted by casuals for this but whilst friendly they are largely clueless. As said, the highlight Is the staff, from restaurant to housekeeping, they are friendly, courteous and a credit to the hotel, with the amusing exception of a guy in a suit we nicknamed ""Radio"" who we frequently saw marching around the outlets and lobby looking very important ignoring guests with his Walkie talkie permanently grasped in his hand as a symbol of his authority.Special thanks to the Puso breakfast team for their warmth and for trying to give us personalized service under strained conditions.

The location was great. The staff were accommodating and promptly did when asked for some service like cleaning our room. The only thing that was less favorable was the variety of fish on the menu. It would have been great if a variety of local catch within the province or region are served instead of one particular fish which is served in most menus. Otherwise, for those who are not particular with seafood, the rest of the menu were nice. Thank You.",July 2016,NA

I can easily compare the buffet breakfast that  my family experienced at Alpa Suites, it wasn't as tasty even if Puso had more options. Being an affiliate with Crimson Resort Hotel, food should be at par with the said hotel as I'd think it should.",June 2016,NA

Basic amenities are provided: WIFI, ref, minibar, coffee/tea service, slippers, towels, blowdryer and newspaper. What I like about this hotel is the food. They have a good spread for the buffet. You can also have your complimentary breakfast as lunch or dinner for an additional fee (P125). Just don't order any of the dessert because they are not worth the money.",July 2016,NA

William Alexand... B,Jul 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,reasonably priced hotel and centrally located.,"I was picked up at the airport by a polite and pleasant driver and my checkin at the hotel counter was smooth and flawless. I have stayed in this hotel several times before and I can definitively say that the staff here are wonderful people. Once in a while there are small hiccups that derail the otherwise peaceful stay. For example in my last stay I had to report two Indians or Middle eastern men arguing in their room and getting very loud. I called the operator and said they were sending security up. It took 3 calls to security before they finally went up and even then they did nothing until the night manager got there. I think this is an unsafe behaviour on the part of the security because had that been a life threatening situation people would have been injured or dead before they arrived to do anything. On the bright side the rooms are clean, well stocked, and comfortable. The rooms have nice thick blackout curtains for the late risers like me who don't want to be bothered by glints of the morning sun. The bathrooms were equally clean and well stocked and had the all important bidet. The buffet has shrunk in size compared to my first visit here last year. On this last stay they had a Mexican themed buffet over the weekend and I was quite pleased with the lamb leg on the roast counter. The staff at the push restaurant are phenomenally nice and they remembered my name and how i want my coffee even though it has been a few months since my last visit. The essential Wifi is complementary and adequately fast although it slows down early evening I suppose when everyone has returned to the hotel. The hotel is a short walk to the Ayala mall where one can try various restaurants and shopping. The hotel always has a queue of taxi's waiting so a ride is never a problem. Quest is also centrally located so I get to do my business and have some fun within a certain radius from the hotel. This central location is important because Cebu can have atrocious traffic conditions especially during rush hour and payday weekends. The Hotel also has a lovely roof deck pool where one can relax after a long days work and they have in room massage services. The price of the hotel is reasonable and perfect for the budget conscious on long business trips.",July 2016,NA

It was a decent hotel but there is no smoking in the rooms at all with no balconies so I had to go outside. I'm OK with that but it should say that specifically.

The service is consistently good, and the staff are always very pleasant and ready to serve in any way they can. The property is conveniently opposite the Ayala Mall with its great shops and restaurants. Getting across the busy street from the hotel can be quite a challenge, however, and the hotel may want to see how they can assist guests - it is a dangerous crossing! The rooms are well-appointed and very comfortable, with hi-speed internet and prompt room service. Management need to look at maintaining the property adequately, however: there are visible cracks in the flooring of the elevator, for example, something you don not expect to see in a hotel of this quality. Also, although the restaurant offers a very capacious buffet, the a la carte menu is quite limited. Many guests, I feel, do not have huge appetites and would like more choices instead of the buffet. Overall, however, the Quest is well recommended.",June 2016,NA

We received a room with a balcony, which was poorly maintained and outdated, so we did not use it. There was no crib for the baby, my wife eventually proposed getting a twin mattress which we miraculously fit inside the room and were able to enclose for the baby to sleep in. The hotel is close to a shopping mall, access by foot is very possible, but tricky as traffic is not always cooperating. I used the fitness center, which was ok for a quick workout on the treadmill and some weights, access was weird, as you have to go through the parking garage, which is not air conditioned and felt like a sauna (this was in early-mid June).

Wifi is fast and the buffet breakfast is sumptuous and lots to choose from. But the ala carte is also good, especially the Luxury Cheesecake, one of the best I've tasted and the lechon (roast pig) every Sunday lunch is a must! Pair it with the flavored puso and you got a certified Cebuano meal.One thing, location is central and just right across a major mall and has ready access to public transport.

The staff perform their duties to an acceptable standard, but that's all. The rooms are a little dated and the walls appear to be paper thin. My peace was constantly disturbed by loud Filipino guests in adjoining rooms, speaking loudly in Tagalog, slamming doors and generally showing no respect for other guests. I called reception twice about the noise and although the lady receptionist assured me she would send security, I saw no evidence of it. There are not enough elevators for the number of rooms and long delays for an elevator are common. On the plus side....the bed was very comfortable.",June 2016,NA

aggomez101,Jun 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Average hotel,"I've been choosing Quest as a priority hotel everytime I get an assignment in Cebu.  I notice that their service has deteriorated - room, amenities, food, service.  Room is very dim. As a business traveler, I also need to work in my room at night. Hence, they should provide an option for white or brighter light inside the room.  Management has to replace their towels already as these look old and greyish white.  I also have to request for face towel everyday of my stay as they don't replenish it every time I request for room make up.  Food at the restaurant is not that good anymore and variety is not as wide, especially at breakfast. Fortunately, staff at the restaurant are very nice and friendly.  My other consolation in this hotel is the fast internet and it is within walking distance from Ayala mall.",April 2016,NA

They placed us in a room with construction going on above us.  The room itself appeared clean but there were small roaches in the bathroom and drawers.  The pool was under construction and though the front desk said we could sit outside, the doors were padlocked and trash blocked the door.  The room service food was below average considering the cost.  The shower  eventually would go from cold to luke warm, and the sink for the drain was clogged.

Though my last stay here (3 May 2016) was not good because of the accident I had in their resto (the chair tilted and collapsed while I'm sitting - despite me being light weight and this is a sign of lack of inspection in the area in terms of safety for their guest),May 2016,NA

Jun L,May 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My Quest Experience!,"I already had a bad experience with this hotel when Quest opened its doors a  few years ago.  This  is my second stay.  Availing the Quest lifestyle Booklet Gift certificate in a deluxe room with breakfast buffet.  Check in by friendly front office staff,  Katch was swift  I was upgraded to room 752 with balcony.  I met security officer Ana at the 7th floor who personally accompanied me to my assigned room.    It has a clean  small bathroom with fresh  new towels.   Room has a single queen sized bed..Strong wifi connection.  I also enjoyed the relaxing  infinity pool.  Fresh towels were given by friendly pool attendant.  Breakfast  lunch at Puso was great. I was amazed with the taho station during breakfast. Lechon  sashimi  at lunch aside from the variety of food choices  I was assisted to my table  offered coffee by Janesen .  Even she was very busy attending to other guests.  Restaurant staff are very attentive .  Minor issues like dusty headboard, duvet  pillows looks tired,  unpleasant smell at the hallway going to my room and front office staff needs more training in customer service. Especially  to Kristine  Pearl.  As they insisted that only 2 bottles  of water are complimentary.  Once you consume that,  it is available for sale at 25 per 325ml bottle. Complimentary bottled water is supposed to be FREE  unlimited in hotels of this category. But both Pearl  Kristine are very enterprising in selling complimentary bottled water to hotel guests.  When I insisted , Pearl even offered to send me a pitcher of water which I refused to accept.  Unfriendly  unaccommodating front office personnel  Pearl  Kristine are like MONSTERS wearing a PLASTIC SMILE in the front office.   Special mention to Marianne , as she was the person who resolved the complimentary water issue  even sent me a complimentary cake.  I also had a conversation with duty manager Delsa after my breakfast  told her regarding the issue.  Aside from the complimentary bottled water that I received .  I also had a complimentary lunch buffet  late check out from her.  My overall stay was still fantastic even with the minor issues involved.  I would like to thank duty manager Delsa, front office staff Katch, Marianne,  Ana of security, Janesen  Johnsen of Puso , pool attendant  security staff at the entrance for their outstanding service during my stay.  They are very professional  dedicated with their respective jobs  Security personnel are friendlier than front office staff.  A great improvement compared to my previous stay aside from the excellent customer service.",May 2016,NA

Joseph B,May 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,In Quest for a Hotel ,"One of several hotels near Ayala Mall, it was highly recommended by friends who live in Cebu. However, my experience didn't meet the expectations they created. The rooms are small. We had a corner room, which is usually a plus, but in our room, the air conditioning unit was over the right side of the bed. Intermittently, condensation from the A/C would drip onto the bed. Slippers, listed as part of the amenities of the room, were not provided until we asked for them. We were told they are only provided on request. Even though the room was booked for two guests, only one toothbrush was provided, although when we asked for a second one, housekeeping did provide it. Upon check in, we were asked for a P1000, per day, deposit, so be prepared for this. The WiFi was excellent, but check out was very slow. Our friends had raved over the breakfast buffet, but it was underwhelming. I found the selection limited. I opted for the dinner buffet, one night, which was very good, much better than breakfast. Rates at the Quest tend to be a bit higher than at other hotels near Ayala. Frankly, I don't think it's worth more to stay there. The hotel is OK, but stumbles on many details.",May 2016,NA

Luis R,May 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent option for Cebu City,"Quest is a very well located hotel nearby Ayala Center in Cebu City (roughly 5 minutes away walking distance). Rooms are small but in pristine condition, the bed and the linen are perfect, and the aircon is generally very good.Breakfas buffet is outstanding, and the attention at the check-in and check-out process is fair enough. At this point, I have to add that customer attention in Cebu City is remarkably better than in Luzon, at least in my experience.The only objection I may have for Quest hotel is perhaps that the pool area lacks a bit of glam, but this is obviously not an entirely objective observation.Last but not least, the cost per night is not higher than 3,000php (57EUR, 60-62USD). Try to get a similar thing in Madrid, Barcelona or Rome (or Manila!) and you will understand why Quest is a very good choice.Read more",May 2016,NA

It's literally a stone's throw away from the Ayala Mall, although crossing directly from the hotel is not advisable as it is a busy road. It's better to take the pedestrian lane a few steps down the road from the hotel. We were upgraded to an Executive Suite from a Deluxe Room, which is highly appreciated. It was a nice touch by the hotel staff since they weren't able to check us in earlier during the day due to the unavailability of rooms. The property is not large by hotel standards, but the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff makes up for it. Our room was basic and quite sedated when it comes to the design aspect. By the way, I am currently checked in as I type this review, using the hotel's Wi-fi, so I have no gripes about their Internet service.

The wifi is free and very fast, the rooms are clean and comfortable - nice beds and pillows! Lots of TV choices (movies, news etc).  I didn't use the gym, but had a quick look (a couple of cardiovascular machines, including a cross-trainer - and some weights). The pool on the 7th floor seems to be well used and cleaned regularly. I particularly like the corner rooms (rooms ending in 00, eg 1800, 1100 etc) as you get picture windows on two sides - one with a view towards the sea and one towards the hills.

I5852LFrichardb,Apr 2016,1.0 of 5 bubbles,WHAT A FALL FROM GRACE,"I have given this property about 40 hotel room nights over about two and a half years. In the early days of my stays, mainly via Agoda, I gave them high praise pretty much across all disciplines; food, bedroom comfort and cleanliness as well as service. Then, about a year ago they lost their Fil-Chinese Chef around about the same time that bathrooms and, to a lesser extent, bedrooms started to lose their shine. From that moment on the food quality has been on an inexorable decline. I every aspect it is now of an extremely poor and disappointing standard. The breakfast lacks fresh fruit and variety, the girl making the omelette really has little idea of what she is doing, the entire fayre is filipino centric meaning there is either little taste, its mushy or it tastes of sugar. That might be fine for locals, although I doubt it given that the price of a room has slowly increased as everything else has clearly gone down. The bathrooms tend to smell of some sort of stale cabbage, that is how I would describe the aroma knowing full well it is something far worse. The check out line is enormous; possibly because people cannot wait to leave and then, when you advise someone you are going for lunch instead of waiting for 30 minutes you are asked to make a late check out fee for coming back past 2pm even after you have also called the front desk and the operator to ask; nobody picks up after 20 rings on several occasions. I suppose the 'icing on the cake' of insults was to be advised that 'the late check out charge would be waived on this occasion' as if the hotel is doing me a favour. Quite remarkable. So there you have it; gone from a good all rounder to useless for a not inconsiderable rate of over $100 US dollars. I would just add that these feelings have been coming from me; its not just once but this was by far the worst experience. I had already placed this hotel below my first choice in Cebu; preferring instead the reasonable Radisson Blu which, in fairness to Quest, also has pretty awful food. Perhaps its just a Cebu malaise. So when choosing your Cebu hotel I would strongly advise you avoid Quest a bit like the plague at least until they perhaps announce to the world they have a decent Chef, some of the check in/out staff act with a little more intelligence and the bathrooms don't smell like a treatment works. Good luck fellow travellers.",April 2016,NA

Overall, an okay hotel except on a couple of accounts.The room that we got (we only booked one) was a connecting room so there was an extra door in our room. Thankfully, nobody stayed on the other side because the door seemed a bit flimsy and not sound proof. They can also improve on their coordination. We specifically requested for our room to be cleaned later in the day as we just got in late at night and did not have time to unpack before heading out for the hotel breakfast. We had some valuables exposed on top of the bed, even our cash. When we got back to the room after eating, we were surprised that a maintenance person was inside cleaning up. It did not seem we lost anything but because we did not know how much we really had during that time - we can never tell for sure.",May 2015,NA

We were always helped with our bags and they brought them to the room shortly after we got there. There is security at the entrance at all times, the lobby is nice, and the room was even better. I would put this hotel on par with Marriot. They even have a nurse on staff, which I didn't know until I called the operator for ER information and she said a nurse can come to our room. We only paid for the meds (70php) and my boyfriend felt better. Our room was on a corner so we had two amazing views of Cebu City, especially at night. There is the Ayala Mall right across the street and a restaurant inside the hotel. They have all the amenities in the room that you would expect - TV, hair dryer, room phone, safe, etc. No microwave. I haven't even seen a microwave anywhere in the Philippines during my stay. I find a lot of Filipino hotels do not have amenities Americans are used to. Foreigners have a lot of expectations for hotels, but this is the Philippines.

Jim F,Feb 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent first stop in the Philippines,"After two stays here at Quest Hotel, it occurs to me that this is maybe the ideal first stop for a 1st time traveler to the Philippines. Avoid the mess in Manila and fly in to Cebu Mactan International Airport. A cab ride of about 200 pesos ($4 USD) make sure they use the meter and take the white taxis, and you are here. Very much an American style hotel, this would be a 4 star in any American city. The size of the rooms is a bit small, but that is not a big deal. The amenities, location, and convenience to shops and restaurants and services is excellent. Right across the (very busy) road is Ayala Center, a mammoth mall complex, with outdoor terraces that have many restaurants. Starbucks and SBC coffee, TGI Fridays and Krispy Kreme are American brands here, but skip those and go local. Bo's coffee, J.Co donuts,and several burger places are better choices imo. But back to the hotel, free wifi in all areas, a 7th floor pool is decent sized, and the restaurant downstairs has a buffet that is so-so at best. But the staff are professional throughout the hotel, and everything seems clean and tidy. Very few negatives, all inconsequential , really. Great hotel, comfy beds. Water pressure and elevator arrival is better on lower floors.

The hallway smells of damp carpet but good thing the room smells good.  Checking in is slow as they often have only 1 or 2 front office assistants to attend to a long line of guests.

I'd like to say that they have a Great selection of Buffet from main course to dessert. Since we're In-house guest we only pay 499/head for dinner, the regular price is 699.  The varieties of food was palatable  the taste was really good.  The waiter was attentive to your needs. They also have complimentary CAKE for birthday guest. When it comes to room quality(deluxe king corner room) it was not big, it's just clean  simple. The bathroom was a bit small  it only has 1 light bulb for the entire room.

errym2016,Jan 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,very nice hotel,"Not sure if the room's rate a little high during the recent festival (sinulog) but even so i think the price just right for what they offered.Getting around from this hotel is quite easy, (as my main purpose to Cebu is to watch the Sinulog festival up close), the grand parade area is walking distance from this hotel. Transportation easy to find here, thanks to the hotel location just next to Ayala mall. Good location and pretty safe too.View from 17th floor is nice(my room facing toward the hill side). Window's glass is reasonably clean too, you should able to take nice picture :) i spent most of my time outside, so i can't write about the pool or restaurant/bar. If you not that demanding the gym should fine. There's 4 elevator (i think :O ) available at a time, so shouldn't wait for too long too or at least in my experience(not need room card too to access which easy). Wifi signal is superb during my stay,either at my room or lobby, or even when i'm outside to Ayala mall(before i enter the mall of course) and it hassle free to connect, speed are okay.  So overall i'm happy with my 3 nights stay. i have no complain,room are clean as well as the bathroom,nice and friendly staffs, maybe if i'm being picky i will think of the foods and drink price of mini bar at the room. i can understand it higher than outside, but i just think it just too high, for example a bottle of drinking water 1.5 L cost 245 PHP (if i not mistaken) but then again i'm not regularly check in to hotel, so i can't compare if it reasonable for the price they charge or it just expensive for the brand. This keep me from buy things from mini bar. Anyway, i recommend this hotel to everyone.",January 2016,NA

The room was too small for guest who had just arrive from travel somewhere. I bet this can only cater for backpack travelers. The lane heading to the car park was a bit small, i bet the hotel was built on a small space and was adjusted in accordance to its maximum length. The pool was favorably set on the 7th floor though it was nice, however i think the tiles or its floor was not properly leveled since water are filling like spots on different areas which can be slippery if kids run around. Maybe the pool area cant accommodate 20 guest as it will already be too crowded due to its small space. I have a friend who preferred it here but i must say its a little bit too pricey for what it could offer.

The airport pick-up and drop-off were very much on time (more timely than the Philippine Airlines flight) and the drivers were very courteous and helpful. The front desk staff personnel were efficient and courteous, not to mention were cute and  pretty. The food was great and was of varied selection that catered to different taste and preferences. The housekeeping staff were courteous and efficient. My personal guests who dropped by were treated well by the staff. The security guys were alert and respectful and whenever I took a cab from the hotel they made sure to tell the taxi driver to take me where I needed to go. The only hitch I had during my stay was when I asked where the duty free shop was and the front desk staff couldn't tell me where it was. She was cute so it was okay.

FrankieDP,Jan 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not Maintaining the High Standard Previously Set,"We live on Cebu island and visit the city regularly on business.  Previously, I have written highly about this hotel.  It is therefore sad to report that standards have not been maintained in recent months when I have visited on four occasions.  It is normally expected that requests on booking forms are noted and acted on if possible.  We found that the checking-in staff were unaware of what we had requested.  A waste of time then?On two occasions our rooms were so hot we could hardly breathe when we entered the room.  Housekeeping had left the curtains fully open and the sun had heated the room like a greenhouse.  Maximum use of the aircon led to a water leak all over an open  case, extremely annoying.  Only two coffee's  and two teas supplied, very meagre.  The sink plugs invariably do not work and the hot water could best be described as warm.  The biggest single deterioration is in the restaurant.  This used to be a highly favoured place for westerners as there were plenty of options in the buffet for international travellers. This is no longer the case.  After the buffet I went to Mc Donalds as I was hungry.  The menu now seems suitable only for oriental tastes.  The salad choice did not include potatoe salad, carrots, or boiled egg.  The buffet served lechon roast but virtually no vegetables or potatoes.  The beef stew was a tray of bones and gristle, really low quality beef.  The sweets were small slices of sponge cake, the fruits were low cost water melon and papaya, no pineapple, oranges, mango or apples.  No crepes like before. Clearly, the budget has been lowered for the buffet.  It was a Tuesday evening and I was told no juice to drink on a Tuesday, only on other days when the buffet price increased by 200peso.  As is so often the case in the Philippines, management is devoid of understanding what international travellers want.  We like hot food, not cold to warm.  We don't want rice and noodles, rice and noodles and more rice and noodles!  is not what we want.  Such a shame for a previously excellent hotel.",January 2016,NA

Tv with loads of channels (pretty crappy reception but ok), firm cozy bed, shower, no bathtub.On the 6th floor you find a small fitness centre. Dumbbells ranging from 5-25 kg, some machines for cardio and a multistation. On the 7th floor you find the pool.Breakfast buffet was amazing. Everything you might want for your morning meal..except maybe oatmeal. The staff is great. Almost to the point where it becomes ridiculous. We paid circa 80US$...which to me is a steal.Read more",January 2016,NA

Philippina,Dec 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Deal at US$64/ Night,"Cebu's Quest Hotel tags itself as a ""conference center"", and by that description, it does not disappoint. I booked a room at the 7th floor with a balcony (Note: All rooms are non-smoking rooms, but an ashtray is provided in the balcony). The room is barely 29 sqm but it comes with a mini-bar, complimentary tea/coffee, a comfortable king sized bed, average-sized TV (with limited cable channels), and toiletries (bath gel and shampoo/conditioner). Breakfast buffet for 2 is complimentary, and if you check-in early, the buffet is reasonably priced at US$11 (PH 500 net). The buffet includes a variety of cereals, fruits, a salad bar, cold cuts, and at least 4 dishes intended with fried rice. If the goal in Cebu is to shop/work and spend little time in the hotel just to sleep, then this hotel is for you. It is walking distance to the Ayala Mall and a short cab ride ($5) to Asiatown IT Park. There is a pool at the 7th floor, but the drains had a foul smell that turned me off (like stagnant canal water, mixed with chlorine).

Joeypac,Nov 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Ok but ended badly...,"It pays to check your (hotel) bill. Upon check out I found out that I was being charged PhP 526 for pressing. That was odd because I only had 2 shirts (shirt jack, short sleeves) pressed and I remember it was just PhP 70+ each. Seemed rather exorbitant. I asked the front desk staff why I was being charged such a steep amount for pressing of 2 items. After 15 minutes she got back to me and said because it was ""Express Service"". It wasn't. I asked that it be delivered the day after. And even if it was and the charge was double the amount, it won't be anywhere near the PhP 500 range. So she checked AGAIN and after 10 minutes she told me that Housekeeping made a mistake and thought it was for LAUNDRY and pressing. Hmmmm... sounds rather suspicious. They rectified the mistake and charged me the correct amount: PhP 200+ And oh- no apology. I had to ASK for it. Interesting enough, in my previous stay, I was not charged for a couple of room service meals and pressing. I called their attention to it and I was commended by the front office staff for my honesty and was informed that otherwise ""the staff will have to pay"" the amount.

Attentive-to-Details,Nov 2015,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Noise Becoming Intrusive,"The only question I asked before booking, was if it was possible to access the internet via ethernet in the room.  I was assured it was, so I pre-booked a non-refundable 6 nights.  Upon check-in I was informed that ethernet access was not possible in the rooms, only wi-fi.  I explained I am required to maintain security of the data being transmitted,  I do so at 3:30 AM local time, to have it received during business hours back home, I was advised I could use the business center, but at added cost.  Front desk personnel need to be better trained to know what they are talking about.  If you need ethernet access in your room, stay elsewhere. The added charge for including breakfast in the room rate isn‚Äôt justified by the caliber of fare in the breakfast buffet.  And, the hotel isn‚Äôt quiet, it is in between two constantly busy streets, with traffic which runs nearly round-the-clock, the single pane windows do little to block the noise (we were on the tenth floor and it was still intrusive).  I could have tolerated all of this, but on the third day of our stay, construction on what appeared to be an abandoned building began, at first during the day, but the next night it continued even at night, and appeared to be round-the-clock from that point on, with construction noises heard clearly in the room.  Judging by the state of the building being worked on, I am estimating that this construction will continue for a number of months.  I can only recommend those staying at Quest reserve a room on the side of the building facing the Mandarin Hotel to reduce as much traffic  construction noise as possible.  Even with ear plugs, at times the noise awakened us.On our last night, the room next door was occupied by several young people, that spent several hours moving from their room to others rooms, and talking loudly in the hallway, and slamming their doors because they couldn't be bothered to let it close quietly.  So, after 2+ hours of such activity, I notified the front desk and was told security would check the floor.  After another hour of such noise, I called the desk again, only to be told security had checked  found nothing wrong.  In light of staff‚Äôs apparent lack of interest in trying to provide for quiet in their hotel, I can only rate Quest at 2,  would recommend travelers try Harold‚Äôs Hotel, a short distance away, which is a little quieter, with better trained staff, better breakfast fare, ethernet  wi-fi in the rooms, better TV channel selection and lower rates for comparable rooms (including breakfast).  I am not affiliated with Harold‚Äôs Hotel, have stayed there several times,  feel it is the best mid-level hotel when compared to the Mandarin, and Quest Hotel.Read more",November 2015,NA

On our way out to dinner I notified the front desk and asked politely if someone could just give an extra sweep of the floor to get rid of the hair. When we got back hours later, nothing had been done. I asked again and they sent a young member of the cleaning staff to our room with only a dry towel...

Hiro6086,Nov 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Convenient and Clean,"I was in Cebu for a two-week business trip and stayed at Quest for the entire period. The mall is conveniently located opposite Ayala mall, which is pretty big. Apart from that, there is a 7-11 close by and some local eateries that opens late into the night. I also sent my laundry to a nearby launderette which was only 5 minutes walk. The staff are usually friendly and the reception was kind enough to accede to my request to change to another room of my choice. The room was clean and didn't look too old. But one can tell it was not a new hotel. The hotel comes with a gym and small pool but the opening hours are pretty early - 7am to 9pm. So it was quite a rush for me to get back to the hotel after work so I could hit the gym/pool. The breakfast spread wasn't that great despite the wide variety of choices. For example, the bacon was over-cooked and too stiff, making chewing tough. The wifi in the hotel was slow and it was practically impossible for me to update my applications on my phone. But I understand that the wifi in CEbu in general was slower so it was kind of expected. There was one night, though, that the cable TV went haywire, and it took one whole night before the channels came back on.

If, you are looking for good food, bright and cheerful rooms, and good housekeeping, look elsewhere. The buffet food was bland and ordinary. The hotel had a strange smell in the hallways and my room smelled like hard boiled eggs. After a long day out, expecting to come back to relax at 3 pm, I was surprised to see that my room still had not been made up. This was frustrating as I had to spend 40 minutes sitting in the lobby waiting. The hotel is also dark. Little natural light gets in, and the bathroom had no light in the shower-making it very dark. There are just three small lamps to light the room and a dull recessed light near the door. No one asked how my stay was upon checking out-they just wanted to know if I used any of the bar amenities to charge me. The best part of the hotel was the very friendly and helpful security guards out front.",October 2015,NA

I approached the front desk to request a room change. The receptionist said there was no other room available. Told her I will check out but she has to reverse my credit card charge. She refused and I was furious. I wasn't going to leave the front desk. She then asked a Housekeeping staff to check out my room. After checking, the housekeeping staff said, ""This room definitely stinks. You can't stay in this room."" He relayed this to the front desk. Only then was I given another room. I don't understand why some rooms in Quest stink and they have no quality control at all. Although I have already called the front desk staff's attention to the problem, they refused to fix it, something they owe their paying customers.

The area around the hotel seems safe; we walked around at night without incident. The rooms are nothing to write home about, but clean and comfortable. The breakfast was well worth the extra cash -- one of the best selections I've ever seen. If you want to spend some time at the beach, the day use package at their sister facility (Crimson) is a good deal. The beach area itself is so-so, but the pool area is nice, and the buffet lunch was pretty good. Also, the airport pickup service is very reasonably priced.",August 2015,NA

Yeah im with my fiance who happens to be a foreigner but that doesnt mean you will only accomodate him not me just because im a fil-chi. Please dont look down on people unless you know them,  im a college graduate and an mba postgraduate. Anyway,  all in all my stay there was good.  Im suggesting you would put some sports there aside from the pool like billards,  casinos, small shops because the only thing that they can do there is swimming,  nothing else.  Hotel was good.

I love how ayala mall is walking distance from the hotel. The buffet breakfast has greatly improved with more offerings including japanese fare and a huge assortment of breads. They also have a roaming taho man giving taho to anyone who wants some for breakast. The room is not as spacious as other hotels but if you're a business traveler you spend more time out anyway. The bathroom is a bit small for my taste but it has a heater so I'm fine. They provide your usual shampoo, bodywash, toothbrush and toothpaste, cottonbuds, shower cap. I like this hotel because it's clean and the buffet breakfast is good. The staff is great too! I enjoyed my stay! Would definitely want to stay here again if I'm in Cebu for a business trip. One qualm though is the bad wifi. I think this can be improved. It's been difficult to do work with intermittent wifi so I have to use my own internet. If you can improve this, that'd be stellar! I would suggest, get 1701 if you would like a room with a full window.... Other rooms only have your usual half windows.

It does get busy so if you want the cheaper room or a specific configuration (king bed, etc), book early.   The staff are pleasant and accommodating.  I recommend.

There is security, the facade of the hotel looks hip and new.  But then again after 3 days of stay we think that the room price is not worth it. The room did look clean when we enter it but then lo and behold at the window side this supposedly furnished wall well it wasn't. There was a door or a previously used cabinet door that was put there to cover a hole. You can hear the vehicles from below and where were we? At the 15th floor! Aside from the noise outside the hotel, we can also hear the noise at the hallway and the other rooms. TV reception was bad. Internet is slow. The next day I have a need to make some coffee to find those cups have stains in it!! Was it ever replaced or even washed?!! Even the glasses had hand prints and looked like they were already been used from the other day! Check out time is too early at 11am (in our opinion).

Just an hour before check out, a housekeeping staff came knocking on the door to check items from the mini bar asking us if we want to pay right away and if we are extending our stay?

Because of this attitude we found out about the Mandarin Plaza Hotel right next door. Beautiful place at least as good as the quest and they do care.

The people worked hard and treated me really well. They show that Filipinos can provide world-class service while remaining true to their culture of kindness and humility. What impressed me the most were the restaurant staff. Most diners don't realize the amount of effort that goes into feeding hundreds of people everyday, and a thousand things can go wrong. These guys make it seem effortless, and Ervic and everyone in the staff should be proud. This is not my go-to place to stay while visiting Cebu.",May 2015,NA

Quest is one of the largest hotels in Cebu City and can get quite busy at breakfast and at check in but the staff is fantastic at handling the guests.   The rooms are well appointed and the beds quite comfy.   Rooms are fairly quiet and I only had a really noisy neighbor once in my 3 previous stays.  I guess the only thing I can really nit pick about is the shower which has lousy water pressure.  The breakfast buffet is fantastic.   The pool while quite small is really nice and clean and good for a quick dip.  Location is on a busy road behind Ayala Terraces but once you are able to navigate across the street its an easy walk.

Johnell W,Jun 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Wow - NICE Hotel!,"We had 6 nights here in May 1015 - and HIGHLY recommend it to all travellers!  We spent a little extra for a Premium Room (it has a balcony), and were very impressed - it felt like a 5-start Hotel from the moment we walked into the Lobby to the moment we left - a very positive hotel stay experience!  Located directly opposite the Ayala Centre it was the perfect place to visit everything the city has to offer.  We'd previously spent 5 nights at the Wellcome Hotel just around the corner from the Quest which was very nice and clean and a pleasant, more 'homey' place to stay, but the Quest offers top-notch everything, from it's three breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets downstairs in the restaurant to the business centre, to the pool on the 7th floor and gym.  The two boys who serviced our 7th floor Premium Suite (Jake and Ulysees) were so lovely and always went the extra mile to be helpful - I'd love to adopt them and bring them home! The room service menu is to die for, even though there's more choice for restaurants in the area than you could try in a month!  I'd certainly recommend The Quest - Cebu to anyone who's looking for a 5-star experience and is on a budget .. it was worth every cent.  The Hotel's car is like a private limousine (I think it was Ph 800 for the one-way trip to the airport), and the driver was so sweet.  I wouldn't ever want to stay anywhere else in Cebu City now that I've experienced The Quest!",May 2015,NA

Also loved the convenience of the hotel's location. Hotel was clean, staff were pleasant and accommodating. Only downside to the hotel was the pool/smoking area hours. The pool/smoking area was only open till 9pm so u can't have a late dip or have drinks by the pool, which is too bad cuz they have a mini bar by the pool side. And if u wanna smoke after 9 pm then you'd have to go all the way down, outside of the hotel. I wish the pool was a little bigger and deeper too. Deepest part of the pool was only 4 ft deep. But overall, our stay was great. It met our needs for that leg of our trip.",June 2015,NA

Massage therapists, sensational.  I'm a hotel snob usually going only to 5 stars so I hold a pretty high standard and I was thrilled with this hotel.  I'm not saying everything was perfect; I would have loved a choice of pillows as the one they had was hard.  Finer sheets would have been spectacular.  Better quality food, but you're not paying $500 a night here either.  I recommend it as a great value hotel.",June 2015,NA

NO ICE MACHINE OR ICE BUCKET. You can get some ice but it is a real act to get. And they could charge you. There is no microwave in room either. There is no gym and some of the staff are clueless on some easy questions. But that is all the bad now the good Nice clean rooms Pay extra when booking for the breakfast it is the best you can get in a good 10 mile radius. It took me a little while to find it but they have a shuttle to and from sm mall and ayala Mall. Free of charge. Also they have a 24 hour nurse if you get sick. And the jewel of the hotel came down to 2 people (j-Lord) Jelord Recilla and Nestle Borromeo. First Miss Nestle a front desk Manager Really help with everything and working with us to handle our needs. If you have problems she is the one to talk to I know she will fix it or take care of it. And (J-lord) this young guy is perfect in rooming cleaning and will fix you room the way you want it and do it that way every time. He was the one that told us about the 24 hour nurse after our little girl got sick. He also told us all the nice place to eat. We got just him to clean our room and never had a problem. Over all great hotel just a few little problems. Oh ya One last thing to all my American travels if you like J-lord take care of him. And my last thing is the worst part of the hotel a big one to me but may very to you the Internet SUCKS its there and it is free but it is very slow and forget about downloading anything it is blocks you, can surf ONLY.

Plenty to choose from, from local food to Western.  We had the pleasure of being invited to to two evening buffets one mixed Asian and other being forced sea food. Both a memorable experience.  We must say a huge thank you to Joaquin who made or stay really comfortable this does not happen often in big hotels usually. We decided to go out of our way and treat some local children at an orphanage and the hotel hit a car ready for us.  They were very happy that we were doing such a nice deed they also helped us with transport. The swimming pool was good but we just had a little moan about smoking around the pool.

Virgilio Sison,Apr 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Hotel with the Cebuano hospitality,"I was able to book a weekend stay in this hotel simply because of the hefty discount I got. But the room rates are in fact four-star, meaning higher compared to those offered by the other nearby hotels. The best one I liked in the hotel is the Puso Bistro  Bar in the ground floor which serves all kinds of native and international picture-perfect and delicious food. A summer dip in the merely four-feet and narrow swimming pool in the seventh floor is a refreshing experience nevertheless. Unfortunately the room they gave me in the fifteeth floor exuded a foul odor, and the housekeeping staff said it was probably coming from the airconditioning unit, but they were quick to apologize and immediately transferred me to another room in the seventeenth floor which had a malfunctioning safety deposit box, but again, they were very quick to fix it, so my stay in the room had been generally relaxing. The deluxe room is well-designed and spacious, quite comfortable, with clear cable TV,  the bathroom is much okay for a hot shower with all the needed toiletries. But the wifi is very slow! There is complimentary mineral water, but the rest of the goods in the mini refrigerator are for sale. There are no slippers so you have to bring your own or order a pair, perhaps for a fee. A business center in the ground floor caters to all kinds of internet and printing needs, for a small fee of course. The staff are very courteous and hospitable, and you would really feel as an important guest. An added factor is the hotel's very close proximity to the Ayala Center Mall and other tourists spots in Cebu City As a whole, my stay in Quest Hotel has been quite satisfying. I would probably stay there again in my next trip to Cebu.",April 2015,NA

What really won my heart was the service the staff delivered consistently during our entire stay. Every personel took it personally to make our stay most comfortable and enjoyable. There's was a few issues with the aircon during our stay but was resolved almost immediately and even folllowed up to ensure there was no further issues. Also have to give a special thanks to security and management, we had left our go pro camera in the taxi and security and management did everything they could to recover the lost camera. Eventually through their persistance the camera was recovered a day later. We stayed in a room with a balcony overlooking a main street. Despite facing a main road, the noice and traffic was not bothersome. The beds are quite plush and comfortable and the buffet breakfast was full of choice.

In my room i had the router above my bed and the IT department came to my room twice and still couldn't get it to work and blamed it on the internet service provider. Also do not say in a corner room, walked into it and it was like a oven so I cranked on the air, i was thinking that i would stick it out to check out the views at night and they we ok, but not worth sitting in the oven. Also the light in the hallway was blinking on and off all night so had to face the other way to sleep, just to tired to deal with front desk about it.  Water pressure in shower was really bad.

We liked the room, and asked reception if we can get the same room when we got back to Cebu next week. They said no problem, but when we came back the same category rooms with double single beds were fully booked. Since we payed in advance I did not want to accept the room with the one king size bed - we are family with two kids. They offered us a upgrade to junior suite for free.

Rooms clean and best feature was how cool and comfortable the whole hotel feels despite the heat outside. Very loud music until 4am the first two nights hampered my sleep but to be fair the hotel did offer me a room switch and apparently this was just a festival and isn't a regular occurrence. The pool is big and clean but the lack of sunbeds and excess number of chairs round the pool is bizarre. Two or three sun loungers but around 14 straight backed chairs. Seemed strange to me!

I was surprised to like it so much, as i was able to get a cheap rate so long as it did NOT include meals.  You dont need meals here, the place is a 5 minute walk to a huge mall with tons of good food choices. MINUSES: i booked partly for the pool. Its rather small, and its got a huge amount of chlorine, if you care about such things. I have no idea why so much. It gets busy and seating is limited around the pool. also, dont try to bring a snack and eat it there, they will try to fine you 300 pesoPLUSES: the rooms have tile floor, they are bright, clean and the beds are nice. Pillows huge. Room has everything you need and wifi is not great but not bad too.  This hotel is larger than i thought, 4 very fast elevators.

rodger51,Mar 2015,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Stay elsewhere,"The Quest is a multi-storey hotel in the Cebu business district, and close to the excellent Ayala mall. Nearby are a number of other similar hotels in the $60 to $80 range, which seems reasonable, especially against Manila prices. But I suggest you choose another hotel, even if you are at first impressed by the appealing hotel foyer. The service was perfunctory. We did we like being lectured on check-in that if we smoked in the room we would face a 5000 peso fine. How rude. We don't smoke, and a small notice placed in the room would have done the job, as it does in other hotels. We got the feeling staff do not want to go out of their way to be friendly or to assist guests. The concierge, when asked for directions, prevaricated, and had to be prompted to offer a local map. We got better guidance from the friendly doorman on the street in front (he was a rare exception). The restaurant staff were inattentive (and the a la carte breakfast was meagre. The corridors (and our room on check-in) were freezing: why do they turn the air conditioning up so high? But our biggest complaint was noise - we could clearly hear the TV in the next room through the wall, and the conversations in the corridor outside, even those some distance away. Sound insulation is appalling. And beware the slippery tiles in the shower. Why didn't they install non-slip tiles? It would seem elementary.

Meian C,Mar 2015,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Bad management,"I was totally disappointed with the hotel,  they don't allow us to late check out, which is very uncommon for this kind of business, we need to pay if we want to check out after 11:00am, YES ! THE CHECK OUT TIME IT 11:00 !!!! if you will check out after that you will need to pay 1,000php for 1:00,2:00pm check out and 1,500 for 3:00 pm and 2,000php for the net hour etc....  And I avail the room through a travel agency and I already pay the payment to the agency for them to arrange my stay , and I don't know why the reception still asking money from me, and she said it is because the agency didn't pay the stay but already booked ?! They don't even bother to help me call the agency because they should be the one to communicate not me M since they have contract with the agency already ! And after that the receptionist even show me the lower price  compare to the agency! That was really really rude ! And when I ask for a bucket of ice they even ask for money ! Oh my God never tried this before !",March 2015,NA

The front desk there are really efficient and the checkin process is seamless (as is the checkout). The room itself is clean and spacious with a nicely organised bathroom. We were lucky and has a corner suite with views in all directions. The restaurant is also good, but a bit pricey, so we did most of our eating at Ayala Mall which is less than 5 minutes walk from the hotel.A cute trait is the way the staff all touch their heart with their hand when they talk to you.

I had a bright and attractive room with floor to ceiling windows, but with good drapes that allowed me to darken it completely for sleep.  It wasn't real big, but was very tastefully designed and had a really comfy bed.  I enjoyed just hanging out in that room!  I had the buffet breakfast one morning and thought it was fairly priced with a wide selection.  Everyone I encountered on the staff was helpful.  My air conditioner started leaking water onto the bed.  I called the front desk and it was fixed immediately.  An hour later the gal from the front desk called to see if I was satisfied with the repair.

A few things I see that needs improvement were the bathroom water pressure (shower was slow so was the toilet flush), dirty glass windows (blocks the wonderful view of the city), air conditioning doesn't work very well. Aside from that everything else were awesome. I would highly recommend to anyone who needs a nice clean place to stay that's close to everything.",January 2015,NA

N9273TL_SteveRC,Jan 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Succeeded in my Quest,Stayed at Quest hotel on recommendation of my girlfriend (whom I was flying there to meet).  Loved the unlimited bacon and eggs and rice breakfast every day.  The trip went very well - she is now my fianc√©e.  Found Quest to be a great hotel and I plan to stay there again when I return to get married.,January 2015,NA
Marc L,Jan 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good Clean Modern Hotel in Cebu City,"I stayed at Quest Cebu for 2 weeks. Check in was very easy and efficient. The front desk staff are professional and nice. I had 2 rooms - a Suite and a Deluxe Room. The suite was large - 2 rooms. A bedroom and a living room. Oddly, in the suite the bathroom was not in the bedroom but in the living room. I didn't appreciate that. The furnishings were comfortable and the bed was good and the pillows were good. Aircon worked well. The Deluxe room had a small balcony which was nice - it was room 717 - no complaints. There is some road noise you can hear in 717 but not too bad. There is also construction going on around Quest Hotel in a number of large high-rise buildings, but not too bad. The room is small but good. The bathroom is also small but fine. Very clean. However, the hot water in the shower is inadequate. In other words, there really isn't much hot water. I thought the breakfast buffet was pretty good. It is mostly the same food over and over, but the variety is above average. There were 2 fresh fruits every day. A large variety of meats and fish and a fresh egg preparation area and another area for the preparation of french toast and pancakes. Overall a good buffet day in and day out. Hotel security is very good and getting a cab is no problem. Free wifi is good but a little slow. Proximity to Ayala mall is excellent, but crossing the road is dangerous. It is about a 10 minute walk if you take the short cut - 15 minutes if you go the 'safer' way. However, don't expect a cross-walk to protect you as it might in Europe or the US. In the Philippines the cross walk doesn't mean much so be advised. Ayala mall is very good. Lots of places to eat and snack and shop and movies. There are small laundry shops within a 5 minute walk of the hotel. I got a large load done on an overnight rush for about $8 USD - a great deal in my opinion. I usually stay at Radisson Blu which is nicer at 2x - 3x the price. For the price, Quest Hotel is a very good value. Overall, a good or better hotel experience in Cebu City.  I would recommend this hotel at the current price point.",January 2015,NA

Location is great, right across the street of the jeepney terminal a Ayala Mall. Room was clean and spacious, as was the bathroom. Didn't experience any issues with hot water as reported by some other reviewers. Wifi was fast but broke down occasionally for 10-20 sec. In-house Puso Restaurant offers great buffets for lunch and dinner at very fair rates. Due to a flight around night time, I had to stay for more than 12 hrs in the lobby after check-out, was not a problem at all. As far as pricing is concerned, apparently you must book online to avail of the special rates most reviewers rave about. If you just walk in and book at the reception, the rate will be much higher.The only weakness I perceived: Breakfast is a little bit too un-Western in my view. No salmon, very few choices of cold cuts.",January 2015,NA

The food was mediocre, at best, although the Chocolate Temptation cake was terrific!  The room and bathroom were clean.  I would suggest going to Mandaue Foam (or similar place) and spending 800 pesos (about $17.50) and but a foam mattress for the top.

The bed was very comfy but I hope they add 2 more pillows. Room was clean but again there's the smell of carpet but you'll get used to it. You need to request a slipper for free if you want.

It is close by the Alaya Shopping centre where there are a wide range of restaurants to choose from. The three different rooms that we had on our visits were all clean and well set up with tea and coffee making, hairdryers etc. The bathrooms are not large but have a reasonable sized shower alcove and toilet and sink. Breakfast variety was reasonable although I did suggest that some muesli or something similiar could be added to the cereal choice. There is no happy hour at the hotel so drink prices are high compared to outside. The staff at this hotel are very courteous and are prepared to do what is necessary to make your stay pleasant. The pool is reasonably small but there is a friendly lifeguard on duty and drinks and snacks available at the pool bar. Joseph,a regular taxidriver at the hotel stand drove us around Cebu for the day and showed us all the sites, he spoke English well and explained details about the sites we saw.

Breakfast was a buffet and I must admit that the staff were cheery and welcoming and the food selections were simple but tasty. There is also a full Omelette station there by request. We did enjoy our 2 night stay there.

The room itself was okay but we had requested one big bed and we got two twin sized beds instead. Would have rather not had the shaggy rug by the foot of the bed as it did not seem so clean to me. We did not opt for the breakfast so I cannot comment on that but we did order room service for dinner and when I called to place our order they did not have over half of the food on the room service menu, which we thought was a waste of our time. It's probably best that they give a true reflection on what is on offer so guests do not waste their time trying to look through the menu.

There is wait staff at the pool and you can order from the resteraunt from there or sit by the pool or bar provided at the poolside. The room was of average space with a very nice large flat screen tv with many cable channels including HBO and History channel. The bathroom was very nicely done with a nice modern shower hot and cold works great. AC was a little on the weak side but it did the job. There was an in room safe provided we used to store our laptop and passports. The refridgerator held some sodas and beer which were as ""the norm"" a little pricey but that's ok. We put our own sodas in there. The service was good but I discovered a small tip will give you excellent and very fast service. If we had stayed at this exact same level in every way hotel in the United States it would have cost us approx three times what we paid. Oh and the close proximity to the Ayala Center is very convenient !

At first, I thought this is just an ordinary hotel.  But checking in for an overnight stay changed my view of the hotel.  The lobby has a very welcoming atmosphere with classy ambiance.  The rooms are neat and dainty with their perpetual white walls and ceilings with minimal colored accents, including the beds.  The toilet and bathroom is spacious enough.  Just needed some more insulation of the main door I think as noise of talking guests outside is very audible inside the room. The Puso Restaurant where we dined and where the countdown was held is spacious and served a variety of good food, particularly with our breakfast.  I just want to see a more complimenting features of its swimming pool in the 7th floor, that it should have been furnished and finished with dainty shades and neat finishing tiles to match the overall hotel character.",December 2013,NA

I stayed over the Christmas period and found all the staff to be well motivated, happy and courteous to all me requests, not that there were many...and a lot of staff made it an effort to remember my name which I think is a nice touch.I had to ask for towels on two occasions as housekeeping didn't leave me with enough but that us the only bad point.  The breakfast buffet was excellent value with a wide selection but they could not cope with the high volume of customers during the last hour of service as a lot of the food counters were empty.The hotel is a short walk from the mall which is very impressive for all shops and restaurants. The hotel gym was well equipped but located near the car parking area but I 'out of choice' decided to use the fitness first gym in the mall which was very good.Altogether I had a very good stay Over the christmas period and will definitely be returning.

The rooms are neat and dainty with their perpetual white walls and ceilings with minimal colored accents, including the beds.  The toilet and bathroom is spacious enough.

I have stayed in the Marriot, Marco Polo, Cebu Midtown, Montebello, Holiday Plaza, and Park Place.  I enjoyed the Quest probably the most! The staff is very freindly and the buffet breakfast rivals the best! It is located just outside Ayalla Mall. (about 6 blocks walking distance). My only complaint was that they advertised free laundry (2 items per day) on their web-site (for stays longer than 5 days). But after checking in; they said it was a promotion limited to certain long stay bookings. However; it wasn't listed that way on their site! No free laundry as advertised; (I stayed 14 days, 2 rooms) I would have rated 5 stars except for this. Other than that, I had a great stay!",October 2013,NA

He also made sure we were well attended to. The second morning too he came by to check if we needed anything and took the time to have a little chat.

Breakfast choices are good as is where is, and moreso when compared again with the others next door.The access from the lobby to the multi level parking lot is a little confusing, as you have to go out a few doors and enter a corridor whose finishing is totally different as that of the hotel lobby, and using a separate elevator to the parking area, making it look like it is the service area (unless it is the service area).",August 2013,NA

I have never experienced better service or more friendly staff in any other location I have stayed. I fell in love with Cebu during my short time there and I have to say it is largely due to the way all the staff at Quest always made me feel very welcome.

When I arrived back from work I noticed that they had installed a light in my back patio. The doorman  bellmen are all very friendly and helpful. That made me feel very special.

MJ L,Sep 2013,1.0 of 5 bubbles,very disappointed :-(,"We booked the Balikbayan package on line. This package requires a two night minimum stay which includes breakfast. The package covers two adults and two children under 12 (I think). When we got there, my family decided to join us. As such, I had my mother and my sister as well as my 9 year old daughter with me. We originally booked a one bedroom with king size bed for two nights. We chose this hotel as it is very close to my 82 year old aunt's home which is the reason why we made a stop in Cebu. When we got there, I was upfront about having extra adult in the room. Right then and there, I was told that I have to pay P1000 extra per night but no extra will be added - no roll-away bed, no extra towels nor extra breakfast.  I was a little bit taken aback by the extra charge when there were only 4 of us and the difference would be that the fourth member of our party is an adult not a child. I was not asking for extra breakfast as I was ready to pay the P500 per person for the breakfast had they not told me to pay the P1000 per night. We decided to go home the following day due to this or move to a different hotel. Told reception on the first night that we will only stay for a night and want a refund for the 2nd night we booked. Not only was I told, there will be no refund as I booked on line, if we eat breakfast at the hotel, I have to pay extra for the 3rd adult in our group. Needless to say, we ate breakfast elsewhere (total cost for the 4 of us was under P500), stayed only one night and no refund. This was the third city we visited during this trip. (Bohol - Bohol Tropics - exceptional service. Palawan - Hotel Centro - the best) Unfortunately, it did not take Quest Hotel long to burst the happy and contented bubble I was in.

Belinda R,Sep 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location with Amazing Customer Service,I checked into the Quest on 9/20 and from the Bellmen to the Manager Kevin they were all very accommodating and very helpful.  I was blown away when I let my bellman know that the room will not work because it is facing the construction and would be loud during the day.  I sleep during the day because I work the nightshift and will not be able to sleep.  The stated he will see what he can do and came back with the Mgr Kevin and changed my room to the other side of the hotel away form the construction.  I also let Kevin know that we would like a light outside because we stay away at nights during our day off and play games to keep up with our schedule.  When I arrived back from work I noticed that they had installed a light in my back patio. The doorman  bellmen are all very friendly and helpful. That made me feel very special.  I also want to take this time to give KUDOS to Ervic and Julius in the restaurant for providing us WORLD CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE with a SMILE.  Love it!,September 2013,NA
peter f,Sep 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"did not expect much, but was truly surprised","I booked a back to back package with this hotel through a agent in Korea and was not expecting a lot as I only paid USD60 for the room, but I was really surprised with the quality and cleanliness of the accommodations I got in Quest. I found the service of the staff to be really above par and hope to see more of this kind of service in the countries I normally travel to. The hotel is only 5 minutes away from the main mall so it easy to access and here you can buy anything you would need to bring back home.",September 2013,NA

Highly recommended to whoever wants a nice, affordable and hospitable service.",September 2013,NA
mcflores88,Sep 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A Different Experience!,Great ambience! I love how the interiors were designed for both the main lobby as well as the room. It really gave me that soothing and relaxing mood. I came from a long business meeting that day and thank god  I was able to have a long and comfortable sleep. Plus of course the corteous staff that made the extra stress go away. I highly recommend Quest Hotel most specially for the one's who are going on business trips to cebu.,July 2013,NA
Immanuel E,Sep 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Mixed-up Inconsistent Hospitality ""though""","Felt so safe the moment I stepped in with the security doing some checking and later after a mall trip, the security seems to immediately recognize their guests, no more of the inspection rituals rather gives a smile of recognition. Ours was an anniversary trip‚Ä¶so I requested for a surprise complimentary drink or tiny cake or cupcake for my partner, and I was surprise they don‚Äôt offer such. So instead I ordered for a couple of house wine which they‚Äôve placed on a rectangular platter with the greetings (Chocolate and fondant flower). I found out after a day that my friend sent a cake which we never received‚Ä¶or the least that could be done was not to accept it if they can‚Äôt bring it to our room or notify us. Now with the good points, very good location, walking distance to Ayala Center, equipped with the basic amenities, very good breakfast buffet( I might forget, except for the not so efficient exhaust, the food smell sticks) , great business center ( very helpful staff), mall shuttle service schedule (great if we had the whole family with us) and the nice big sofa chairs at the lobby. Inside our neat rooms, good bed and two pillows were just too soft, wish we had four on a matrimonial bed. They gave us a corner room, and getting a good view though inside a hotel is always a plus. We‚Äôre happy though, very good value‚Ä¶we‚Äôre coming back",September 2013,NA
Alex Oh,Sep 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent Choice for stay in Cebu for business,"Modern, new, clean,  located in the city center, good  attentive service, and fast wifi. All checks! Mid sized hotel mainly for business travellers. The interiors were like a business-botique type. Bed was super comfortable--soft yet firm. And my corner room with the floor to ceiling windows had a fantastic night panaroma of the city of Cebu . Buffet breakfast also had a good spread, although the buffet stations were not properly laid out/ too spread out. Ayala mall is also just across, although just need to walk a few meters for the pedestrian crossing. Excellent business hotel!",September 2013,NA
MJ L,Sep 2013,1.0 of 5 bubbles,very disappointed :-(,"We booked the Balikbayan package on line. This package requires a two night minimum stay which includes breakfast. The package covers two adults and two children under 12 (I think). When we got there, my family decided to join us. As such, I had my mother and my sister as well as my 9 year old daughter with me. We originally booked a one bedroom with king size bed for two nights. We chose this hotel as it is very close to my 82 year old aunt's home which is the reason why we made a stop in Cebu. When we got there, I was upfront about having extra adult in the room. Right then and there, I was told that I have to pay P1000 extra per night but no extra will be added - no roll-away bed, no extra towels nor extra breakfast.  I was a little bit taken aback by the extra charge when there were only 4 of us and the difference would be that the fourth member of our party is an adult not a child. I was not asking for extra breakfast as I was ready to pay the P500 per person for the breakfast had they not told me to pay the P1000 per night. We decided to go home the following day due to this or move to a different hotel. Told reception on the first night that we will only stay for a night and want a refund for the 2nd night we booked. Not only was I told, there will be no refund as I booked on line, if we eat breakfast at the hotel, I have to pay extra for the 3rd adult in our group. Needless to say, we ate breakfast elsewhere (total cost for the 4 of us was under P500), stayed only one night and no refund. This was the third city we visited during this trip. (Bohol - Bohol Tropics - exceptional service. Palawan - Hotel Centro - the best) Unfortunately, it did not take Quest Hotel long to burst the happy and contented bubble I was in. Yes, the hotel was clean - I'll give them that but the overall experience left a really bad taste I can't forget anytime soon. I am not asking would be customers to stay away or stay here but I just want to warn anyone who would like to stay here to be aware of what you are getting especially when you book on line.",August 2013,NA

Not how we would have wanted to spend the first few days of vacation. The Hotel is conveniently located on the back side of the Ayala Mall with a very busy street to cross. We hear they are working on building a pedestrian bridge, which should fix this minor issue. Overall, it's a great location.The food at their buffet restaurant, Puso, was good as well. Easily the best bacon I've ever had at any hotel! I already miss Kate bringing out fresh Mango for us at breakfast. Great mix of American and Filipino foods. Now for the best part of the stay, the people. We thoroughly enjoy meeting and interacting with the staff. They were way more personable then at the Marriott. And really made us feel like important guest. They went out of their way, more than once, to accomidate request for large parties at the pool and restaurant.

The location is walking distance to the Ayala mall, which is a very nice mall, but you need to get a taxi if you want to go to the centre (Fuente Osmena, Mango). Anyway, taxis are available everywhere and cheap (meter). There is a lot of construction in the area and it is next to a flyover, so I do not rate the location too high.

Now for the best part of the stay, the people. We thoroughly enjoy meeting and interacting with the staff. They were way more personable then at the Marriott.

PutneySW,Jun 2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,A Return Visit.,"I had previously written a complimentary review of my first stay here several months ago, this recent one wasn't so successful.I decided to book a Junior Suite as opposed to my original standard room which was a complete waste of money for the suite is only marginally larger and the bedroom small. Only room for one bedside table in the suite bedroom and tricky navigating around the bed, the bathroom was exactly the same size. The WiFi was next to useless, one could connect but not to the internet, I noticed the router modem was fixed behind a large sideboard unit containing the fridge. In the public areas the WiFi is good but I received no apologies for my complaint.The bed was at least comfortable, the food excellent and the staff charming and well trained although they did completely mess up my 3.00am alarm call which they sent to another guest!They will need to get their act together if they are to compete with the new hotels springing up all over Cebu City and I doubt if I shall return to the QuestRead more",June 2013,NA

There a 711 store just before you cross the road to Ayala Mall too.Overall quite satisfy with this hotel except for the buffet breakfast which choices are not in abundance and filling up is slow,verrrry slow.Overall if you want to stay a few nights in Cebu city this is a very good choice.",May 2013,NA

The location is ideal for people who need to get a cab in a hurry, and those who want to shop and go to mall and hang out with the local senior Americans who stay drinking at the local TGI Fridays.  As far as the hotel is concerned though its very comfortable, the staff is very warming and always gave me smiles.

give_in,Jun 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Sleek  modern rooms, comfortable bed; but long queue during check out","My husband and I had a pleasant stay here, we only stayed overnight.  I love their room, it was sleek and modern.. I love the bed and pillows too.. I don't know if this was because of the bed quality or just because of my lack of sleep the night before since we had a terrible sleep from the other hotel where we came from... Overall i would say the price of the room is quite average. The room was clean and modern, wifi access is quite fast, but it was quite difficult to change the tv channel, you have to type the channel instead of just using the ""up"" / ""down"" or + - buttons at the remote control... My hubby noticed that too.. Anyway, overall our stay was good, although the bathroom sink got clogged before we checked out and what i dont like is the long queue, it took us like an hour just to check out.  I also took some time to write my comments about the long queue during check out, i hope this has improved already... But in general, i would still recommend staying in this hotel, and will definitely stay here when i go back to cebu, i also love its location since it's literally just across ayala mall..

ManilaPat,Apr 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Quest - rest and eat a hearty breakfast,"The Quest hotel is a simple downtown hotel with clean rooms, and a very good bed to sleep in.   The room amenities are ok, to include an in room safe for your valuables.  Like all other hotels, stay away from the mini bar - since most items are priced way above normal.  Just go to the nearest grocery if you want a stash of snacks. The breakfast was a pleasant surprise.  Almost like a big deluxe property, they offered the basic bacon and eggs, but there was also a cheese station, bread station, fruits, juices, congee, pancakes, etc.  If you consider this and the price per room - this is a good deal!",March 2013,NA
ejrobberts,Feb 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,practical hotel,"This hotel opened last year it took some time to finsh but now you can enjoy a new kid in town near Ayala shopping centre. The entrance is well guarded , including a sniffer dog. So it must be priity safe. Cebu has changed a lot since the first time I got here in 1981. Luxuary hotels were very few but now you can make a choice. Quest hotel is one of them. Either for business or leisure, we can recommend this hotel. The restaurent offers a wide range of self service dishes from different continents and a menu choice as well. The breakfast is somewhat on the expensive side. Room service is professional and friendly but this is very common in the Philippines. You feel at home. The frontdesk is somewhat on the small size.

hav4wannatravel,Feb 2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good location but services need to be improved,"Chose this hotel for an overnight business trip for my husband as it's supposed to be right across Ayala Center. However, the walk across the public terminal to get to the mall is really oppressive, crossing the street right where the flyover drops off means you will need to navigate through high speed traffic. Once you cross over to the other side, you encounter pedestrian traffic and the fumes from the PUVs at the public terminal. This was not at all pleasant, so my solution for the following day was to wait for the hotel shuttle to take me 5 minutes across to the mall. Unfortunately, there are only 3 or 4 schedules for the entire day (as it's the same van that services their Mactan property) which makes this impracticable. They really should have a dedicated shuttle offering more frequent service if they mean to cater to the guests who are there for convenient access to Ayala Center.The good points for me are as follows. When Quest acquired this property (I'm not sure what it was previously), they seemed to have put in some capital to furnish it with good beds (nicely firm and well-lined, quality linen, even bathroom fixtures (grohe, hcg) and finishings, etc. Even the bathroom toiletries were mostly of acceptable quality for a business hotel (except the towels were thin and not generous) if rather spartan (""conditioning"" shampoo with no proper separate conditioner, no lotion, etc. though the toilet paper was of good quality--something I always gauge a hotel by!) The breakfast buffet was also of commendable value considering it was included in the room price. The spread was not big but the quality for me was satisfactory. It consisted of a small congee station, the usual breakfast fare (bacon, chipolata, french toast, the local dried fish delicacy), some hot items on chafing dishes, but also an egg station, a sizable selection of breads, muffins, danishes, cereals, a few cheeses and nuts and a section for fruit, fresh juices and yogurts (looked like they were made in-house and came in about 4 flavors which I all loved! this was my fave part of this spread). If only for the yogurt, I may consider staying again. The wi-fi was also good during our stay.That said, there is much room for improvement particularly with housekeeping that I encountered during my stay. Cleanliness-wise, I would rate it 3 out of 5. At first glance, it looks clean enough. The devil is in the details. There was one hair near the trash bin under the writing table and another on the far side of the water closet closest to the wall. The grouting on the sink is stained although cleaned. When I tried to make tea, the inside of one of the tea bags had dust on the crease (obviously from being recycled there for a while), but the other bag was fine. There were only 2 very small complimentary bottles of water. There was no water (free or otherwise) in the mini bar so when I wanted to make tea that night, I called housekeeping to ask for water. This took 3 follow up calls and about 45 minutes. The room that we stayed in also had a grounded light bulb which we only noticed after all the lights were out. That meant it blinked all night even though switched off and we were just too tired to try to call maintenance at that time after the frustrating time asking for simple water for tea.  The most problematic issue was the noise level coming from both outside the hotel and from the hallways. Walls were thin and  I could hear the comings and goings of nearby rooms till about 3am and as early as 5am (fortunately, I was the only light sleeper while my husband slept through). The noise coming from outside was also loud (it's in the center of town afterall) but was exacerbated by the cracks on the service window (although this was locked) where they installed the outdoor unit of the split type a/c. They could put a double panelling here if they wanted to address this.Overall, the service at front desk was very good and the staff were helpful bu there are major things this hotel can improve on before I would consider another stay.Read more",February 2013,NA

LOVEME2011,Jan 2013,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointing New Year Experience from a Quest,It was new years day and we selected this hotel because it was on sale. The room we got was really nice. What got me disappointed was the fact that they don‚Äôt have towels available on their swimming pool when we went there around 2pm. The pool attendant just plainly told us that no towel is available which is weird since they should know that it‚Äôs expected that people will swarm the pool at this time of the day. We have 4 kids with us and I was so upset that they did not extend any help whatsoever. So I spoke to Nestle the duty manager and complained about the situation. The next day to my surprise the same thing happened. It‚Äôs still 8am and again no towel is available. What a shame. Nice pool but poor service. Whatever excuse that they don‚Äôt have any towel is unacceptable and my kids are feeling cold and shaking. I didn‚Äôt bother calling back because it‚Äôs evident that my initial complain didn‚Äôt really work at all.  Disappointing service from Quest Hotel. To add-breakfast was not that good.

I didn‚Äôt bother calling back because it‚Äôs evident that my initial complain didn‚Äôt really work at all.  Disappointing service from Quest Hotel. To add-breakfast was not that good. I asked for bacon-refill and the waiter just said to wait but after I came back it's still empty. No apologies whatsoever. I will never go back there again.,January 2013,NA

Michael_Asombrado,Dec 2012,4.0 of 5 bubbles,New hotel with the perfect location,My wife and relatives stayed here during our layover to and from Boracay. The hotel is new and well staffed. Location is perfect as it is infront of the Ayala mall and there are taxis waiting just outside. All other attractions in Cebu are just minutes. Overall a good option while in Cebu.,December 2012,NA
TheSwagman,Dec 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great place to stay,We stayed 3 nights early December 12 and stayed in the Junior Suite as it had  a pull out for the kids and a separate room for us. The Ayala is right across the road (which was busy and  there was always a security guard to to stop traffic and help you across). The breakfast buffet was great. A good place to stay,December 2012,NA
Karen G,Dec 2012,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Location,"The Good: Location. Very convenient because its right across Ayala Mall. Room is very ""boutique"" in style. Clean and has everything you need. Staff were friendly and service was fast. They also have a nice pool deck. The Bad: Just one I can comment about. I wasn't too happy with the breakfast buffet and it was too expensive for the selection they had.",November 2012,NA

Maartje B,Aug 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent hotel,"We stayed twice at the Quest hotel during our trip in the Philippines and it was just excellent. Although pricey for Philippine standards (around 3000 pesos per night), it was worth every peso. The hotel is located just across the street from the Ayala mall, the only point of interest in Cebu if you ask me :) The staff is really friendly, the rooms are clean and beautiful, really good beds and showers, the pool is nice... I got sick the second time we stayed here and they arranged for a nurse to come see me, all free of charge. The only downside was that the chicken soup that I ordered was really disgusting, other than that we did not try the restaurant but it is supposed to be good.",July 2012,NA
IceQueenDevika,Aug 2012,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Very convenient!,"Spent a weekend in the hotel.  Got two connecting rooms to accommodate the four of us.

We commend their great service and utmost courtesy of all the staff.. The reception even granted our request for an early checkin at 12nn instead of the 2pm sked.. The buffet lunch and buffet breakfast have great selection of sumptuous dishes.. Great value for money.. We'll definitely come back and will recommend this hotel to family and friends..
