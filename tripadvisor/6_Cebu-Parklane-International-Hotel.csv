Elena N,Jun 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice stay in the city,"We stayed in this hotel for two seperate nights. The pool was closed the first day we were there and the hottub was still closed the second day about a week later.Still, the hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are big and clean, especially the bathrooms. The roomservice and restaurant in general were excellent.Would choose to stay here again.",June 2023,Traveled as a couple
Marcus J,Feb 2023,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Enjoy and worth the price,"The food was amazing and also the staff. During dinner, we order grilled fish and balbacua. The fish was delicious and also I don't eat balbacua in other restaurants but here I already taste it and it was soso. On the day that we're here there will be a band and we join the singing. All in all, it was a great experience.",February 2023,Traveled with friends

But international travelers. Donâ€™t go here !! The food is so basic.  Boreing variety hard to eat this food day in day out.  Then thereâ€™s the greesy floors in dinning area.  Yuc!

Stephen J,Aug 2022,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Needs more work to make this a great international hotel,"This hotel doesnâ€™t train its staff in customer service , as far a we could tell as apart from the manager and the concierge the performance of the staff was woeful especially in the forth floor bar/ restaurant. We found that the food was cold when it arrived at the table as it was cooked on the ground floor then relayed up to the forth floor, the food took a very long time to arrive and one of the meals was the wrong dish as the waiter took no notes. I thought breakfast was average and I could not recommend it. Overall they need to pick up their game and train the staff in what customers expect when they pay out hard earned money",August 2022,Traveled with friends
Sticksnstone,Aug 2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,THANK YOU PARKLANE!,"Nice hotel with friendly, courteous and efficient  staff. The lobby is beautiful and the buffet had many good choices for breakfast/dinner. We did not have a chance to try the lobby snack area, pool or gym. Our room was spacious, nicely decorated. Only disappointment was the bathroom which needed to be updated (fixtures, tub).  Also requested a massage in our room for both my husband and I. It was so appreciated and reasonably priced. Crystal is a jewelry store in the lobby which had some unusual nice pieces.  The airport transport arranged through the hotel was convenient and on time. I would definitely return to this hotel when we visit Cebu again.",August 2022,Traveled with family

Benjamin M,Jul 2021,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great stay,"I had a fantastic couple of days in this amazing place. I lived in the philippines for 7 years and been to cebu countless times but didn't stay here before.  The gym is probably one of the best ones in the city and the room views are straight from travel mags.  The manager Jerome and Caryl the receptionist made my stay easier even I had some payment issues due to my credit card and were super accommodating and friendly. If you're coming to the city just stay here to chill, there is a jacuzzi, bar and pool on the 4th floor. Regards to the waiters Edelito and Joseph who were very nice as wellðŸ¥°",July 2021,NA
julie ann,May 2021,4.0 of 5 bubbles,We had so much fun swimming!,"We stayed there for two nights after new year's day and we had a great time. The location, the room, and the amenities were great.  I was just wondering why no one came to clean our room even though the hotel was not busy at all. (They eventually came to clean after we called them to do so). Also, not sure if they cleaned the carpet. Nevertheless, our goal was to relax and spend quality family time and I believed we have achieved that.",December 2020,NA

The bathroom smelt like sewer drain, when asked to move rooms we were moved to a room without a Queen bed that still had the bad smell in the bathroom. The wifi cut out continuously.

JohnYa5,Nov 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A good place tasty near the Ayala Mall.,We finally managed to stay at the Cebu Parklane Hotel.  We had a nice room. It was a little aged. They are remodeling some of the rooms so that one was probably on the list. You need your room card to set an elevator floor to keep outsides from getting on your floor. they have a nice pool on the fourth floor and an amazingly large well equipped workout room. They have an ATM machine in the lobby. We wish we saw that right away as we were out walking around to find one.Read more,October 2018,NA

Curious152962,Sep 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Noisy hotel close to Ayala mall,"Cebu Parklane international hotel is currently renovating some floors which is required as well as the room we stayed in was according to expected standard but has already seen quite a lot of use. Especially the carpet was well worn. Air-con was working just enough and was making only little noise which made the noise from the heavily trafficked road in front of the hotel very noticeable. As the road is used very much even during nights, honking, engine noise and people shouting could be heard all during the night (room on the 7th floor, uneven numbers there) and made it sometimes difficult to sleep. Pool was close to the restaurant so while swimming you can watch people eat and vice versa - depends whether you are personally disturbed by this or not.Bottom line, you get your moneyâ€™s worth but the street noise was unfortunately difficult to bare sometimes. This however, might be a common problem in this part of town also for other hotels.Read more",September 2018,NA

Jacob,Sep 2018,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Can be better,"The staff of the hotel were friendly, efficient and accommodating, but the hotel itself can still be improved. Maybe it was just the room we booked, but ours had a malfunctioning air conditioning unit and the TV wasnâ€™t connected to anything. We couldnâ€™t watch the news or any other channel, so it was really quite boring. Room service was quick, but the food was poor. Breakfast was fine, but can be improved if they they added more choices for diners and guests.",September 2018,NA
Robert H,Sep 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Peaceful Stay,"Nothing better than walking into a hotel that is so relaxing and laid back.  As well as being professional.  The rooms are large, quiet and comfortable. Able to relax and unwind.  Swimming pool,  Spa and Jacuzzi makes it ideal for yourself or family. Food is amazing,  from American food to Filipino food.  Both served hot, fresh and made that day. Chefs are ready to serve only the best.  Coffee Bar has wonderful desserts to go along with a nice variety of drinks.  From the smoothies to the Cafe Mocha. Plenty of activities to keep you busy.  Ayala Mall is just a hop, skip and jump away. Well within walking distance.  Plenty of restaurants to cater to your needs.  Stay indoors and order food from room service or go down and enjoy food from the other restaurant in the hotel.",September 2018,NA
Usasenior,Sep 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Very nice especially if you avoid weekends and the high seasons,"Many have noted that this is an old hotel seriously in need of renovation (though likely the more expensive rooms are better) and the convenient location is offset by the high noise level surrounding it  ,especially on the street side and near the elevators, and also in the first floor restaurant.  However as always I solved this problem with earplugs.  I am puzzled by the comments about poor internet as I spent two months in half a dozen hotels and many malls etc. in Cebu City and this place had by far the best connection I found.  I discovered why when I spoke to their tech (who appeared within minutes in my room to solve a problem with my laptop) who told my that, unlike most places in the third world, who have only a single connection, they subscribe to 3 different net providers and use an expensive device that combines the signals, so unlike all other places here, I had a superb connection day and night for the 4 days of my stay so this is a major plus.   Yes, like many places they had few and inconveniently placed power sockets in my standard room , but as always I travel with a long power cord so this was not an issue for me.   The pool and gym are nice but like most places they sell daypasses or memberships so they can be crowded at times when school is out or after 4pm or weekends.  I was happy with my stay but I will likely find a more tranquil place in the future.",October 2017,NA
anngie a,Sep 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very near Ayala Mall. Comfortable stay fit for a princess.,"I love the location as it is very near Ayala Center and other business hotels. They provide good service and the staff were attentive to my needs. They sure know how to take good care of their guest. They have  spacious, well lit rooms with large comfortable beds and large Led tv's. Got a room with a bath and amazingly the tub was free from grime. Just what i needed for a hot bath after a stressful day outside. The hotel got a gym right beside the pool / jacuzzi area. I love the buffet meal. Was all satisfying and was worth the price you paid for.",June 2018,NA
baysoinpdfla,Aug 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,MOSTLY SATISFIED,"I was mostly satisfied with the Hotel. most of the buffet where good except for the Asian Night buffet, which was overpriced for what was offered. Asked for a bath with shower, but one wasn't available till later in my stay.I noticed that the whole time I stayed there , the housekeeping never vacummed my room.  I also had to stay one more night than planned and felt like they could have honored my original price per night, but choose to allow me to stay at a much higher rate. Overall it was a pleasent stay.",August 2018,NA
Dushi1996,Aug 2018,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Terrible,"The price is not fit to the room, it's too much over price.Also bad that TV is no national Graphic, HBO or whatever.Obnly filipino channels..also not good that you have no suckets to charge next to the bed.You must take a shower inside in a bath tube,you have a reef in the room but its totally empty..The worst is they dont even have coffee in the room. Unbelievable .",August 2018,NA
Steven C,Jul 2018,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Professional Service First Time in Philippines,"Finally, after traveling for business at Philippines in 6 years; I encountered the professional services in this hotel by FB Supervisor, Ms. Felisor Alameda.She called the rental car driver to secured and returned my cell phone left in the car from Cebu airport.

The location is great for Ayala mall and you will need to cross 2 busy roads. The taxi's are metered and cheap compared to UK. You could also get a habalhabal bike to take you to skim past the horrendous traffic. The traffic is really bad and took us about 50minutes to get to airport. CHEAP FORM OF TRANSPORT - i found that theres many Jeepneys with numbers on them which go a certain route the drivers are very helpful and will tell you where they go it is also written in graffitti on a jeepney.

My 5 year old daughter loves to swim and play around water and the pool at parklane is perfectly adequate and most of the time children use the round whirlpool beside the pool , so it was to my amazement that one of the smoking areas at pool level is right next to this area (why ?) because of this I would not let my daughter use the whirlpool .

I have never experienced a hotel that books you in a room with an ongoing construction in the next room. The bed linens were dirty and we have foam pillows. I mean, come on, foam pillows? Locals calls ain't free too. And when I asked for the manager to air my complaints, he does not want to talk to me. Geez, all he does is hide in his cubicle and lets his subordinates handle my problem. Lousy customer service. Trust me, i know and i have tried 4 star rated hotels and this ain't it.

PolarKoala,Aug 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Ideally located,"We thought the lobby was nice and welcoming and very fragrant, it was just so nice to come in from the heat and the sweat! The staff all very friendly. We met the hotel nurse who took the time to help identify nearby dermatology clinics, and give us useful advise as my husband had insect bites on his legs. It was such a relief! Loved the location in that it is  short walk away from Ayala Centre Cebu, so handy especially for last minute shopping. The only problem is it can get rather challenging to get across the road, very busy with no traffic regulation set up. Can get quite hairy. We got a very good sized room with two double beds and good sized bathroom. The corridors are very nice. The rooms are okay. Carpet and chairs aren't great, marked/stained due to age, could use some freshening up. The beds are comfortable though, good wifi in all areas. Oh, I better not forget to mention the delicious breakfast! Lots of Filipino options! Plus they provided us with mangoes on tap and my husband and I were very happy with that.

cutandsew,Aug 2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Looks can be Deceiving,"I stayed here on May 30th. Thank goodness it was only for one night, but I did book for two rooms for other family members. The front desk personnel were helpful and placed us in rooms that were next to each other.  It is well situated being just steps to popular Ayala Mall Center, but you have to cross a very busy main road. We were dismayed that for the price of the rooms, about $125 a night, the rooms were small for a standard and the bathrooms were so small that it is only enough for you to turn, and you better do it slow or else you will be kissing the door!!! I booked also through Booking.com in January, who in my past dealings with them, the transaction was always paid for already. To my surprise, I was charged again. At the time, I didn't have any receipts to show of my payment, and so just paid them for both rooms. When I got back home after a couple weeks, it didn't show on my statements either!! So I just let it go. Only this week I found the email from the credit company saying that Parklane did get a payment way back in January. So I am back with the credit card company on this! I was disappointed with my stay here as breakfast wasn't even included.  You are better off staying at Cebu Mandarin Hotel which is only across the street, for much better accomodations for a walk-in price of $60 for a deluxe twin room including a great breakfast buffet. I will not recommend Parklane nor will I ever stay here again!",May 2016,NA

They had lots of choices for salads, an assortment of bread and Danishes, doughnuts, breakfast meats and other surprise dishes like salt and pepper squid and really yummy crispy fried lechon, which ran out before the breakfast buffet closed.

ExaminerUk,Mar 2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Enjoyable stay,"The hotel lobby is large and well lit with a sense of grandeur. Reception staff were helpful and check in was efficient.  Rooms are somewhat dated, bathrooms are small and some carpets look decidedly tired, but everything is clean and my stay was very comfortable.  The breakfast and evening buffets were extensive and the staff were generally attentive. The coffee served in the Lobby cafÃ© is great.The hotel has a convenient location with a large mall within easy walking distance where there are plenty of shopping and eating experiences awaiting you.Depending on the room you occupy, outside traffic noise could be an issue, but I would be more than happy to return to Cebu and stay at this hotel.Read more",February 2014,NA

iamshutterbugbabe,Sep 2012,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Don't even bother checking in this hotel. Poor facilities!,"Checked in at Park Lane on a business trip. I was checked in at the 11th floor. Although the room was spacious, the facilities were very poor.  Spent the whole day on meetings and it was already after dinner when I returned to my room. The phone wasn't working (it was an IP phone) so I had to use my mobile to call the front desk for assistance. Housekeeping came after 15 mins and said he'll ask their IT guy to check. Then the TV remote controls were not working. Called again using my mobile. Another 15 mins passed by before housekeeping came back to inform me that their IT guy is already off-duty and that they'll transfer me to another room. I said ok. After which the TV guy came and helped me fix the TV issue. 30mins has passed and still no one from concierge came to pick up my stuff and transfer me to another room. Called front desk using my mobile. Finally someone came and transferred me to a new room. But alas, the TV isn't working again. So I called for help, apparently there should be another remote control (the one in my room is the cable box remote) and they will just send the remote. After 10 mins the technical guy that came didn't have any remote with him, apparently he wasn't informed. He tinkered for awhile with the remote and said he will call for help. By this time I was already so pissed that I practically kicked him out of the room. It was already late nearing 12MN and I've been given the runaround by these support staff who don't seem to know how to operate the equipment in the room in the first place. Facilities are just so bad.I will not recommend this hotel. Very bad service!Read more",September 2012,NA

The concierge and business centre staff assisted us to liase to get our luggage back, as they have a booth at the airport they arranged to collect it and transported it to the hotel with other passengers without charge to us.

xploring666,Jan 2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice Hotel Good Area,Both me and my partner were treated extreamly well over almost a week here.  The staff is treated us very good. The rooms were small but clean and well maintained.  The breakfast buffet was excellent and good meal.  I love the coffee shop in the lobby they do a wonderful cappuccino and freshed baked bread in the morning.  The only downside is the restaurant is overpriced for meals after the breakfast.I stayed at a number of hotels in the Philippines on ths trip.  This one ranked at the top during the trip.  I will stay there again next time.,January 2011,NA
Trine1977,Jan 2011,3.0 of 5 bubbles,OK enough,"Our first stay in Cebu was at the Diplomat, which was dreadfull. Decided on return to add some pesos and stay at a nicer place. This was much better! We asked for a no smoking room but were placed on a smoking floor in a smoking room. We could have protested but didn't bother. Hotel is almost right next to Ayala mall, good for us as this is where we spent the afternoon. There are a few new hotels abit further down the street opening these days, and was told that you could make a bargain here compared to what we paid at the Parklane.",December 2010,NA
affiliatelife,Jan 2011,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good breakfast.. but not my choice in Cebu,"This hotel is cheap and the breakfast was good. However I will not book it again. I got a dated room close to the elevators, which constantly went ding dong and could be heard clearly into my room. The shower leaked through the wall so the bathroom floor was soaked, and the shower was horrible anyway. The wired or wireless internet did not work in the room.. after the first night I had enough and I booked another hotel (Radisson Blu). Parklane made me pay for three nights, but I didn't care, I just wanted a nice room with proper facilities and the internet as I run my business online.If you plan to stay in the Parklane ask for a room far from the elevators and for goodness sake ask for a deluxe room or suite or something other than the standard. I still think you'd be better off at the Marriott because that is right next to Ayala shopping center and you can access it from within the shopping center. The Parklane is close but you have to cross a very busy street and there's no traffic lights so you better run... Besides you don't want to be walking around the hotel at dark. I would not choose Parklane if you have children, seniors or anyone with any kind of disability that effects walking quickly. The Marriott, although double the price, seems a much better option if you are looking to stay close to Ayala.",January 2011,NA

The staff behind the reception counter have been trained not to look at you, not to smile and to talk in a low voice so you have to ask them to repeat themselves all the time. They have a very bad attitude problem and I am sure its to do with the training. Its not a great hotel by a long shot but it tries to charge great hotel prices!",October 2010,NA
330aviator,Nov 2010,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent value,"Very good value for money  and convenient location.   Walking distance to Ayala Mall which is the biggest Mall in Cebu.    The staff   [ everyone  we came across]  were very friendly and efficient.    The rooms  are not very big  but  very clean and comfortable.  My room aircon did not work very well the first night but we got a room  change from second night.  All rooms have tea / coffee making facilities, mini bar and safe.The restaurent  breakfast buffet  is  very good but with limited choice.  Night clubs are only a short taxi ride away. Free Wi-Fi available but I did not tryout the internet so can't comment on speed.",November 2010,NA

,Oct 2009,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Parklane ,"I visited Cebu last May 2009 and chose Parklane because it is close to Ayala Mall and close to my sister's house.  It is one of the new hotels in town and I liked my spacious room.  The only thing I didn't like is the huge construction going on.  My niece wanted to use the pool but it faces the construction site in full view of the workers.  The pedestrian lane going to the mall is a block away.  It's kinda risky crossing the streets when drivers are all in a hurry. I like the bell boys, very helpful and attentive. Some of the receptionists are not as gracious (maybe just got overwhelmed or something).",October 2009,NA
,Sep 2009,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Parklane Hotel - Excellent Value,"This hotel is very clean and modern with an excellent staff.  The food and restaurants are excellent.  Rooms are typical of 4 star hotels and unlike some hotels in the Cebu area they are clean, quiet and modern with consistent hot water.  This is easily the best value in the Cebu metro area and should remain a bargain with 2 huge hotels being constructed directly across the street.  We were very happy with our stay and will go back again.",September 2009,NA
