The front office and the rooms are a different story. They‚Äôll need to improve the tangibles and the service in order to merit thumbs up. The Banquet Facilities are good. Spacious and cool. Well set-up. With great technical support from engineering (special mention Marlon - he is technically competent, pleasant, prompt). Banquet Service is excellent.

They give Bai a very good name. They MUST be recognized and commended internally!Cafe Bai food is hands down the BEST! The quality is great! The variety is great! And most of all, the FB staff do their job Very Well! Maricel Newman leads them very well! She is experienced and sets a very good example. The rest of her team is equally as good! Rowel, Rachel, Lenie - they all have smiling welcome expressions consistently, they serve very well. Like the banquet staff, they are swift, responsive and they anticipate and think of what you need even before you ask. They MUST be recognized and commended internally as well!The front office and the rooms division - they have a lot of work to do to catch up. The front office (next to the guards and bellman) is the first encounter you have with the hotel. And unfortunately, they‚Äôre not consistently good. Sometimes you meet someone who‚Äôs competent and who knows his/her job, most of the time you are handled by personnel who give the vibe of being unsure. They‚Äôre not sharp nor fast. You‚Äôll need to wait your turn most of the time. Their turnaround time could be faster. As for the rooms? Very inconsistent. You get rooms that are ok. They give you welcome pastries or drinks, you are welcomed with your name on the screen and in cards addressed to you personally, you have complete amenities and everything works. But at other times (this last trip was one for the books!), you get a really bad experience: no more welcome pastries (they call the next day and say sorry they forgot) AND the TV doesn‚Äôt work (housekeeping looks at it, is helpless, so calls IT and IT fixes it - supposedly! - and assures you it‚Äôs ok, and then it bogs down again). They transfer you to another room (because you repeatedly complain) - but in that next room, you face a TV that works tbf (but it uses ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù and hieroglyphics for you to understand how it works - it‚Äôs customer unfriendly! - they acknowledge and explain that they upgraded the TV but still use the old remote so it‚Äôs hard to use). The new room you‚Äôre transferred to does not have hot water (faucet on the sink) and is dirty (the housekeeping did not see the dirt (a used plastic they must have overlooked below the mirror near the sink). The door jamb is also stuck all the time. The pillows are not as soft. Sigh. The duty manager comes to you and apologizes profusely and does what he can to pacify you.

There was also a buffet breakfast offered! Everyone was extremely pleasant, even the concierge that helped us get transportation to our next destination of Moalboal.

We had already come four years ago and really liked this hotel.It is ideally located. The food is delicious and the restaurants are excellent, the staff is extremely kind and ready to do anything to make you happy. But this time we were really disappointed with the condition of the rooms. They smell of humidity, black stains of humidity everywhere, not very clean, stains of dirt we even had a visit from a cockroach. The television system is also a little faulty. The other negative point is the accounting of expenses.We had made a deposit of 6000 pesos by credit card but at the roof top they refused to put the bill on my room because I had supposedly not made a deposit. When I went to reception, they confirmed my deposit and they told me that they had to investigate, I never heard back from this investigation...In short, it is very high time to renovate the rooms, it is good to be very strict on safety and on protective measures against covid-19, but not at the expense of the cleanliness of the rooms.

The other negative point is the accounting of expenses.We had made a deposit of 6000 pesos by credit card but at the roof top they refused to put the bill on my room because I had supposedly not made a deposit. When I went to reception, they confirmed my deposit and they told me that they had to investigate, I never heard back from this investigation...In short, it is very high time to renovate the rooms, it is good to be very strict on safety and on protective measures against covid-19, but not at the expense of the cleanliness of the rooms.

Leonard D,May 2022,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Almost Perfect and easy to improve to it,"I've been here about 6 days. Everything is great about this hotel except for two big things. It is basically a 4-star hotel in every way imaginable but has 1-star hotel beds and 1-star hotel internet. If it weren't for the phenomenal, consistent  superb customer service rendered by Medardo on a daily basis I would have long been gone to a hotel that has better stable wifi connectivity  much better beds. The internet crashes a lot and you spend a lot of time looking at a spinning cursor which it absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that is great in every way besides what appears to resemble dial-up speeds and connectivity regardless of what the numbers say. It's very obvious the hotel is bottlenecking data to the extreme just to save money at the customer's expense with available bandwidth. The other complaint is the mattress selections. The quality in them cannot be compared because there is none. It is almost as hard as laying on the ground. I saw this complaint in a review before I booked here but gave it the benefit of the doubt. That was a mistake. The rooftop restaurant/bar is great too with beautiful scenery as well as the one on the 21st floor. Great dining areas too in their cafe on the 2nd floor. Very easy to get a taxi here as well and their shuttle is flexible for trips to places too. So Bai hotel if you are listening, fix the two things above and you'll see your reviews and reception from the public not to mention future sales peak to its highest capacity ever. Keep doing the great things you're doing like employing staff like Medardo and others that render great customer service and make it so it's easier to reach staff on your phone services too.

Our anniversary cake was beautifully presented. Mr. Ian Bartender/Waiter was outstanding, he gave undivided attention to each table and each guest even they are busy. Assistant Manager Ronel has a warm service and has a good photography skills. We can notice all are working and helping together hand and hand, the security officer Jhunel is the one who dish out our plates, he still got the skills since he worked 4 years in a fast food chain while he was studying at the same time. And last but not the least the guard who assist us to call us a taxi, he sanitized the front and back seats of the car before we let us enter on it. Overall was superb, best customer service we had here in Cebu City so far! You really make our 9th year wedding anniversary to be remembered.",December 2021,NA

Restituto Faeldonea,Jun 2020,1.0 of 5 bubbles,WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE,"I booked this hotel for the 2 day waiting period for corona virus results for people who flew in from LA, they only gave 1 bottle water for 2 days then force you to buy from them for 120 pesos for a 500ml water bottle, when i booked this hotel we were promised 3 meals per day, our first day here while waiting 2 HOURS for the staff to assign us our rooms, we were not given our breakfast or lunch meals, we were forced to wait for our dinner meals, we were also not allowed to order from delivery services leaving their hotel menu as our only option where the minimum you'll spend on a meal is 400 pesos. This whole establishment is a way to take advantage of people flying from outside of the Philippines, it's a money making scam. The room's airconditioning never gets cold, when you try to ask for help from maintenance they'll send a guy 1 hour and 30 minutes later, same with food and water orders, so far I have waited 2 hours and 45 minutes I've called reception more than 5 times already and all they say is they'll follow up with housekeeping, also dont expect your meals to be much, for breakfast they served 2 pieces of vienna sausage and a hardboiled egg, that's probably worth no more than 50 pesos for a room worth 3500 pesos per night.

Dave L,Apr 2020,1.0 of 5 bubbles,not a place for me,"i have stayed here 3 times ,in 2018 and  twice in sept 2019 . the hotel is fairly new,,,its not near the city really and is 15 ..20 mins from airport.. there is sort of a mall or a strip mall not to far..the area is not to good to stroll around because of traffic.the staff were ok... air con barely efficient.the deal breaker for me was management being a foreigner that lives in new york and am accustomed to a management customer service that has common sense and is hospitable in times of crisis this is where the Bai hotel fails miserably in my opinion",September 2019,NA
P_pixie_1990,Mar 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Modern, clean, comfortable and close to the airport!","Bai Hotel Cebu was the perfect whistle-stop hotel between islands. After a long flight from London, we spent the night here before flying to another island the following day. The facilities were so modern and nice, the rooftop pool and bar was lovely, the room was comfortable and clean, the gym had so much equipment to use and the spa was open such great hours we could get a late night ""jet-lag"" friendly massage. Highly recommend when in Cebu, super close to the airport (but be ware of traffic at peak times!) and wonderful staff and facilities.",February 2020,NA

saij g,Mar 2020,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hotel, but need hand/face towels!","So I stayed here twice.  1 night, then 2 nights same week. For a brand new hotel that is close to 4 star, I'm confused why you don't have a hand towel in the rooms. I had 3 rooms altogether, and none of them had handtowels, so this isn't a mistake. We had 2 bath towels, not even a face towel. It's just annoying washing your hands, and you don't have anything to wipe it with, except reaching in the overhead shower to grab the bath towels. Otherwise, Front Desk/Bell staff, lobby lounge staff and entertainment were excellent, breakfast buffet was 5 star I can say that. Of course, the staff at the Ume restaurant were so wonderful for making my partner's birthday so special. We enjoyed a late dinner with delicious food, attentive staff, and relaxing ambiance. I asked the waiter if they had a cake with a candle for my love to blow on his birthday, and they made it happen. Thank you!",March 2020,NA

Denise S,Nov 2019,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Outstanding service, strategic location, excellent views","Absolutely lived my staycation in Bai Hotel in Mandaue! (I believe it's the newest hotel in Mandaue and Cebu City, well accdg to my Grab driver). Super clean everywhere! Everyone greets you warmly and always with a smile. Excellent buffet breakfast spread, wide variety of choices. Has in-house restaurants (steak resto and Japanese resto), great cafe and the 21st pool area gives you a breathtaking view of Mandaue and Cebu (esp. at night). The hotel is right across Park Mall where there are tons of affordable restos and also the usual Jollibee, McDonald, a 24hour convenience store (not sure if it was Mini Stop or 7-11), SM supermarket, but my favorite among all of them - the Choobi Choobi resto (must try's: Gambas, Baked Scallops and veggie dish Tao Miao, then wash it all down with Watermelon Shake). There's a big Rico's Lechon resto at the back of Park Mall. Always has taxis in front of hotel. And the popular malls are within 10 to 15 minute taxi ride from hotel (Robinsons, Ayala, SM). If you want to go further, you can also go to SM Seaside mall. Only had a few minor complaints during my Cebu trip: the airport really needs an overhaul, and the renovation on the departure wing, OMG! The AC units are so few, you cannot feel an ounce of AC comfort while waiting for your flight. I commend the steak, the delicious Japanese menu, but Bai Hotel needs to improve on their Chinese menu/taste. I ordered hot  sour soup and stir fry noodles from room service - the hot  sour soup lacks sourness and is a bit salty, and the stir fry noodles, I didn't enjoy and didn't finish. But all the other food I ate at the hotel and the rest of non-Chinese dishes I ordered are great! That's it. Looking forward to going back to Cebu and a stay in Bai Hotel!",August 2019,NA

We did have a slight problem with one of the rooms but the manager stepped in and upgraded us....she did a great job of making us happy as guests.Keep up the good work and if you want a nice place to stay then my wife and I recommend the Bai Hotel !!!!!,September 2019,NA

The Twilight Bar/Lounge (23rd level) likewise is another great vantage point to chill out as you gaze at the city lights. Our two rooms lived up to our high expectations of a 4-star hotel with the staff being exceptionally courteous and helpful. The only downside is that Check In time is at 3pm and Check Out time is at 11am - which isn't the norm in other hotels. In effect, your stay has been cut by 2 hours and one feels shortchanged.

Better ask for ""danggit"" once you take your breakfast, it will not be displayed that seems to be precious.

After we checked in, we went up to the pool.  The trip had been very trying, I wanted a martini.  The person behind the bar poured straight warm gin in a rocks glass and handed it to me.  The price of that one drink was 550 piso (a bit over $11 US).  It was a wet, nasty, windy day, and my lady friend was cold, so I went to the bar and ordered her a cup of coffee with a shot of Kahlua.  A different person was behind the bar.  I ""explained"" that I'd just been served the worst martini of my life.  He replied, ""i'll make you a martini sir"", reached into the freezer and pulled out a chilled martini glass.  ""Good start"" I thought.  When the drinks were delivered to our table, my martini had BLACK olives.  Again, fantastic hotel, but they need to train their bartenders.",February 2019,NA

The staff was extremely pleasant and totally service oriented especially Restie, Michelle and Rose from Executive Lounge. We booked an executive room , the price was very competitive however it was worth it with their great service. I suggest if you want to try Bai you should book for Executive room since it comes with an access and privileges to the lounge and you can check in and out on the 22nd flr. to avoid long queues at the frontdesk. Breakfast buffet included with the room was excellent and had multi-national foods. Being a new facility it had the feel  smell of a new car so to speak. Everything was buff. The pool was my savior, though it wasn't long enough to actually get some laps in but it was great. I will stay there again.",January 2019,NA

BeeBee E,Jan 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,EXCELLENT,This hotel is fantastic - professional staff.  Patrick (Team Leader Concierge) - gets a huge thumbs up. All staff were polite.  The location to the Cebu city was not within walking distance but there is constant but also a MYBUS station across the road at Park Mall which will take about 15 mins for $1.30 AUD. The buffet breakfast was amazing.  Endless food.  We also had the buffet dinner for approx $23AUD per person - totally worth it. Unfortunately the pool was closed for 3 days due to water treatment cleaning but there were so many children in it all the time I guess it needed it.  (perhaps keep children under 16 out of main pool as there is also a kids pool.)  Roof top bar was fantastic.  A Bit annoying getting our bags checked (scanned) every single time you walk into the lobby - but thats just how it is everywhere in the Phillipines. Overall an excellent stay and worth the money.,December 2018,NA
Eunice S,Jan 2019,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Not the best just OKAY,"On New Year's Eve my family and I decide to celebrate by checking In at Bai Hotel. During our arrival at the hotel there was a long queue for check in and since I was was pregnant, it was inconvenient for me to stand that long so I approached one of the hotel employee whom I presumed was their  manager because she was wearing a different uniform, if I'm not mistaken her name was Rochele. So when I was approaching her she just looked at me  and walked away even though I was so sure she saw me and it was quite rude and I was very offended. Luckily the lobby ambassadres helped me unlike the manager which has left a huge impression on me. Regardless of what happened during check in the room tidy and nice, the swimming pool has a breathtaking view at night we were able to see fireworks everywhere from the pool bar during the countdown. Lastly food was great however there was still another queue for breakfast and no priority lane for pwd, pregnant woman and senior citizen which sucks.

Me fo an instance, the waitress said that the romper shorts that i wore is not allowed when in fact if you'll check inside, alot of girls are wearing super short shorts  compared to what im wearing. Implementation should be for all.üòä",December 2018,NA

We were too tired to complain so we pushed the beds to join them together. At 11.45pm we heard our doorbell. Twice. I got up and a bellman was at the door to deliver luggages! Wc are not ours! :( and the baby woke. I was so disappointed. They should make sure they have the correct room number before ringing. On the brighter side, the baby enjoyed her breakfast.

I appreciated the fact that one of their staff at the lobby assisted the customers whenever there was a queue during check-in and check-out, The rooms were clean and always kept clean. One thing that can be improved on is the software (?) they are using. It took us at almost 20 minutes to check-in since their system posted that we needed to pay for our transfers even if the document we have provided (emailed in advance by the reservations team) indicated that all were paid for. The front desk staff had to make several calls to confirm this. The same situation happened when we checked-out.

reylimchiu,Jul 2018,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Very poor customer service and endorsement system,"My friends and I stayed at Bai Hotel from June 28-30 for our post-graduate course. All in all we reserved 25 rooms for everyone. We experienced several mishaps during our stay but I‚Äôm going to cite just 2 of them (or else I will  give  a negative rating ). Four of my friends stayed at 2 connectiong rooms (room 1003-1001). They ordered room service during their stay amounting to about 1,000 plus pesos. Upon checkout, the occupants of one room went ahead of the other two- they checked out and paid the 1,000+ bill. When the remaining two occupants of the other room checked out about an hour later, they were informed that the bill was not yet paid and the other two did not check out yet. We were surprised since our friends informed us that they already checked out. The front desk insisted that no checkout was done and we have to pay for the rooms service. So we complied and were about to pay for the room service when another front desk lady arrived and said that the bill was already paid for and that our friends already checked out! How come there was very  poor endorsement, and shouldn‚Äôt that kind of stuff be centralized so every one will know?Secondly, A few  hours after checkout, I found  out that my friend  left my handcarry bag containing documents and food stuffs (chocolates, single-slice cakes) in our room. My husband called up the front desk and he was informed that yes, a bag was left  behind and that it is with the housekeeping, and we or someone else can  claim it provided there is an authorization letter. So 2 days after (July 2)a friend of mine (since I already left for Mindanao) claimed the bag with an authorization letter but she was informed that the bag was not retrieved! We were confused since the operator  said the bag was retrieved. I called them up again July 3 and asked About the bag and they said it has not been retrieved. I told them I am positive that I left  the bag in our room. But still they were adamant that no bag was retrieved. My husband then called them up again July 3) and told them that when he called up June 30, he was informed that the bag was retrieved. They said they have no record that he called up June 30! And my husband was aghast since he talked with the operator so how come there was no record of his call? When my husband told them that he can call PLDT to trace the call, they retracted their statement and said that yes they did have a record that he called last June 30 and they were informed by the housekeeping department that the bag was retrieved. ?????!!!! WTF??! They apologized and gave the excuse that there was poor endorsement from the housekeeping department. What i can surmise is that the stuff inside the bag interested them or they have already ‚Äúharvested‚Äù the contents  of the bag, hence they can not give it to us. There was too much stress from this incident and I can not believe that such service could come from this so-called high-end hotel. P.S. We have not yet claimed the bag because my friend is living in Cebu City and has to travel  to Mandaue just to retrieve the bag, and God knows how horrible the traffic is. Imagine the horror she experienced when  she tried to retrieve the bag last July2 , and she was told that there was no bag. All the traffic she went through, for nothing.Read more",June 2018,NA

We also tried the breakfast there and it was also quite good. The breakfast area was very spacious and had enough seats for all the guests that were checked-in at this huge hotel. There were a lot of elevators and I think the hotel also had a good number of parking slots. The hotel had a no tipping policy which was quite refreshing. For a big hotel, I think the hotel pools were not big enough, especially since day trippers were allowed.   The pools were not as clean as we would prefer them to be.

Check in took half an hour because they were attending to some 50 plus Korean tourists; the manager on duty had me escorted to the Executive Lounge to expedite my check in process. Phone in the room wasn't working so I couldn't order room service. A repairman came to fix it in no time. The door frame was peeling off but was glued back the next day without my having to tell them. The panel where you have multiple outlets isn't screwed tightly to the desk. It gets detached when you pull out the cable. I ended up using the outlet for the desk lamp instead which meant working under less than ideal illumination.  Minor repairs ongoing in the common area  of the 17th floor where I was staying. Sections of the 3rd floor where the ballrooms and function rooms are located are still under construction.

Elmer, the fellow who made up our room always had a smile and it was clear he enjoyed his work and his interactions with the customers.

We gave the GC, name changed accordingly and paid a deposit of 2000 for incidental fee but refundable upon checked out. So here are some things I have observed, Check in/out takes time. No bell boy/service personnel to assist your luggages.

Chris J,Jan 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice hotel but inconsistent all around,"I really wanted to like this hotel.   I have been watching construction over the past year so when it finally opened I decided to book 3 nights during part of my time in Cebu.   The location is OK.   It's near ParkMall which has some nice food choices and OK shopping.  I arrived on a rainy night and the first thing I noticed when I got out of the cab is the the area where you pull up was under 2 inches of water.   The arrival area is not raised or curved like you see at other Cebu City Hotels.   Check in went fine and was efficient and the staff was eager to please as I find everywhere in Cebu.    The lobby area is nice but a bit chopped up with part of it looking grand with high ceilings and part of it with very low ceilings bit overall nice looking.    After riding the elevator up to my floor I noticed that the hallways were not air conditioned at they were quite hot.   The rooms were nice and well appointed, however the bathroom was really cramped and didn't have an exhaust fan in it.   Breakfast was nice and expansive and almost as good as the buffet at Radisson but the service was inconsistent especially when they were busy.   The pool area of the hotel was fantastic.   Great views of Cebu and terrific service from the staff.   Maybe the highlight of the hotel.    Check out was a zoo and the process was quite long with them partially automating the process and having to pull and review a paper file for each guest.   If they are trying to compete in the higher end hotel category in Cebu with hotels like Radisson Blu and Marriott I think they still have some work to do as those are much nicer hotels.   The promo price i paid for the room was less than those hotels but more than Quest, Elizabeth, and Marco Polo which all three I found to be overall a bit better experience than Bai.   I do think Bai can be a solid hotel once they work out some of the kinks.   I likely won't return because I found the location just Ok and with the regular room prices closer to Radisson or Marriott, I think i would chose those instead.",December 2017,NA

The hotel was fully booked and there were a lot of people checking in for the holidays. It took us almost an hour waiting in line to check in. The front desk clerks were fast and efficient. All their staff were friendly and helpful with our luggage. Although we wanted to tip them, they have a strictly no tipping policy. We had our dinner at Cafe Bai. The whole restaurant is huge with a lot of food choices! Their food was sumptuous and had a variety of choices. Their waiters also were very accommodating. We didn‚Äôt have reservations for dinner that night, just walk-in, and the available table was situated at the very end of the floor coz it was full packed crowd. As in like way at the back. We talked and asked them if they could transfer us to table near the buffet and once someone was done with their dinner, they immediately transferred us. They also had carollers and singers at the lobby. I originally tried to book for a suite room but they told me it would be open in 2018 still. I also called the hotel ahead to confirm my reservation and book for a twin bed for each room i reserved but unfortunately they did not note it. Oh well, The room was clean and comfortable and had a beautiful view of the city :)Before our check out, we went to the pool. The kiddies pool was ice cold so we transferred to the adult pool with my kids. It was warm and had a nice view with Good music. Their food at the poolside also was delicious. Upon checking out, i called the concierge to help assist us with our luggage and boxes but they had a lot of people checking out too so it would be awhile before someone would be able to assist us. My sister and I decided to carry everything, the boxes, bags and paperbags by ourselves. A housekeeper in the 17th floor (wasn‚Äôt able to get her name) saw us and she offered to help us. She helped carry our stuff until the lobby where a concierge attendant helped us too. Highly recommended hotel! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª ‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏è‚úîÔ∏èRead more",December 2017,NA
Charlie Pauly,Dec 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A delightful stay in the heart of Cebu,"Our two night stay at Bai couldn‚Äôt have gone any better. From the initial entrance, to the buffet breakfast and one of the comfiest nights sleep we‚Äôve had in a long time! The staff and team were so enthusiastic throughout our stay. The room was spacious, the food delicious and the pool/rooftop view was a lovely place to unwind. If we ever find ourselves in Cebu City again we‚Äôll be heading straight back to Bai Hotel.",December 2017,NA
MsFireDesire,Dec 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Thank you Bai Hotel!,"The hotel has a good location, it is near a mall, near the port and most especially near the airport. The pool is on the roof deck 21st floor, swimming while seeing cebu city, it's cool. And their buffet restaurant is one of the best and largest in Cebu, there's a lot of cuisines to choose from, a lot of food options to fill the tummy and it's yummy. Though there are some areas that are still under construction and i understand since they just had their soft opening as mentioned by the pretty lady in blue, leona at the reception. the staffs were friendly and attentive, and to leona, thanks girl for assisting our family during our stay, from check-in to restaurant reservations to helping us in exploring more about cebu tourist spots, thank you so much and thank you bai hotel",December 2017,NA
ezra_boom,Dec 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,the NEW place to BEAT...,"My 1st experience with Bai was last October during my company's national event for 3D 2N with delegates checked-in from all over the country. It was immediately followed by another major company event this December with 220 participants. If not for the 1st experience, we would have not gone for a second. We could hardly feel they are yet on soft opening. The sound-proof rooms are all new, with an amazing harbor view. Sleep matters, and gladly enough the bed mattresses are super cozy. And surprisingly, the room is provided with an electric iron and ironing board. The hotel facilities extends from premium restaurants, to 24-hour coffee bar, and even an ATM. No need to leave the hotel premises. But the best thing about Bai will have to be it's staff, who are extremely hospitable and genuinely polite. Raymart Revillas, one of the many fine people at Bai, certainly earned my commendation, having handled all our needs exceedingly well and beyond expectations. Im a frequent traveler, and as such, constantly exposed to beach resorts, city hotels and what not. Just like me, if you are a discriminating guest, this place will overwhelm you. Definitely, will keep coming back to Bai and recommend this to my visiting guests. Im looking forward to another wonderful stay spending Christmas at Bai with my family.",October 2017,NA

Redemptorist1992,Nov 2017,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed,"IÔ∏è got 2 rooms for me and family on Nov 1,2017. First the advertise room rates were deceiving and poorly communicated. Free breakfast for 2 adults an 2 kids is absolutely not true. IÔ∏è had to pay for the 4 kids since the room only comes  with 2 free breakfast for adults. Buffet breakfast food is awful . Service was very disappointing.The pool is too small and don‚Äôt swim in the pool during day light coz you will see all the dust and pollution.Room view ( premier room)of the ocean  includes container vans and garbage view. IÔ∏è was disgusted . My room glass window was very dirty and even told front desk service. Bathroom is very small and water splatters outside the shower room Toilet amenities were scarce. Only one roll of toilet paper is provided. IÔ∏è will never recommend anyone to stay in this hotel  ever!!! IÔ∏è paid a lot for the accommodation that was not worth it.",November 2017,NA
freddielimoran,Nov 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Kudos for a great service,"We booked at Bai Hotel with my family last Nov 4-5, 2017 to celebrate my day as well as to have some bond with the family. We were handled by Mr Restie Cuenca and we were very very happy with the result of the service. He asked my birthdate on the form and the hotel greeted me with a very nice decoration on our room, gave us some fruits and a birthday cake! I really would like to commend him for the job well done for our vacation to be fantastic. I definitely love to book with Bai again and having him, Restie as our Butler.",November 2017,NA
darren4112016,Nov 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Flexibility,"Been there for an overnight  stay. Upon arrival we can feel that we are secured and can feel the staff are very welcoming. We can witness the nice gesture and greeting from them. Saw an old friend Mr. Joel Espina, Executive Housekeeper and still have the heart and passion of service when we reported that our TV and telephone is not working he immediately solved the problem. Service Staff from the Cafe was fast and efficient especially breakfast but the major set back is the kitchen staff from the egg station... I guess he is having a bad day... I ordered an omelet and instead of giving us a number for them to serve it he told me to come back and pick it up... Flexibility failure #1.. When I claimed my omelet  there's an empty catsup container and ask him if I can ask for Catsup... He told me that they don't have it but I can get it at the Asian section..Flexibility failure #2. Egg station in charge cannot refill a container of catsup.  I ask a service staff and without hesitation delivered it on time, I brought up the concern and she report it to their supervisor.  With the said concern the supervisor showed up and express her apologies... With curiosity I tried to drop by again to the egg station.. And saw that the catsup was filled. Maybe because my concern was raised. This hotel is very new and with this staff behavior it can give you a bad impression. Hope we can refresh the staff from time to time to leave the hotel with an excellent experience. That's all thank you.",November 2017,NA
ceibed,Nov 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,first impression matters,"I like it when the core people in a hotel will treat you nicely regardless of how you look. We came to check their place since its their soft opening. Comically, I wore pajamas and slippers. I was surprised that the staff including their supervisor greeted us delightfully, well for me its a plus 'coz not all the time you get that kind of treatment if you happen to look odd in a decent place. I hope they will keep that up! (no discrimination thing)The food in their cafe is good and service crew is very courteous too. It's a good thing they specifically indicate that TIPPING IS NOT ALLOWED. It gives a sincere impression to the customers. It's not that customers are happy not to give but its good that first and for most service is done without hidden charges. I will definitely recommend this place.",November 2017,NA
jet t,Nov 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Bai Hotel Cebu,"Hotel staff are corteous and friendly. Wifi is fast free and unlimitted if you are a hotel guest. Room is new, modern and clean. The infinity pool at the 21st floor has a good comanding view over the mactan chanel and the reclamation road spectacular view especially at night. The gym is decent enough and the Bai Cafe Restaurant is above average good quality choices of food and beverages. I will be back and can recommend it with friends and associates.",November 2017,NA

The hotel is so classy, staff all very accommodating and greets you every time they see you. Food is fabulous especially Uma-japanese restaurant. They have Bai Cafe which serves buffet breakfast, lunch and dinner and the food there is fantastic with various choices. our room- premier room has one very big king size bed that will fit two adults and two kids. room is big and cozy. There is a small function room in bai cafe if you want to have a party but food will be taken at the buffet area. overall- i love the hotel",October 2017,NA
