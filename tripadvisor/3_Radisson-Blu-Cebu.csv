Almost every year we visited Cebu we make sure to book here and this year we are more pleased knowing that our room are newly refurbished and we learned that they renovated already almost all floors.

TheJasonLarson,Feb 2020,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Great stay at the Radisson Blu,"Our stay was amazing! We had the best customer service from all the staff members; each person was incredibly accommodating and room service was very quick. The room very clean and we had a great view of the city. The only gripes we had were there was no fan in the bathroom to vent condensation out quickly and the position of the TV was not in front of bed, but in front of the couch in the living room area. Though, these things did not impede on much and we really enjoyed our stay. There wasn't much in way of food options for vegans at the Feria (which is a big ask), but if you ask some of the restaurant staff they will be able to make you something. We definitelu will return. Thank you to everyone who made our stay enjoyable.",February 2020,NA

Nelson H,Aug 2021,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very disappointing stay,"I stayed at this hotel everytime I visit Cebu. I uave been very happy in my past visits. Unfortunately my last visit in July 2021 was very bad. First upon reqching our assigned floor, there was a very bad odor in the corridor outside our room. I did tell the reception about it later on but the problem was never resolved. We stayed in a Junior Suite, it was clean but the towels are old and obviously worn out. This is a bit disappointing as Radisson os supposed to be a 5 star hotel. It is very noticeable that the entire hotel is extremely understaffed. One example is that ai have only seen 1 concierge personnel in our 2 days stay. When we arrived at the hotel, the security guy was also the same guy who sanitized and brought our luggage to the check-in area.Another bad experience is when I used the toilet lobby. During our first day of stay I went to the toilet lobby to pee, I noticed a bubble gum packet on top of the male urinal. The next day when I went and used the same urinal, the toilet have a very bad smell and the bubble gum packet was still there, meaning nobody cleaned the toilet!",July 2021,NA

The room we got was on the 10th floor but it did not feel like it since their elevators worked swiftly and the operators were quick on their feet! I love how the place matched the energy of its staff and crew. Clean, warm, and totally inviting. The hotel doesn't give a very intimidating feel and that's what I always look for in a hotel. They all greeted us with a smile no matter how early or late. The main highlight of our stay was the breakfast buffet! The selection was pretty decent and the staff really made dining so fun! The staff never hesitated to ask what we needed and during our 4-day stay, we made friends with the crew!

Only negative I can think of about the hotel was the outdoor area next to the pool was average. The outside bar is tucked away and the grass wasnt very nice. Aside from this hard to find faults and would definitely return in the future.",April 2023,NA

Mar R,Apr 2023,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A good hotel choice if you're with family around the city of Cebu. Clean, Warm  Inviting!","We stayed during the peak of the holy week but were still pretty well-accommodated! The room we got was on the 10th floor but it did not feel like it since their elevators worked swiftly and the operators were quick on their feet! I love how the place matched the energy of its staff and crew. Clean, warm, and totally inviting. The hotel doesn't give a very intimidating feel and that's what I always look for in a hotel. They all greeted us with a smile no matter how early or late. The main highlight of our stay was the breakfast buffet! The selection was pretty decent and the staff really made dining so fun! The staff never hesitated to ask what we needed and during our 4-day stay, we made friends with the crew! Sir Kenly and Sir Ronald made sure my family and I had a comfortable time since I was with my mother who is in her golden years.

Adonis L,Jan 2022,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice room and accommodating staff,"It was my second time staying at Radisson. During my first, I got a free upgrade to a junior suite. This time, however, wasn't the best of times owing to the recent visit of Super Typhoon Odette  but the devastation and grief that Odette had brought over Cebu was a remote feeling once I got inside the hotel. It was like an ordinary time except for the pool that was out of service and the access to SM that was closed. I had to walk in the drizzle through the long driveway just to get to SM. The check-in staff was congenial as opposed to the cold and curt check-out staff (probably because of the annoying guest who checked out ahead of me). Moreover, due to the holiday binging and boozing, my blood pressure shot up. The staff who took my BP at night was actually not the resident nurse (as the nurse was already off duty) and yet he was professional and seemed genuinely concerned about my condition. The same with the HR staff who took my BP the following morning.I will always recommend Radisson Blu to friends and family. In fact I took a video of the inside of the room to use as recommendation to my buddy here in Iloilo. We both frequent hotels here (in Iloilo) and one thing noticeable about the hotels here are the limited food choices in the buffet breakfast and the floors which are not carpeted.Read more",January 2022,NA

There is a reason why you are 5 stars. Also, room service don’t answer quickly. You have to give them a call like more than 2-3 times for them to pick up. Also, when i ordered for a snack it took them like 4 hours to give me my change. Imagine? I did not follow up because i was just observing.

Nelson H,Aug 2021,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Very disappointing stay,"I stayed at this hotel everytime I visit Cebu. I uave been very happy in my past visits. Unfortunately my last visit in July 2021 was very bad. First upon reqching our assigned floor, there was a very bad odor in the corridor outside our room. I did tell the reception about it later on but the problem was never resolved. We stayed in a Junior Suite, it was clean but the towels are old and obviously worn out. This is a bit disappointing as Radisson os supposed to be a 5 star hotel. It is very noticeable that the entire hotel is extremely understaffed. One example is that ai have only seen 1 concierge personnel in our 2 days stay. When we arrived at the hotel, the security guy was also the same guy who sanitized and brought our luggage to the check-in area.Another bad experience is when I used the toilet lobby. During our first day of stay I went to the toilet lobby to pee, I noticed a bubble gum packet on top of the male urinal. The next day when I went and used the same urinal, the toilet have a very bad smell and the bubble gum packet was still there, meaning nobody cleaned the toilet!",July 2021,NA

The bathroom was roomy. You have good internet service. However, the first day and first night of stay was quite uncomfortable because the aircon does not work very well. I thought I did wrong when adjusting the aircon but I wasn't because when I called and they sent someone to check on it does the same exact thing I did and was told that I just have to wait for it to be adjusted. I waited and it really took a long time to cool down from 24 to 18°C, I thought it's just how it works until the next morning it's still beyond 20°C so when I went down to get my food delivery I asked them to check on it and it turns out that the aircon filter needs changing. Well, the temperature went down eventually but still unhappy with it because 18°C still feels warm for me. I have stayed in a different hotel but I don't get to wake up every dawn because of the warm room temp. And the fact that the aircon doesn't have a remote since it's ""automatic"" is unlikely for me.

We stayed in connecting rooms (business suite), at the 20th floor, which had access to the business lounge. The rooms were really big with a living room and an extra half bathroom (which was very useful for a family of 6!). The view was superb! We were able to take afternoon and evening snacks with unlimited drinks from the business lounge. They even serve hard drinks and wine for free! Wow! That's what we call a great deal! The hotel was also a few steps away from SM CEBU which was very convenient.

Lia A,Dec 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A Place to Sleep,"Stayed at this hotel during an event. Stayed at the junior suite which looked like a mini condo unit sans a kitchen. Only stayed a few days so I can't comment on their executive lounge. DIdn't get to see or enjoy it. Bed in room was comfortable. Toilet and bath were clean and spacious. Concierge staff were polite. Breakfast spread was pretty good. Location of the hotel is quite convenient--just directly opposite SM Cebu. Didn't have trouble getting a Grab to and from the hotel. I need to comment, however, that being a 5-star hotel with non-smoking rooms, I was quite disappointed when I smelled cigarettes upon reaching my floor. Either that or a strong paint odour would linger, and not just on my floor. Friends who were also staying at the hotel mentioned it too. Didn't manage to report to concierge about it as I was preoccupied with an event I was to be attending. Later on I heard that there was an ongoing renovation at the hotel. Just wondering now why a reno would happen in December/the holiday period/peak season. And on a completely different note, I noticed that the rooms had a Nespresso machine. I do hope the hotel is doing their part to collect the capsules for recycling. I know Nespresso has a service for this. It's just another small effort to consider. Perhaps have a container in each room where guests can place their used capsules, so that they're easily segregated from the rest of the trash and are then ready to be sent for recycling.

Lia A,Dec 2019,4.0 of 5 bubbles,A Place to Sleep,"Stayed at this hotel during an event. Stayed at the junior suite which looked like a mini condo unit sans a kitchen.

Breakfast spread was pretty good. Location of the hotel is quite convenient--just directly opposite SM Cebu. Didn't have trouble getting a Grab to and from the hotel. I need to comment, however, that being a 5-star hotel with non-smoking rooms, I was quite disappointed when I smelled cigarettes upon reaching my floor. Either that or a strong paint odour would linger, and not just on my floor. Friends who were also staying at the hotel mentioned it too. Didn't manage to report to concierge about it as I was preoccupied with an event I was to be attending. Later on I heard that there was an ongoing renovation at the hotel. Just wondering now why a reno would happen in December/the holiday period/peak season. And on a completely different note, I noticed that the rooms had a Nespresso machine. I do hope the hotel is doing their part to collect the capsules for recycling. I know Nespresso has a service for this. It's just another small effort to consider. Perhaps have a container in each room where guests can place their used capsules, so that they're easily segregated from the rest of the trash and are then ready to be sent for recycling.

While some properties make up for these shortcomings with better services/staff, that does not seem to be the case for the Radisson Blu Cebu. There are often issues with the air conditioning in rooms, if your room is even ready despite an evening check-in. Even management was unwilling to adequately address issues with the Elite program they sell at this property. For sure do not buy this if you are a Radisson Reward member as there is little/no incremental value and they are unwilling to refund the membership.

The cheapest and most comfortable way to get to and from Mactan Airport is by using the MyBus Airport Service; air conditioned and comfortable seats for only 80 pesos per person. Its terminal is at SM City Cebu which is adjacent to Radisson Blu. You can buy everything you need [gifts and souvenirs] at SM City not to mention their multitude of dining options. Just cross the street and you're there. Radisson Blue has everything you need from a 5 star hotel: comfort, service and luxurious amenities. The ever courteous staff will go out of their way to help you. Trust me, they did us a couple of favours like making a special dish and sorting out a document courier problem. We also enjoyed working out in the gym at the basement. I overheat easily when exercising so its cool temperature was a relief. Feria Restaurant offers excellent buffet. They may not have the widest food selection in Cebu but the menu offering is tasty plus its not overcrowded like in Bai hotel. If you prefer fine dining ambience over fast food atmosphere for  buffet breakfast then Radisson Blu is for you.

When I went to get some kimchi, I already smelled something bad, but decided to get some still. Then when I ate it, that's when I confirmed that the kimchi is no longer edible and spoiled. I asked for the staff to take a look at their kimchi to prevent others from consuming it. She then went to the E chef to have it checked. To my surprise, the chef said that it is the normal smell and taste of a home-made kimchi. The chef made it appear that it is my first time to eat kimchi, and insulted my judgement on whether is is spoiled or not. I may not be a korean, but kimchi is my favorite. I have kimchi at least once a week and I can tell if it is still safe or not. I just can't accept that instead of apologizing, they made it appear that I was just someone who never had kimchi in my life. Sucks to me then. tsk!",March 2019,NA

When I checked in I was on a middle floor.  I believe the floor below was being renovated. I was visiting for business and working overnight which meant I had to sleep during the day. The sound and smells from the renovation finally got to be too much. I called the front desk and asked to be moved. ""Yes sir.

We went into the 20th floor lounge one night and my sandal strap broke and our waiter offered to fix it himself right there.  Who can ask for a better service than that.

You can have your breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktails at the 20th floor Lounge if you get the business room. This is my first time to stay at Radisson.  You enter and expansive lobby fit for a 5 star hotel. This was previously the Sheraton.  The business rooms are spacious except it didn’t look anything like the picture they displayed.  The service was very good and everyone were courteous.  I would stay again.  The drawback, the pillows are too soft that as soon as your head lays on it, all air dissipates from it and well, it like your left with nothing to support you up.  My throat would also get itchy everytime I would enter the room but will go away when I was out. So maybe the rug  needs more frequent vacuuming.  Yet, it was a comfortable stay, and quite happy of its vicinity to everything.",January 2019,NA

Elizabeth M,Jan 2019,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Really Nice Staff in Dated Property in Cebu Near Ports,"Cebu is  a lovely and vibrant city, full of nice people and fancy malls.  I was there during the holiday season, and everything sparkled and glowed. This Radisson property was probably pretty nice when first built, but needs a facelift and upgrade.  It's a bit away from the city's center, and sits over the bustling industrial ports. That means views are not good either. The room smelled kind of funny, and the carpeting needs to be replaced. the food was ok, but I was very careful about what I ordered.  The lobby is very pretty and grand, and I would have enjoyed the restaurant dining, except I was working nights, so there were almost no options for me other than room service. The staff were all lovely and very helpful, and did their best to make me comfortable, so this review is in no way a reflection on them. A huge 4"" bug of some sort (palmetto bug?) wandered across my bathroom floor and up into the ventilation system, and fortunately that happened the day I was checking out or I would have freaked out. I probably won't stay here again when in Cebu. The whole place just needs to be updated if they want to appeal to the business traveler.",November 2018,NA

Furnishings look beaten up, dirty carpets need deep cleaning/shampooing or be replaced entirely, bath towels had seen better days.  The host at the breakfast cafe would readily turned away would be diners who prefer ala carte as opposed to their breakfast buffet that does not offer a good spread.  The pool is dirty with moldy tiles and water littered with leaves all over.  I had stayed in other Radisson Blu around the world and this Radisson Blu Cebu is by far the worst.

There were no rude incidents, which has happened elsewhere.  Great location--right across from a major mall, which we went to frequently.   We also used the buffet often.  This was a little disappointing.   Food selection was good but not great.   Pancakes and waffes during breakfast were cold, but then, I experienced the same thing at the Marriott down the street a few years previous.  Pool area was nice, bed was comfortable.   One complaint was, when we entered the room, there were dried up water marks all over the counter in the bathroom and near the tv.   It came across as if the room hadn't been cleaned properly, but when I talked to the housecleaning person, he said those were stains that don't come off.  After that, it was a non-issue.

My request for microwave oven was denied even after I spoke with the manager. Staying for 12 days with 2 young children is hard without a microwave, I had to ask the operator to heat my food and sign a waiverevery time I need my food warm up.

The decor is modern and I felt the pricing reasonable (certainly by US standards) for the products and services received. The Spa was outstanding, the pool is pretty but only 4 feet deep so I did not use it more than once during my stay. I want to give a shout out to Ramon Makilan, the FB director who went out of his way to make our stay pleasant. Also, Oliver our waiter in Feria as well as Marvin and Anthony at the bar. The food is very good. I have been here for almost two weeks and I can recommend the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon (shout out to chefs Richie and Adele), the lechon wraps with chili mayo, the Sushi at SushiSake and also the garlic prawns. They serve a buffet style breakfast, themed lunch and dinner in Feria (the hotel's restaurant), but have a la carte items as well.

Stephan is a true professional in my opinion. He appreciates the hard work from the staff and shows them his appreciation. I always visit the spa in the basement for a massage each time I stay here. On my first visit, a girl by the name of Irene gave me the massage and she was incredible. I returned a second time for a massage a week later and I asked for Irene by name. She is incredible and I felt extremely good and relaxed after the massage. The service staff at the Feria restaurant were remarkable. Each time I came to the Feria, I was always greeted by beautiful girls with a smile. At no time did I ever have to wait to be seated because these girls provided an incredible service. Once inside the restaurant, the service staff were also incredible. Even though all the staff were fantastic, I would like to recognize a young waiter by the name of Kenneth that usually waited on me. This young man deserves the recognition because of his hard work and the service he provided for me and others. I would also like to recognize the Supervisor at the Feria restaurant who's name eludes me at this time. This young man is a true professional who works side by side with the service staff to ensure the level of service is consistent. I would also like to thank all the staff that work at and around the pool because these people provide a service that is seldom recognized, but their service has an important role in the success of the hotel. I was always greeted with a smile from all of the pool area staff. The pool bar staff are all fantastic. I would however like to thank the following people for their hard work. Bartenders Kenneth and Vince, service staff Lidya, Cristine, and Kenneth. (Thank you for always making me laugh Kenneth), and the pool bar Supervisor who's name eludes me. To all the staff at the pool bar, great job! There is a reason I consistently stay at Radisson every time I stay in Cebu.

The front desk office staff (Janna) was extremely professional and attentive (should be in management). Wylliam [sic] the bell boy was super nice, helpful, and fast. Even Chona (breakfast staff trainee employee) was excellent and professional in attending to our table.  The security staff at the front of the hotel with the drug sniffer dog who was super friendly were very professional.  This hotel is located adjacent to SM Mall and short taxi ride away from anything you would want to go to in Cebu City. Having stayed at many Radisson's in the USA, this one, by far, is one of the best in terms of staff and how its run.

He called every courier for me and after a long chain of redirected phone calls, he tracked down my package!!

Mike P,Mar 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,An excellent Hotel in an ever growing city in Asia.,"The Radisson Blu in Cebu is a 4 star hotel conveniently located in a bustling and crowded City. The rooms are well kept, the service excellent and the responsiveness of management to problems or issues is superb.First the staff: Service is friendly, quick and almost overwhelming. Special mention to three outstanding support staff in the fine hotel restaurant: Oliver at breakfast remembered us by name and food preferences and efficiently took care of us without neglectiing other customers. Albert and Neil were similar in their attention and seemingly appeared just when we needed something. Amazing service by these 3 especially but all in the restaurant were great. They treated us like family and we made friends.We had some difficulty with the AC and hot water in the room which engineering corrected immediately. Don’t be shy about asking for help, they are responsive and happy to help.Some advice for this hotel and others in Cebu: the room rates are less expensive if booked on line. Calling the hotel directly gets the standard rack rates which are about 25% higher than the online rates. Be sure and keep a copy of the quoted rates when making a reservation. On our way out the bill reflected the higher rates and we had to have some lengthy but helpful discussion to get this corrected. The Hotel Customer Relations Person Sol took charge of the issue and left us feeling great about our overall experience at the hotel. There are smoking and non smoking rooms and you have to be insistent if you require non smoking. The hotel buffets are top notch and the food very good. Right across the street is the SM shopping center which offers many outlets, restaurants and other services. Taxis always available except when is rains. Uber and grab work well here. They hotel has a car service to and from the hotel to the airport, a spa, gym and excellent pool. Probably one of the top 3 hotels in Cebu City.Read more",February 2018,NA

The size of hotel is super big, lot of staff. Very easy to go sm mall from the hotel barely 5min walk. Pool is of decent size but crowded always. Gym is good and big. When compared to the service we recieved at quest hotel Raddison has a long way to go. One of the incident we had during our stay is we ordered dinner at 7pm to have it delivered at 8pm to our room as my pregnant wife had medicines to take but we endup getting our food at 8:45 after several calls to the reception, its very surprising for a 5star hotel to have such lousy service. Even though they boast about 100% satisfaction guaranteed (see attached pics) if not they promised to return your money back its all a complete lie.

Czar Emmanuel,Feb 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great breakfast menu!,"Radisson Blu is definitely one of the best hotels in Cebu City. I stayed in this place for four days during an international conference we attended. We were given a wonderful room overlooking the pier. It was spacious, very modern and clean. The conference rooms were also great, with unlimited, overflowing snacks and drinks. The main lobby was impressive and the reception staff were very helpful. But the best part was the breakfast buffet. The food selection was something really to crave for! Lovely foods of international choice! The place's location was also excellent. It's located just across SM City mall. Perhaps the only thing that they need to improve is the swimming pool. It's quite small and too shallow. I think the deepest part was only 4'5"" or 5'. Practically it's only for kids. But for the rest, I couldn't ask for more. Highly recommended.",April 2017,NA

Also very happy with the hostesses at the breakfast buffet, who remembered our room numbers after only one encounter, and the elevator attendants who added a level of decorum and elegance to the very impressive lobby and to the chef who served my mother the freshest cut Mango.  Our only problem was that, after a City tour where we grabbed some lechon for a snack, the pool bar manager wanted to charge us a corking fee to sit at one of the tables in the grass (of which all 4 tables and 4 other lounge areas were empty) as if we didn’t pay a bunch of money to stay at the hotel.

The room was large, kept immaculately clean  and very comfortable. The only challenge for the hotel is the location as it is situated down by the harbor port.

The only thing you can do from the hotel is going to the mall across the street. For the rest the surroundings are really not cool.  See pictures.  The hotel is at 50 meters from a container harbor.  Two roads are separating the hotel from the harbor.  One road with a lot of traffic day and night; and the other road giving access to the container park.  Sirens of all types, horns.. Very noisy, very polluted environment.  The outside swimming pool is separated but very close to this noisy activity.  Apart from this, the building is nice with a great lobby and eating room.  My room was good-sized, clean and well maintained.  A real plus in the hotel is the personal that is extremely friendly.  The breakfast buffet is awesome.  The dinner buffet at the other side, is not bad but not so great as 85 to 90 % is always the same and when you are staying for more than a few days you are bored to see always the same stuff.  I spent 2 weeks there and it was really a nightmare to obtain a cold beer.  I don't understand the problem.

I booked an executive club room - the young ladies who worked within that area were absolutely fantastic - a compete rounded service to rival many similar styles in different parts of the world. The area itself, close to the port, is not exactly fantastic, but the facilities available within the hotel grounds are more than adequate to entice you to stay.

Mo D,Jan 2018,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Best of Both Worlds!!,"We started off our trip at this hotel and to be honest it was nice and clean, they had polite staff and it was right next to the SM Mall which was good!! Along with all the good came a few downsides which were currency exchange desk which is meant to be open 24/7 only had limited amount of money they could exchange (max £150) slight inconvenience tbf in the end just ended up walking to the mall and into a supermarket to exchange money!! The tour desk was good and helped out loads specially when we had limited amount of days we had to fit everything in ASAP. We did the canyoneering at Kawasan Falls and whale shark diving in Oslob. Our tour guides were amazing and very helpful. Only downside about one of the tours was that when they took us whale shark diving the boat they had arranged to take us out was full of perverts who acted like they had never seen a women in a bikini before. Continuously asking my girlfriend to take off her life jacket because she’s beautiful?! Did mention this to the tour guide Kevin, he was lost for words and said he would raise this with management!! Apart from the old hungry fishermen it was a half decent experience being able to swim with a whale sharks.",January 2018,NA
Louise N,Jan 2018,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Good value for money,"Spent just one night here while in transit to Manila. For being one of those big anonymous hotels, it was really quite good. It is well located near a huge shopping mall. It has a nice pool area, spa and fitness. But Best were the meals. A superb mixed Asian buffet with almost everything one could ask for. Very tasty and good quality food. Nice and friendly service, reasonable priced.The breakfast buffet was equally good and was included in the price. Only backside would be that the hotel is located right by the motorway which can be disturbing when using the pool.Read more",January 2018,NA

When we arrived on their lobby, their personnel dressed in blue polo just stared at us, we asked him since he was the only 1 standing infront of us to pls get our luggages from the back of the van but again he just stared at us not uttering a single word, so we just hauled and dragged our own bags toward the front desk to check in and complained about the behavior of their personnel, the front desk just told us that its not his job to handle our luggages since they are their security personnel not baggage handlers....the frustrations could easily died down with just one word, SORRY, but was never said.",January 2018,NA

Its restaurant Feria seemed a very popular one in Cebu, its buffet was expansive! And the staff - every single one we interacted with made us feel so welcome. The hotel even accommodated a last minute change in my plans. Its city location was convenient for commuting to the airport, city sights and the ferry to Bohol (note that its not close to a beach). Its bang next to SM City Cebu mall which was good for eating options and to spend some time at during a few scorching daysThe pool was great but its located on the ground floor next to a busy city road. I would not wish to be seated at one end of it which was right next to the road and separated only by a low wall. Having said so, this was limited to one end of the pool.

I had reserved for 3 adults, with buffet breakfast, and business lounge access.  When I asked the front desk clerk about the lounge access, she first said I did not have any.  Then she checked and confirmed it.  Next I asked about the buffet breakfast. She said my rate did not include it, and I wold have to pay extra.  I showed her my confirmation email, which explicitly mentioned buffet breakfast.  She said she said their system did not show the same info, and asked me to forward my confirmation email to her. She advised me to have continental breakfast the the lounge, because she would have to,check with reservations, which was already closed (it was 8pm). I said she would have to let me know earlythe next day, because I intended to have breakfast at the buffet, which I had paid for. When we got to the room,there was no bed for the 3rd adult.  So I called the front desk,and a bed was brought up.  However, much later that night, we discovered they had provided towels for only 2people.  Since it was late, I did not call downstairs.  The next morning, I requested the front desk that we be given a 3rd set of towels.  She noted it down.  When we came home late that evening, there was no extra towel.

Great location next to SM mall.  Outstanding lobby and courteous, friendly staff.  Clean throughout.  The rooms are staring to show their age, some loose tiles in the bathroom, hot water that gets hotter without warning (ouch), worn carpet.  The lobby/lounge area is spectacular, but if you decide to have a drink or some food there, don't be in a hurry.  The staff is friendly and courteous, but they need more instruction on how to serve their customers.  Most of the time I had to flag someone down to place an order or get the check. One last annoying item on this most recent trip.  (I've been coming here regularly for over 3 years)  Someone has decided that Fox News was no longer necessary on the cable line up.  Since it was the only channel we watched to pass the little time we stayed in the room, it makes staying here again a more difficult decision.",December 2017,NA

A6534WSmichellet,Dec 2017,1.0 of 5 bubbles,Very disappointing,"Very long check-out. Took about 30 minutes to check-in and had to email them our reservation, not sure if that's common practice.  Requested towels for a tour, plates and silverware, and replace the robe taken by housekeeping after cleaning our room. Had to call them 3 times, one call per hour, so we waited 3 hours for our requested items to come in.  We were downstairs and decided to order take out to bring back to our room. Only ordered Halo-Halo and Siomai for take out and drinks for while we wait. Ordered a blended Margarita, got a non-blended instead. Fine! Took them about an hour to get us an order because they didn't think that we were guests!! When we wanted actual silverware instead of plastic forks, they said that they can't give it because we can't take them out of the hotel. So our food wasn't a priority that's why it took so long and that's why we were treated differently because people that worked there didn't think that we were guests. Very disappointing!! You should treat all your guests/customers the same way.  We only stay in a five-star hotels for a reason and the way your hotel function is not up to par to a five-star standard.

srilagnas,Oct 2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,"Decent stay, but staff need to be more friendly","Though I appreciate people's work, even if it means to make the guests uncomfortable for a bit, there's certainly a way of doing it. At Radisson Blu, however, somehow the staff at the entrance aren't quite equipped in making their guests feel welcome, especially when they are doing a late check-in (which by default means that they are coming after a long flight or something). We had booked a car for airport pick up from the hotel, which btw was three times more expensive than normal cabs or Uber for that matter. Upon our arrival, the moment we stepped down from our car, someone came running to get our signature on some receipt making sure that we make the payment of 900 pesos while checking out. Of course, we are going to make that payment and not run away. That signing of the receipt seconds after we got off the car could have waited for some time. Then came the extensive security checking bringing in sniffer dogs and doing normal frisking procedures too. Now, while i understand they were simply doing their jobs, they could have been a bit more cordial about it. But they were rather cold and made us feel like some people who were not welcomed at all. Followed by our check-in (which went smoothly) we had our encounter with some guy at the travel desk who wasn't helpful at all and came across as ""know-it-all"" . The idea of this review isn't to scare people away from booking here, it's for the hotel to up their quality of service. There were many positives about this place too. Besides being a beautiful hotel, the Feria eating place was too good. We even had a buffet Oriental dinner one of the nights and it was totally worth the money we paid (some 900 pesos). Will I go back to this hotel again? Perhaps yes, but this time will be more prepared to deal with the staff there.",October 2017,NA

The cakes, sandwiches, scones and tarts are perfect for this set of afternoon tea that would really complement for teas. The ambiance was really great and while having our tea there’s also a live playing of saxophone that entertained us. Two thumbs up for our tea experience because one of the staff came over and we never asked him to take us a picture but he showed willingness to be our photographer at that time haha so i gave my phone and he took photos for us as our remembrance.

Bluecarrot2020,Sep 2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for business trips,"First stayed here years ago when it first opened. It is conveniently located across SM Mall and is , in fact , connected via a walkway. My room had a good view in general being on the higher floors. . Room is spacious, clean and there is a working area , which is important for business trips. You have a choice of King Sized or twin beds. Bed and pillows are comfortable. Air conditioning is great and works well. Bathroom is spacious but I am not a fan of black tiles in a hotel room. While water service is ok, managing the hot-cold balance of the shower is not easy. Maybe management can do something about this by ensuring there are clear red (hot) or blue (cold) signs on the controls. Amenities ok but don't like the scent of the shampoo, shower gel. Pls change them. The towels too are not soft to use. Breakfast buffet has lots of dishes but not so great tasting; maybe go for quality instead. A la carte food offerings proved to be better tasting. Since the hotel is right across SM Mall, however, guests have lots of choices for lunch and dinner- no need to eat in the hotel. Lobby is spacious. We did appreciate the sofas with plugs that we can use for short meetings. Staff is friendly and quite efficient. Just wondering : (1) Since this is suppose to be a 5star hotel, why do the reception guards still use sticks to check our bags? Sticks! Am sure SM /Radisson can have a more high tech way!; (2) There is a walkway connecting the hotel to the mall ; however, the roof stops a few steps just as you step into the hotel frontage. Hence, when it rains, you still get wet. Why bother to put the walkway then?

RoZeT217,Sep 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Not the worst,"We came in cebu without any luggage, so it was really nice that the mall is accessible. The staff were all nice and friendly. The food for breakfast was delicious but almost same everyday so we got used to it. The pillows we have in our room stinks ( smell like sweat), I'm too sleepy to ask for a change so I slept with no pillow. Since I asked for room clean up, I kinda expect it will be better but still stinky until our check out. I think they should not include airport transfer in their services as you really have to pay for it. Most of the hotel I went to offer the service for free. Better ride uber/ grab as it is cheaper than the one they have.Read more",August 2017,NA

gary r,Aug 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best hotel in Cebu,This is now my 3rd stay at the Radisson Blu hotel in Cebu  I intend to stay there again on my next visit to the area. The cost of the hotel is on the high side of Philippines properties but I consider it to be worth every cent  it represents very good value when you compare it to similar hotels in other countries. The property itself is of a high standard with a genuine 5 star level of service  facilities.

Checking-in and checking-out were nice, quick, and easy. Service at Feria Cafe was superb as before.  Whether it's dinner or breakfast, receptionists and waiters (esp. Mr. Oliver Paraiso) really go out of their way to give guests a pleasant dining experience - vey welcoming, alert but unobtrusive, efficient, and responsive to specific requests on food and dinks.

The seafood in its breakfast buffet are dried fish (danggit) and dried squid.,June 2017,NA

I liked this place the first time for its great location, excellent beds, and big, modern, super clean and quiet rooms. Now it's the consistent excellent service that I noticed. Checking-in and checking-out were nice, quick, and easy. Service at Feria Cafe was superb as before.  Whether it's dinner or breakfast, receptionists and waiters (esp. Mr. Oliver Paraiso) really go out of their way to give guests a pleasant dining experience - vey welcoming, alert but unobtrusive, efficient, and responsive to specific requests on food and dinks.  If you are rushing to a morning meeting, they'll pack your buffet breakfast neatly upon request. This is now my favorite hotel in Cebu.",June 2017,NA

Ram_B1969,May 2017,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Its Greatness Extends Beyond the Grandiose Lobby,"The lobby experience is something that's beyond words, although the closest description that I can get would be in my review title. Overall service is generally good so I'll say the not so good part towards the end, so that you'll read on. :) The guards at the gates who check your car are courteous, and that's good coz they establish your first impression if you're driving. The parking is quite cramped but somehow, I usually get a space every time I go there. When I went up from the parking to the lobby, I had to pass this security check but they had to ask me to wait coz they had to call the guard with the dog who was based on the main lobby entrance, to check on my luggage. I didn't really mind waiting but for some people who may be in a hurry it may possibly cause an issue. The staff are generally well trained for service but there's just this one incident when I was entering the elevator and there's this guy, most probably from the security, although he wasn't in that ""security uniform"", standing infront of the elevator doors, who, after I got into one of the elevators, asked me about my room number (????) then the door started to close... leaving me wonder why he asked. Those little things can make or break you. Just like how I loved when the ""tall guy"" who seemed to be your cafe manager really checked on the people dining, helped with the used dishes on the table, asked us if we needed anything else, etc. And when I asked for extra toiletry coz we failed to have the room cleaned, it was handed over contained in a paper bag, making it more handy. The room is neat and clean though I'm not sure if you can still do something about making it more noise proof from the sound of the vehicles down the road and the boats on the port. The window glass also needs a lot of cleaning. My son who's into photography and brought his camera really noticed it for obvious reasons. I'm not saying these things for negative reasons but for the hotel to further improve its already good status. So what else is great beyond the lobby? It's Cafe Feria at the lobby and the staff.",April 2017,NA

My son who celebrated his birthday on the night of 25th in the Feria told me that it was best birthday celebration he had so far ( probably as far as he could remember ) he was serenaded plus he got another complimentary cake the next day with Happy Birthday on it. It was indeed a memorable experience for us.. we highly recommend this place to all the families who'd want to spend quality time with each other making new memories.

If there was ever an issue the One-Touch service team would take care of it right away. They even let us do a late check out with no additional charges. The reason this was not a ""10"" in my eyes is while I stayed there for business a large convention was underway with a different company and the additional traffic onsite took out the Wi-Fi for almost a week. My room sprang 2 leaks from the ceiling in that same week, promptly fixed but still not what you are expecting in this hotel, and our driver would change regularly with the replacement not knowing where to take us and made us late for business meetings when we were already leaving 30 mins early for a 15-20 minutes drive, (normally).",February 2017,NA

Ezra C,Mar 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Rated (1-10): Answer 9,"3 years ago we checked in at marriott hotel in cebu and we heard that some of our friends checked in at radisson blu hotel we thought that the hotel they are in is a 3 star or less hotel because we are not familiar with the hotel. Now for our another convention we were given a room at Radisson Blu for 3 days and we find it very elegant and much more superior to the marriott hotel. Food is very tasty, staff are overly courteous and their swimming pool is one of a kind with an elevator that will take you back to your room without having to walk in the lobby in your swimming attire. It is also adjacent to sm mall which is very convenient if you want a last full show movie. It is really a wonderful experience.",March 2017,NA

clearwaters007,Mar 2017,5.0 of 5 bubbles,My   Fantastic  three  weeks at the Radisson Blu in Cebu,"Nothing in this review  could describe this hotel and the G.M, and his assistant G.M. Never in my life have I been treated so well. As soon as I arrived I new I had made the right choise in hotels. The guards are first class professionals. Most have  ex-military or police backgrounds, and they take their jobs seriousily. No one get by them that shouldn't be there. As you enter the hotel you step into a different world. A grand lobby, and greeted by a lovely Filipina in a formal Filipino gown who escorts you to the main receptionist. After a quick check in, you are escorted to the room of your choise. Everything is waiting for you. Bathroom full of soaps, conditioners, towels, bathrobes, extra tooth brushes anything that you may need.. A very comfortable bed , writing supplies, fast internet , large TV, room service at your fingertips. The ladies that service your room really do a good job. Fresh Fruit daily, anything extra that you might require is given to you as soon as you ask. In the morning, your breakfast awaits you, instantly anything you ask for is infront of you. A great way to start your day. If you require a taxi or information reguarding which business are recommend, all you have to do is ask. My God daughter that I was in Cebu to visit needed to see a dentist. The General Manager himself took us to his own dentist in the S.M. Mall next to the hotel. The swimming pool was spotless clean, the male and female pool attendants provided towels, blankets, drinks, anything you asked for. Would I recommend this hotel? Of course I would. I will be returning in December for a month and wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. The G.M. Is a very fine gentalman from France. When he introduced himself, he asked if there was anything that he might assist me in during my stay in Cebu. I explain to him that I was in Cebu to meet my God daughters, he immediately offered to let them swim in the pool, gave them free spa massages, and treated them as guests. He also invited my friend the superintendent of police and his wife to a grand dinner at the hotels expense.I hope this review will in a small way repay him for his kindness . He is a true gentleman, the hotel a palace, the staff treated me like royalty. I know you shall enjoy your say in Cebu if you choise the Radisson Blu.",February 2017,NA

I found our room to be quite spacious (perhaps it was because it was a corner room) and provided a great view of the harbor and swimming pool.   The amenities such as the fitness room and swimming pool areas were great, although I would have liked to have a deeper pool (the deepest area is about 5' deep), but it's ideal for kids and not so good swimmers.  The outside bar is a great place to relax and have a few.  In the evening, you can relax inside and listen to live music.  And for all you shoppers, the SM mall is right next door!

Jay Y,Jan 2017,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Nice hotel but poor service,"The hotel is nicely maintained with clean and tidy rooms.  The buffet is probably one of the best ones in the city for a hotel.  This would have been a great hotel overall if they improve their customer service and offer improved guest experience.  For my stay I encountered 2 issues which resulted in an average rating.  The first issue was that I had arranged a pickup at airport and no one was there.  Not even a representative could be found.  I had to find out own transportation.  The 2nd issue was that the Feria service was not the best.  I was there for the dinner buffet and number of guest was very limited.  Given the number of staff working they should be more focused on guest instead of chit-chatting with their colleagues.  In addition to lack of service the staff also wanted to charge me for a calamansi juice when the buffet advertises that it's free flowing sodas, juice and beer for the Monday evening buffet.  I'm okay to pay for a drink if the staff informed me upfront that the drink I ordered is not part of the buffet.  I only found out it was not part of the buffet when it was added to my bill.  At the end the staff removed the bill but this totally ruined the dinner experience.  As mentioned earlier, this is a nice hotel but with some improvements in booking details, customer experience and staff coaching this could be easily all business travelers hotel of choice.",January 2017,NA

Very good dinner buffet at Faria restaurant, the evening cocktail service at the Business Lounge is nice, gym is OK, and the pool has a perfect deck for relaxing (water temperature a bit on the cold side). Staff always greet with a smile. I was misinformed a few times by staff which caused us inconvenience. It seems there is lack of communication between internal departments.

All staffs are most friendly and accommodating to your needs. Stayed here for 5nights on a business trip. Business class room is definitely worth the extra upgrade. Rooms are very well appointed with modern spacious interiors, a good working desk + fast internet connection in room (upmost importance for business travelers). Benefits include access to the business class lounge. You can opt to have breakfast here, a nice quiet place to fuel up for the day or if you like crowds you can still go to Feria for a wider range of buffet choices. Afternoon snacks are available, not forgetting the evening unlimited cocktails and canapés- sweet. One downward point is wifi in the meeting halls are sketchy. If this is improved it will be a 5star stay. This is my first stay in the Philippines and thank you Radisson for giving me a very comfortable and pleasant experience.",November 2016,NA

PaulR20917,Nov 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Hotel made my 1st Cebu stay 5 star,"Really such a great hotel. Hard to pick apart anything really. On this trip I stayed at Radisson Blu, Henann Bohol and Plantation Bay. Definitely had the best buffet and the atmosphere is superior. Rooms were a good size. They are not resort size room. More of a business atmosphere.  Bathrooms do not have bathtubs however the showers are very large. Quiet lobby bar with nice relaxing music. Service is top quality. Hallway corridors on room levels seem to need some touchup. Have a slightly unfinished feeling. Also very important these days is the solid security. No one gets in without being scanned. Next door to SM Mall is extremely convenient. Cabs always available without the additional resort fee charged by some. Recap: Plus rooms, restaurant/food, atmosphere, luxury feel, fast service, security, workout area, proximity. Cons: really minor. No bathtubs. Hotel blocks sun from pool in early afternoon.",October 2016,NA

Tessa C,Aug 2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,The view are all container from the port,"What I like only in Radisson blu was the staff from Feria (Deparine , the waiter and their supervisor which I forgot his name) they are very good in customer service .their dinner buffet was great but fruit selection was only cheap fruits like pineapple , watermelon and melon . Which I'm looking for mango everyday at the buffet  and you can get small serving if you Ask personally the waiters .Plenty of choices and the breakfast was expensive 880 per person which was ridiculous price for breakfast. The bacon was too hard to chew , no has brown,  and no enough fruits selection to choose and the coffee was cold. First impression as soon as we went to our room was disappointing and also we book as the family ,however there was only 1 bed, having details of the kids  ages You would have thought this would have been taken in to account and the said sleeping arrangements addressed accordingly.Theirs no Bath tub(only shower for the room for 5tho pesos)which other hotels have bath tub in said price. The carpet in the hallway was too old even in the rooms, dimly lit hallway (scary to go out alone) and the paint was also old. We always wake up in the middle of the night coz our back are sweating even we adjust into cooler mode. A  mistake staying here, not money wise and the view not good at all..

Their buffet had so many choices with different themes each night - all that we tried was delicious. The morning that we checked out, I ordered fresh fruit with ""bread or toast"" expecting something light  simple to bring on our flight. I got containers of an assortment of sweet  beautiful fruit and delicious pastries that we shared. The reason I didn't give it an excellent rating is that the pool isn't very big; and it's located behind the hotel which is next to busy streets so not very peaceful even though there are tall walls  plants surrounding the pool area. Overall, our stay was exceptional, and I would definitely recommend!",July 2016,NA

Unesa M,Jul 2016,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Cebu Family Vacation,"My name is Unesa Miguel. I'm an avid traveler which means I have been to many hotels and since and I'm an World Elite Travel MasterCard member, I have access to many 5 star hotels. I travel at least 3 times a year and during summer is where my family and I travel around Asia. I checked in to Radisson Blu in Cebu on July 7-9. Since this is a 5 star hotel, an exceptional customer service is expected. Unfortunately this is not what I have experienced with Radisson Blu in Cebu. There were two poor customer service instances I had experienced with them. The first one was on July 8th where I have a scheduled tour with my family and the tour driver was picking me up at the lobby by 7am. The driver came at front of the lobby and asked for the staff at front to page me to let me know that he arrived. Instead of doing so, the staff at front sent my driver to the hotel parking lot and didn't page me at all. So here I am waiting. 20 mins passed by and I decided to call my travel agent and I was advised that my driver has been waiting. I went at the front lobby and talked to one of the staff and asked if they know anyone approached them and was looking for a guest named Unesa Miguel. They said no one has approached them. I decided to go the hotel parking lot hoping that the driver ended up waiting in there, and yet I was right. I asked the driver why he didn't ask for the staff at the lobby to page me therefore we didn't waste any time. He said he did and yet he was dismissed by the front door staff and was asked to park in the parking lot as outside transportation are not allowed to wait in front of the lobby. I talked to the duty hotel manager about this as this is not acceptable. I have wasted a valuable time where it could have been avoided if their front door staff did what they were supposed to do. For a 5 star hotel, you shouldn't be experiencing this flaw! They also said that an outside transportation is not allowed to wait in the lobby and yet while I was talking to one of the staff at the front, another outside transportation has been parked at front for quite sometime. I know this because I initially thought that was my driver. The second poor customer service experience was on July 9th. My family and I experienced this during their buffet breakfast in their restaurant called Feria. As I mentioned earlier, I'm an avid traveler. And every time I travel in Asia, not only my own family that I bring with me but also my entire family (ie siblings and their own families), which means I do pay an excessive amount of money on every hotel that we check-in. As we go in this restaurant, I can already tell that we're the ones who have a huge number of guests. We were seated. Please note once again that I traveled so much and have been to many 5 star hotels that I already know what to expect in terms of customer service. In a 5 star hotel, it is an expectation that your server will come and introduce his or herself to you, will ask for any beverages that he or she can get for you. We've been seated for 15 mins and no server has approached us. I don't think that they can't see us as we're the biggest party inside the restaurant. However I see lots of servers walking past us catering to other guests (mainly non Filipino guests). If I didn't purposely approached one of the servers, our beverages would not have been served. After a couple of hours, finally our dear server named Alan came over introduced himself. I must say that the only reason he came by was to hand me the bill because he needs my signature. Unbelievable! And that was the time that he also asked if there's anything that we need?! This made me laugh so hard! I never thought that I would write a review for a 5 star hotel for years and years that I have traveled and for so many 5 star hotels that I have been into. I was insulted! To the General Manager of Radisson Blu Cebu, I'll be happy to discuss this unpleasant experience with you and hope that this could be a training experience with your staff.

The only flaw about their service, I might say, is that their staff does not seem to really mind you if you're not a foreigner or an important-looking guest.

Johan T,May 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Another exelent stay,"3rd time returning guest and still impressed by the service and quality offered by Radisson Blu Cebu. Location and accommodation still the best in Cebu. Breakfast is a dream with enough choices to satisfy every nationality. Feria restaurant for dinner buffet is a must try. Lounge offers all day refreshments.   If will quote my previous review Entrance: The hotel entrance and lobby looks, and is impressive. (some people don't like the enormous space, but for me it's contemporary top design). We booked an executive suite and this gives you the privilege to check-in and -out at the business class lounge at the 20th floor.  Room: The suite was very spacious with separate bedroom, sitting area, bathroom and walk-in closet. The rooms are luxurious and well air conditioned, you have LED TV in your bedroom and sitting area. Nespresso coffee maker and tea is complimentary. For the products in the mini bar you will be charged. Bathroom is spacious and has bathtub(if you like...with city view in some of the rooms) and separate shower, amenities are high standard. Executive rooms have a walk-in-closet). Rooms have Wifi and ethernet cable connection, speed is fast enough for daily needs. Security: Everybody who enters to property will be checked. At the entrance all cars are screened to prevent terrorist attacks with cars and/or vans. Before entering the lobby, guests have to pass a metal detector. Thumbs up for the security part. Staff: All staff is very (not forced) friendly and they will help and accommodate you with all your needs and questions. They take your remarks/complaints very seriously and will do they utterly best to resolve all issues you have, close and personal follow up by Radisson Blu management is guaranteed.  Amenities: Swimming pool is clean and well maintained, beautiful incorporated into the garden and child friendly. During evening hours it's nice to have an after dinner cocktail at the garden cocktail bar. Fitness centre is available Wellness and spa at additional cost. Lobby bar and tea bar are luxurious and spacious, during evening hours solo and/or band artists perform live music in a discrete and non-disturbing manner. Business class: When you book your stay in Radisson Blu I recommend you go the extra mile and book a suite (business or executive suite) and take the advantage of personalized and quick check in and check out at the business class lobby situated at the 20th floor (and if you want, complemented with a drink or snack) - continental breakfast - refreshments throughout the day and excellent starters, cocktails and selection of wines before you go for dinner. Service in the business class restaurant is professional and discrete. Feria restaurant:  At ground level you can enjoy your breakfast at Asian (Japanese - traditional Filipino and Indian food), continental (excellent selection of cheeses and pastries) stations. Breakfast is included depending your reservation or can be obtained at extra cost. (recommend breakfast at Feria) Feria restaurant serves also lunch and dinner at extra cost (a la carte or buffet). The buffet has different stations offering international cuisine.  Radisson Blu is a 5 star hotel and is worth every star they earned. If you stay in Cebu and you're not at a tight budget then this hotel is the place to be.",May 2016,NA
ehrinpapa,May 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,A great place to stay in Cebu City,"The hotel's staff were very accommodating and especially considerate to the needs of my dad who uses a walker to get around. The rooms were immaculate and very comfortable. We were able to experience both the dinner and breakfast buffet. They have discounted dinner buffets on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday so it was a bit busy, but that did not detract from the excellent service we received. The breakfast buffet was included with our booking. They had a wide array of food choices for both breakfast and dinner. You also have a great view of the beautiful pool area. My only complaint would be that the wifi was slow, which might be a factor for people who are staying there for business.In addition, the drive to the airport isn't too bad. Our departure flight was scheduled at 10:30 AM on a Sunday. We left the hotel at 8:30 AM and arrived at the terminal at 9 AM.  I would definitely stay here again!",May 2016,NA

There are some things that could be improved like concierge should be more proactive in making sure that packages for guests are actually delivered to the room. I had a suit handed over to concierge but they forgot to inform me about it but anyhow they rectified by delivering the item all the way to Mactan as I already left the hotel.

Please train your staff to smile, and to give way to guests when they cross paths - it was the first time I had to give way to a hotel staff at a door.

Upon entering inside the lobby I was already amazed at how large and clean it was. Great customer service from reception staff and no delays, just straight to our room as soon as the paperwork was completed. The room was very spacious and the bed felt like floating on a cloud. Wanted to sleep but already had other plans to attend to. The bathroom was clean and all the amenities worked perfectly. Air con kept the room very cool at all times, you would forget the blistering heat outside. The pool was relaxing and had plenty of space to swim but the only thing I would say is that it wasnt deep enough. The gym is well equipped and used it most of the time. The sauna/steam room located in the locker room came in very handy after a workout to relax. A spa is also located next door to the locker area but wasnt able to try it. The most amazing thing in the hotel is the buffet at Feria. So many choices and the food tasted sooo good! I am already planning my next trip to Cebu and will definitely be staying at the Radisson Blu again. This is a place where I know I will feel safe, secure, and relaxed. Also the staff are amazing and would always make you feel welcome. They are the type that would go out of their way to please you and ensure your stay was perfect.

Just beside it is the SM Mall so you can just walk a little if you want to go shopping, dine or stroll. It's like 30-45mins away from Mactan International Airport. The hotel's lobby is so far the most spacious I've seen and looks modern. Room assigned to us is big enough, with good view of the sea port and with basic amenities you need. Hot shower is working fine as well as the water flow. Bed and pillows are comfy (with generous 5 pillows in our queen sized bed). A little glitch on the AC though, we kept on pushing the cooler button on the wall from time to time (no remote control). Breakfast buffet is also great, though there's exactly the same set in our 2-day dining. I didn't try them but I think the gym and pool are great (there were a lot of guests enjoying them when I picked). Hotel staff are okay as well, helpful and dependable.

Our room cleaner Mira was equally attentive and keeps our room clean and fresh daily. Service at lobby bar was also good though drinks and tea were pricey. Recommend having a room with seaside view, we requested for a top floor, the very professional front desk lady Ginalyn work her magic to get us room 1824, great view though some noise noted on late nights from loading of cargo around nearby port.

Breakfast in the restaurant is a disaster. First day, the table given to us was given to another guest after we returned from getting our food. Second day, food was not refilled immediately.

A lady from Feria immediately assumed and just informed my wife thay they were going to charge half the rate for children dining without checking our registration or attentively listening to how old they were. This could be done better. The manager greeted me. Another receptionist was wearing a genuinely pleasant smile. One waiter who served me hot choco also did the same. I requested Lowella to set the table for two additional guests. Oliver offered me coffee but I asked for water instead. I informed a waiter that I needed to check if our visitors arrived but ended up cancelling because my sister and her husband were already full, to which, the cashier assured me that they only punch if the person has actually dined.

Mimi M,Apr 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Why do they always give us a Smoking Room?,"I loved Radisson Blu the minute I entered the lobby but I was disappointed when they gave me a Smoking room even if I requested for a Non- Smoking room at the Front Desk because of my Asthma. The room reeked of cigarette smoke when I entered my room so I lost no time in informing the front desk staff  for a change of room lest I get an asthma attack. Do people at the Front Desk really give you a smoking room and a room at the farthest end of the hallway or on the 13th/14th floor in exchange for the discount you get just because you booked through the different hotel  booking partners of TripAdvisor? Then if you noticed that it was a Smoking room  complain, you  can tell that they are lying through their teeth when they say its not a smoking floor   immediately do some damage control to make it up to you. Well, at least they changed my room and good thing too that I didnot develop an asthma attack. Well, I appreciate other hotels who treat you the same way even if you booked any other way, after all, you paid for that room too like the others.",April 2016,NA

A S,Apr 2016,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Relaxing and reviving,"Our main purpose was relaxation and spa treatments prior to returning home after 2 weeks on more remote island. Our 2 hour massage on first night was spoilt by room being right beside an outdoor event with loud music. It was disappointing that spa staff were not more aware of this event and made a better choice as to which to use, as it appeared others were available. We chose to try other spa services rather than return, until the final day when i chose a mud wrap. This was an amazing treatment with Edith that pretty much made up for our previous experience. We stayed in a business club room and found the club accommodating and comfortable. The food and beverages offered were varied sufficiently, meant we could snack through the day amongst other activities, although no sparkling wine was available 😩 We found it easy to get around from here, although chose to make own arrangements for taxi/car as hotel places premium on services (eg  private car to airport was 600php but 1500php through hotel.)

I also like the wide breakfast buffet spread, though need to improve more on offering vegetarian dish options. the breakfast at Feria is one of the best in the country, I specifically like the fresh smoothies and the chocolate batirol. As for the rooms, its very decent and and cozy.  I got one room with the magnificent view on the swimming pool side, it offers great sunrise view and vantage point of the cebu port.

However, the check in process is extremely slow (as is check out).  We arrived around 12.30pm and was told room wasn't ready yet (twin room, non smoking).  Fair enough would wait.  Arrived back at 2.30pm (30 mins after check in time starts) to be told that a twin room was available, but it was in the smoking section (which we didn't want). It took about another 20 minutes for what we did request (weeks earlier booked online) a twin room, non smoking to be available.  A lot of needless standing around and waiting in hotel foyer.  Actual check in process painfully slow, as was check out process.   This is something the hotel really needs to address. Apart from waiting maybe 5-10 minutes at check in and check out to get to a counter to get served, the actual process takes just as long, with no real apology or explanation from the staff as to why so slow.  In comparison, we stayed at another similarly rated hotel in Singapore, where was served at counter pretty much immediately and whole process took no more than one or two minutes.  So this was very disappointing and I hope the hotel improves on this.   Great location next to SM Mall though.

The corner room we were given had panoramic windows, but don't get excited about the (docklands) view.My issue that let this hotel down is on a late check in (22:30) after unpacking and settling in we found the safe didn't work, it would not lock. I couldn't face the turmoil of calling someone at 23:00. Consequently all valuables had to be kept on person and taken to breakfast while they fixed the safe. I don't think it is petty to expect a fully working safe on all occasions, surely the maid would check this between lets.That apart all other comments on these pages are accurate and it is a good place to stop over, not too sure it would stand the test of 2-3 days even with a shopping mall next door.

The second day we still noticed that all the water coming out of the faucet was still color yellow so we reported it again, this time we stayed to make sure they will take action on it. The engineer let all the water coming from the faucet for more than an hour, we are on vacation, and since we need to go out, we left them still checking the water, upon coming back at night, the water was still yellow. It was our last day on the hotel that the water finally cleared. It was really really disappointing, because first, we had to use that water for showering etc, second the actions of their hotel staff was not quick, upon our check out, there was no one to apologized for what happened, as if nothing happened.

My experience was excellent. I was upgraded upon arrival (I arrived looking quite terrible after an overnight flight and my backpacker bag so I was surprised to get this) and was taken to my beautiful room. The room was spacious and clean. The staff was simply the best of anywhere I have been. The location of the hotel is good, but you are in the city and it definitely doesn't have too much going on. I am not the biggest fan of big hotel chains when I travel, but this was definitely the most pleasant experience at any I have had.

Genevie G,Feb 2016,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Disappointed!!!,"A bit disappointed because this is a five star hotel. We stayed for 4days 3 nights, booked a business class room n was upgraded to an executive suite, upon checking in we noticed that the water coming out of the bathtub was color yellow, we reported it to a hotel staff n was told they will check on it. The second day we still noticed that all the water coming out of the faucet was still color yellow so we reported it again, this time we stayed to make sure they will take action on it. The engineer let all the water coming from the faucet for more than an hour, we are on vacation, and since we need to go out, we left them still checking the water, upon coming back at night, the water was still yellow. It was our last day on the hotel that the water finally cleared. It was really really disappointing, because first, we had to use that water for showering etc, second the actions of their hotel staff was not quick, upon our check out, there was no one to apologized for what happened, as if nothing happened. And this was supposed to be a five star hotel. A customer service business. If that is what they do to their guests, then what is the main goal of this hotel? Isnt supposed to be customer satisfaction? I guess not.",January 2016,NA

104malcolmm,Jan 2016,5.0 of 5 bubbles,We're Blue for the Radisson Blu!,"Myself, my wife and our 9 year old son experienced this hotel. We have been to Cebu many times. Prior to this, our most recent, we stayed one night at Radisson Blu in 2014 and didn't really get the opportunity to enjoy what was on offer. Only one morning was needed however to enjoy breakfast at Feria. The breakfast buffet made an instant and lasting impression on us which made us realize we had to come back and try again....just to make sure we were right the first time. I will keep this as short as I can so people reading the review can get the idea without having to read too much because I could certainly write many paragraphs about this hotel. This stay was a 6 day stay, we wanted to indulge in what would be for us a lengthy hotel stay. From the moment we walked into the hotel's massive marble foyer complete with bar, live harp playing and friendly staff greetings we had the feeling a correct decision was made to stay there. We arrived about 2 hours before the scheduled check in at 2pm and had booked only the bottom of the range Superior room. Even so we were encouraged to attempt checking in and to our delight there seemed little effort in finding us a room there and then - first big tick! Since we had spent a few nights in other hotels beforehand we were well acquainted with the size, layout and feel of other ""comparative"" rooms. When we entered our room on the 10th floor we all immediately noticed the larger size difference of the room and the bathroom compared to other hotels. No, we weren't upgraded this was the basic Superior - another tick! From that moment on we settled in for what was equally the most enjoyable stay we have ever had at any hotel. However when we factored in the cost that we were comparing our other most enjoyable hotel stay to (Marina Bay Sands Grand Club Room) the value for money puts Radisson Blu at the top of the list for sure. The included buffet breakfast deserves it's own review. This is without a doubt the biggest and best selection of foods you could imagine. The choices range from Filipino dishes, Indian, Japanese, Western style (American/Australian), cakes, breads, cheeses, cereals ect ect. But not just the huge selection, it's the way the place is run. There is no skimping! Buffet breakfast finished at 10am but no, the bacon dish is still pilled up! Sure, if you don't get the breakfast included in your room price it works out a little expensive...around PhP1000 including taxes. Having said that roughly AUD$30 isn't over priced if not for the experience alone. The service is amazing and friendly as you come to expect from Filipino's. A special mention here to Al, Alex and Brian for looking after us and doing a great job. Feria also offers lunch and Dinner buffets. Keep your eye on the promotions in the fast elevator for various food and bar deals! We used the pool and gym both of which are more than adequate for a relaxing stay. The pool max depth is about 3-4ft from memory. It also has a Jacuzzi and separate infants pool. Food and beverages can be ordered and served by the pool.  Our room was on the Sergio Osmeña Boulevard which gives views of Mactan and the harbor area. The road gets pretty busy in the morning so some traffic noise could be heard although it wasn't something that caused lack of sleep. Possibly the opposite end of the hotel facing the pool would be a quieter option with views of Mactan and the mountains. We had a family member come and stay a night with us and for and extra charge of about 1/3 of the original room price they provided a roll away bed and buffet breakfast. Thus we had 3 adults and 1 child in the room which is the maximum for this room type. Once again, this was no problem at all for the hotel staff to organize. Check out was easy and late at 12 noon so there's no rush to get out. You still have plenty of time to have breakfast, go to the gym or swim. That's a luxury not always offered by much more expensive hotels. All these little things that some hotels could make irritating were simply non existent at the Radisson Blu.  Summary: Room was big, clean, comfy.  LCD TV Cold refrigerator Big bathroom/shower Fast complimentary WiFi  Nice gym with plenty of equipment Nice relaxing pool area Unbelievable breakfast buffet Super friendly staff Earlier check in and later check out than most Covered walking distance to huge SM mall 30 min from airport and not far from City center Fast elevator   Hope this helps someone make up their mind :)",January 2016,NA

The second trip re-confirmed my assessment.   I was trying to book the presidentil suite the first time but I had to settle for an Executive De Luxe Suite. On thois trip, the presidential suite and the executive de luxe were also not available, so I booked an executive suite. It was spacious and nice, too. The hotel staff also immediately brought in an extra bed for my daughter.  We had noche buena in the room via room service. The FB manager gave us complimentary wine and a fruit tray, completely unexpected.   The next day, I booked a hotel car to take us out of town to carcar and Sibonga to see the magnificent church in Simala. Driver Jun Prado was A-1. A defensive driver, he took us on a leisurely ride up Busay from Balamban on our way back.   Overall, the hotel staff are professional and friendly.

UMe4Ever,Dec 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Excellent Hotel,"I've stayed in a Radisson hotel in the US and I wasn't much impressed of the hotel so I didn't expect much of the Radisson Blu in Cebu. But I was in for a surprise. The moment we got to the entrance, I was impressed that all guests are required to go through the security check, just like at an airport, and there's a K9 which also helps in checking the guests' luggages.I've never experienced such thing in any hotels I've been to in the US so I was quite impressed of the added security measure. Checking in was a breeze and when we were going to our room, we were surprised to find out too that we have to use our room card key to operate the elevator, which means more security since only the hotel guests has the card key. The room is very spacious as well as the bathroom. We had a good view of Cebu port from our room; but the downside of it is that we can hear the vehicles' running on the street below and it woke us up earlier than we would have liked, especially when we heard the honking of the drivers and in the Philippines, honking is common. The breakfast buffet in Feria is the best I've ever had thus far! Guests have plenty of choices, there are Korean, Indian, Chinese, American and Filipino cuisines and an abundant supply of fruits. Kenneth Lacnu is very attentive to us and when he noticed that I love mangoes, he kept bringing plates of mangoes to our table and on our last day of stay there, there was no mango among the fruits on display but Kenneth saw us and he brought a plate filled with so much mangoes. His customer service is truly excellent! He convinced us to try the hotel's homemade vanilla ice cream, of which my husband and I agreed it tastes like our favorite Haagen-Dazs ice cream. It was that good! :) All the hotel staff were very polite and courteous. And from now on, this will be our hotel of choice in Cebu.Read more",December 2015,NA

Also the SM mall next door is very crowded with no real restaurant options other than a huge and overcrowded food court, and nothing else to go to in the area (port). Bring trousers along if you choose the executive floor... otherwise you wasted your money. Casual not allowed and strictly applied (when challenged, the answer is this rule is imposed by the Radison Blu Group).

It may have specially prepared been for the conference I was there for, but if so, kudos to the chefs for pulling it off so well.

Air-conditioning unit was not working properly and made the room much to cold.  Engineering attempted to fix it, on my last stay there, but within 24 hours the room temperature went to 29 degrees C, which made for an very uncomfortable night.

Joonee Y,Aug 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Comfort and Location,"It was my first time to stay at Radisson Blu Hotel to attend a convention. The hotel is located behind SM City Cebu and the Cebu Port Authority. I was impressed by the hotel's very spacious lobby. The check-in was a breeze. My room was at the 14th floor with card type security key. It is a big room with a king sized bed with as many as 7 pillows. It has an executive desk, small ref, TV with Sky Cable, free WiFi and a standard vault. The bathroom is also spacious without a bathtub with the usual hot and cold water. Hotel staff are courteous and speaks fluent English. Breakfast at the Feria Restaurant is great. The dining hall is big and the food selection is also great ranging from native Cebu (dangit), Indian, Chinese and Western foods. Getting a taxi was not a problem. The hotel will make it sure that the taxi will not con you, the hotel staff will get the name and license plate of the taxi so that you may write a feedback or complaint if you were treated unfairly. The hotel is a stones throw away from SM City where you can look for native restaurants. It's also near Ayala Mall. The hotel is also near recommended ""lechon"" stores (Ayer's, CnT, Rico's, Tatang's). The only drawback was since the hotel is near the Port area, large trucks and trailers are nearby and may cause traffic. But hey it's almost traffic everywhere. Generally it was a very pleasant stay and relaxing stay.",August 2015,NA

Rain, mud, cramped buses and rugged food had worn us out, so we checked into the Radisson Blu in Cebu City for two nights. From the moment we were shown our rooms to the time we checked out it was a recharge for our batteries - we reviewed it on our blog here: http://double-barrelledtravel.com/review-radisson-blu-cebu-city-philippines/. The rooms are modern, quiet, clean and comfortable. The gym is excellent and has a sauna (big tick for me), the pool's great and there's even a tea bar in the lobby as well as a cocktail lounge. The best thing is the restaurant - the breakfast buffet is amazing and dinner covers everything from Indian, Chinese, Japanese and western dishes to a heaving dessert section.

The staff were accommodating even to your most trivial needs. Internet is a major plus for this hotel as you have access to reliable connection at almost every portion of the hotel.",June 2015,NA

Joji B,Jul 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Check me In!,"It was a short visit to the city but I would have wanted to stay longer if it was possible!  See, I love Cebu and being there and staying in Readisson Blu was a bonus. Big bedroom with its own office table and great access to internet. Business folks would really appreciate this. Big bed and nice smelling bed sheets with lots of pillows! I could have stayed in the room the whole day! Breakfast buffet ... well they have a huge selection one can pick from, but I guess if you stay there for a week you would want to eat out, because by then you would have tried everything in the menu. However,  next time I am in Cebu and can afford the hotel price, I would try their amenities.And yes, the hotel lobby is enormous! Liked the big space....",June 2015,NA

What I do recall is how friendly and attentive the staff were during the entire stay.  Everybody had a helpful personality--no exceptions.  There were no rude incidents, which has happened elsewhere.  Great location--right across from a major mall, which we went to frequently.   We also used the buffet often.  This was a little disappointing.   Food selection was good but not great.   Pancakes and waffes during breakfast were cold, but then, I experienced the same thing at the Marriott down the street a few years previous.  Pool area was nice, bed was comfortable.   One complaint was, when we entered the room, there were dried up water marks all over the counter in the bathroom and near the tv.   It came across as if the room hadn't been cleaned properly, but when I talked to the housecleaning person, he said those were stains that don't come off.  After that, it was a non-issue.  No noise problems from the street below.   Bed was comfortable.  A good stay all-around!",April 2018,NA

Stayed for 12 days in the executive suite and I would say my stay was ok. I have to pay P25 every time I make an outside call. My request for microwave oven was denied even after I spoke with the manager. Staying for 12 days with 2 young children is hard without a microwave, I had to ask the operator to heat my food and sign a waiverevery time I need my food warm up.

A very nice hotel with smiling staff and a beautiful lobby with amazing breakfast and super wifi. The pool area is exciting. And also it's situated aside SM cebu the biggest mall.

The experience was fun since we really enjoy their swimming pool it was very peaceful, solemn and private. The staffs were very friendly accommodating and approachable. It was a good and satisfying stay. One thing I notice is the prices on the menu for lunch and dinner is more expensive, but you can walk across the streets or take a jeepney going to the malls.",November 2014,NA
Jonathan054,Jun 2015,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Amazing,"Arrived at hotel with my wife, 2 children, and My wife's sister and 4 children who we had flown in from Mindanao. We arrived from the US and had a late flight from Hong Kong. I had reserved and paid for 2 separate rooms close together on lower floors. When we arrived by Hotel shuttle, the front desk gentleman apologized and said he could not get our rooms next to each other, and would it be okay if he upgraded us to executive suites next to each other on the 16th floor, at no extra charge. Wow, of course I said in my best hesitant voice and expression, okay, we can do that. Unbelievable rooms!!! Staff and rooms and food buffet was impeccable and deserving of 5 stars. Only problem we had was some communication problem or lack of experience problem by a couple staff members in paying for dinner buffet, as I gave them my major bank debit card (visa logo) and was told I could not use it as it was not regular cc. Funny, I paid for rooms with it just fine, and breakfast buffet next morning with it with no problem. But, it was okay as I had cash for dinner. Both dinner and breakfast buffet although a tad on the expensive side was well worth it, as the food was excellent and selection also excellent. Staff overall amazing and hotel and rooms also excellent, although I did miss having a microwave in room for my childs bottles and my hot tea and coffee to relax with. You won't be disappointed with this hotel. I fully recommend staying here if you have the chance.",May 2015,NA

The deluxe room I had was big (bigger than any other hotel in its class in Cebu I believe) with the most comfortable and relaxing bed (firm, not fluffy) and set of pillows. The huge landscaped garden and adjacent swimming pool give you the feeling you are in a resort hotel. The food at the main restaurant (Feria) was good, the service even better. Servers were visible, smiling, sensitive, responsive, and efficient on every request. Tried to order a la carte for lunch and the waiter (named Clint) offered their ""half buffet"" for P690.00 net. Value for money indeed. Buffet breakfast was superb. Great experience overall.",May 2015,NA

Not an impressive spread in terms of taste, it could use some improvement in that area. The pool area is just okay as well, I like however the way it is laid out so it seems that you have some privacy at times. The rooms are sizable and quite comfortable. The card key did not work the last time though but they were quick to assist us and resolve the minor issue.

So when the bar is already high, and everything meets the bar... it's difficult to get a surprise towards the higher end - but I got one. The food was quite amazing. It was buffet style, and like many hotels in the Philippines, they have to appeal to both Asian travelers (of several types), and westerners... They did that... and more. I have to say... it is not often you find the desserts are something really extraordinary... but the prospect of handmade ice cream every day, and all the other custom style sweet things they had there were... amazing. So, you will find it difficult to go very wrong here. Also, just to mention... the SM mall is next door, so there is other shopping and entertainment there, including an IMAX theater.

The services from staffs reflects the managements commitment in selecting, training  taking care of its staffs well being. This naturally flows towards customers well being. Indirectly I was much happier paying for the facilities  services provided, albeit not costing anymore than other similar hotel charges. Kudos to the management.  Its the human touch of welcomes, greetings, offers, suggestions and ""friendly small-talk"" that's attractive.   I've yet to be approached by a hotel staff taking -initiative- to offer me soup from buffet while waiting for my ala-carte orders to be ready in the peak time!

Todd K,Feb 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Make A Huge Impression On ""Whoever""!","My first trick to Radisson Blu is to show up for check-in as close to when first check-in begins (2 pm) as possible. I started with mine 10 minutes early and it paid off with a complimentary room upgrade, which put me in a very good mood! The room I had up at almost the top of the building was truly spectacular in its structure. The fact that the t.v. was not as large as advertised and the cablevision not offering the Gold package with many vital networks was a crying shame and almost criminal. However, if you can look beyond the t.v. offerings, the restroom shower was stupendous and the views over Cebu are to die for! Their breakfast buffet is top-notch. We visited on Valentine's Day weekend and walked right into a special event buffet that Saturday night. I was unaware of the need for a reservation, but the restaurant operations lady was able to save the meal from being a disaster and turned it into a scrumptous tour-de-force! As any place is bound to be, there were a few items which could be improved, but the number of those is much small than most of the competition. The price may be a little steep for some people's budgets, but this place is more for that really big time out on the town kinda place. I guess maybe once or twice a year on some big occasion would be a good idea for going to Radisson Blu. You will surely be satisfied!",February 2015,NA

The facilities are nice, the pool, the restaurant, the lobby and the hotel in general.  We had a mix up with our room, which soured the stay slightly but not enough to cause annoyance. The main complaint we had about the hotel was the room. It was dirty on arrival, window smudges from the inside (not clean marks, but grime) and nail clippings on the floor, all of which were still there the next day after the rooms were re-cleaned.  The staff were very friendly and accommodating. We went with two little girls, and the staff were very nice to them. The hotel has a large swimming pool and a small area for little kids which is ideal. The food was good.

My fiance was disappointed with the US Prime Rib, when the manager asked him about it, he politely told him about his disappointment and to do it better the next time. As a consolation, we ended up getting a platter filled with fruits. Oh well, there's always a room for improvement, we didn't let it ruined our night.

As a consolation, we ended up getting a platter filled with fruits. Oh well, there's always a room for improvement, we didn't let it ruined our night.

kiyeran,Jan 2015,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Rough start, but got better","My family and I booked two rooms for 6 nights during the holiday season. We had a rough start -- on the first night, we got in at 3 am, all tired and sleepy, to see that they booked two rooms with both king size beds. I told them we had three people and needed two twins for one of the rooms in advance, but they failed to accommodate that. So, we were separated - one room on fourth floor and the other on sixth floor. Although the next day, they moved us to the same floor, it still wasn't a connecting room and it was still a bit far from one another. However, the staffs and everyone was wonderful. The breakfast was great. I can really sense that the manager is doing a good job because everyone was professional. Even though the wifi never worked in my room, which is very very frustrating, the staffs came multiple times to try to fix it. In the end, I got annoyed so I just stopped bothering to call them. But just the fact that they were willing to change the whole connection told me that they really wanted their guests to have a good stay.",December 2014,NA

Daniel R,Nov 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"A Short, Yet Worthwhile Stay","We booked this hotel while passing through Cebu in route for Bohol. Because the timeframe was during our honeymoon, we wanted something classy and romantic, but also comfortable and convenient. This hotel provided all of the above and more. It is conveniently located within a short taxi ride to any of the ferry piers for transit to outlying islands, while also being close to a nearby mall for additional food options. We arrived late in the evening, so we chose to dine in at Feria (the restaurant inside the hotel). Although the buffet looked amazing, it felt like the food had been sitting out for hours without being switched out or eaten (simply not enough people). We instead ordered ala-carte and were NOT disappointed. The ceasar salad and a chicken/pumpkin curry were an excellent combination, at a reasonable rate (PHP $600 including tax and service charge). Dinner also came with fresh, hot bread which was a nice bonus. Plus, the service during the meal was fantastic, very courteous, kind, and helpful.   The standard room was a spacious, including an overly large king size bed, along with a large bathroom area. We slept well and felt deeply rested. The noise from busy roads outside is a non-issue.   Overall great experience, especially Feria, the service, and the comfy bed. We will stay again in the future when we return to Cebu for further holidays.",November 2014,NA

Graeme L,Oct 2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Great hotel, friendly staff","Overall excellent as far as the hotel itself is concerned. Food served at Feria was good in general, particularly their breakfasts, though on their lunch and dinner buffet offerings, certain items such as grilled pork, chicken, roast chicken and lechon was very dry and not hot in the least. But apart from that, the service from the waitstaff was very good, particularly from Jevon, who took care of my every wish for my entire 7 day stay there. He's a real asset to the establishment.The swimming area was another sore point. Although a very nice area, swimming there had me choking from fumes of cars and trucks rumbling by outside. No wonder I hardly saw anyone there! Another gripe I had was a tour recommended by the tourist desk in the hotel. The dismal tour I went on was a tour to the island of Bohol. They said it would be eight hours, but they never mentioned that the painful ferry ride takes 2 hours each way. What a total nightmare! The tour bus was old, it had no windshield wipers although it was raining quite heavily, not to mention that the aircon was very bad and the louvres to direct the airflow were broken. Advertised was lunch on a ""floating restaurant"" on the Loboc river. What a fiasco! A rickety craft with cheap and nasty, dry, tasteless food and a pathetic toilet in the back that you had to flush with a bucket of water.The next day I suffered diarrhoea, which meant that I couldn't attend a friend's wedding that I had flown all the way from Taiwan to attend!  And it stank to high heaven! TO make matters worse, other tour members were allowed to smoke onboard the ramshackle vessel making it highly unpleasant for us nonsmokers!  Apparently, Radisson promises 100% satisfaction or you don't pay. Not the case. I was only offered a 50% discount.  However, overall, it was a great stay in the hotel itself and I'd recommend the hotel to others, but the tour to Bohol left a very bad taste in my mouth!",October 2014,NA

Eugene III C,Oct 2014,3.0 of 5 bubbles,unforgettable experience in radisson,"The hotel should change the old furniture with new ones.  Wears are already very evident.  The carpets in the hallway and even the bedrooms are old and dirty.  As an experience, the key card keeps on failing.  There was a time when i had to go down to the front desk to have it activated 4 times at a time (same day).  We also had an event booked in the hotel last sept. 17 for the reception of my brother's wedding. The hotel coordinator assigned to the event failed miserably. There was no coordination in the activities on the event.  Most of the waiters were just standing there and seem like mere spectators of the reception.  The champagne was not served on cue.  Most of the foods were not served at all, especially to the principal sponsor tables and the groom and bride's family tables.  All we got from them were excuses and finger pointing.  They even cited that most of the waiters on the event that time were just on-calls and had very minimal experience on event services.  We can't believe our ears that a hotel of this caliber would have that kind of people working for them.  The apologies (mostly excuses) and more finger pointing were not at all easing especially that such an event can only happen once.  Frankly, we picked this hotel from a shortlist for the reception of the wedding because of their prestigious background and name.  It saddened us that we have paid a hefty price to get a crappy service.  With this, I and my family would not be able to utter good words for this hotel to our relatives and friends all over the Philippines and even abroad (in fact, most of the guests were from abroad).",September 2014,NA

It is better to move Osurobu and Mactan Island, Cebu City, such as the might may be utilized in the middle and base. It will arrive in about 20 minutes by taxi from the airport.

I need to request for room service to provide me some stuff I need during my stay.. like toothbrush kit, slippers..small things that your staff can do it perfectly on all your guest. But I appreciate the immediate response of your staff.  3. I was very surprised during my checkout when my deposit using my credit card was not cancelled immediately, and your front desk staff told me nothing about it not until I clarified it, or ask for cancellation receipt but she can't provide me.  she also told me that the person in charge will take 30 mins to do the cancellation.

The hotel amenities matched the hotel's star category.  Gym had new equipment, pool was clean and beautiful, and lobby was perfect for meetings.  The mall beside the hotel was convenient for shopping and dining.  The only constructive criticism about this hotel is the room service breakfast.

niyeew,Aug 2014,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Raddison Blu - The Hotel with the best location in Cebu,"I was transferred from Shangri-La to Raddison Blu hotel after my IRONMAN race. I was staying at Shangri-La because it was the race venue andI do not have a choice. It was fantastic hotel but compared to Raddison Blu, I'll definitely prefer the latter. Now my review about Raddison Blu. It is at the heart of the city where you are in the middle of all the shopping centers. The hotel is exactly beside the biggest shopping mall in CEBU called the SM. ( I do not know what SM stands for..ermm ) It is also a stone throw away from one of the famous restaurant called the ""Lit_Chong"" or something like that. Western,Eastern,Filippino and Chinese food and cafes, you name it, you have it at SM. You can also travel to another shopping mall called the Ayala. From Ayala, you can take a cab to Mango street, the place where all the night spots are situated. It is about 15 minutes from Raddison if there's no traffic jam.Next, the hotel condition. It is a very clean and high-class hotel. You need an access card to take the lift. So, the security is very much in place. Wifi and computer access are available. The hotel staffs are all very well trained and they wore uniforms. The hotel staffs are very friendly - they were the ones who suggested to me on where to go around at Cebu. The food and places to visit. You can ask them! They are all very helpful and friendly. ( and beautiful too! ) In summary, book your stay at Raddison hotel!Read more",August 2014,NA

I thought it would never get any better until we got to the breakfast buffet the next morning.  The food selection was superb!  Most of all the location is best in cebu.  I mean there are other hotels near the other big mall in cebu but Radisson is better..  Aster our stay here it left a very good impression to us that everytime we travel our first choice is always Radisson Blu then second is Park Inn Hotel (they come from the same company).  Ever since then we have stayed at Radisson Blud in Zurich, Rome, Chicago and Park Inn in Prague..I would recommend this hotel to evryone.

The hotel is about 20 to 30 min drive from the airport. Traffic is not that heavy. Ample security is in place upon entering the hotel compound located in a reclaimed infront of a seaport. What strikes the most is the super high ceiling of the lobby area. It gives a grandeur ambiance. Hotel staff are very welcoming and accommodating. They suggest options and offer current hotel promos. A dedicated hotel staff is assigned in the elevator to assist and greet you all the time. The rooms are clean with cable TV, free wifi, telephone, ref, slippers, bath robes, safe, free bottled water, etc. Basic toilet amenities like towels, shampoo, soap, etc. are provided. The single king size bed is really big, it can accommodate 3 pax. The twin beds are for single occupancy. The hotel have a nice pool. Pool layout definitely favors kids. The added bonus are, its beside a big mall, near famous lechon restaurants, tourist destination area of sto nino shrine, magellans cross, etc. Lastly, so far, base on my experiences, this is the hotel with the most friendliest staffs.

Breakfast pastries,coffee, cheeses and eggs cooked to our choice was also served in the lobby for the times that we decided to have a light breakfast. The deluxe room size was big enough for a family of 4. The king bed was comfortable but I just wished the extra bed came as complimentary if requested. The hotel is also located across SM mall.

I didn't check-in to the hotel but I came for the so called 50%off Buffet last Tuesday if I'm not mistaken. When I arrived at the lobby I was welcomed with a very warm greeting by the wonderful staff at the concierge and they pointed me to the Feria restaurant. It was an amazing experience because I was able to get a seat even though it was jam packed. I expected a little bit more variety of cheeses and salads though like in J Park Island Resort (formerly Imperial Palace) but none the less it was superb. The staff at the Feria was very attentive it felt like I really paid my moneys worth with a little going the extra mile from them. I then had a small chat with this very lovely staff in a blue gown she was very attentive. I really wish I knew her name so I can tell you guys she's really a doll when you need any assistance on hotel info. This asian looking concierge also was very quick at getting me a taxi it just feels like they are always looking out for guest's needs.

Although the rooms are on the small side, the resort like pool and the property's proximity to the mall would make it a hit with families. The business class room was rather small but this room type comes with access to the lounge for breakfast and happy hour. Price wise, the amount paid was relatively fair considering everything. The reason I only gave it four stars was that although they did everything well, nothing really stood out that would have elevated our stay from above average to exceptional.",May 2014,NA
teptep1,Jun 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The best hotel in Cebu!!,We supposed to stay in Movenpick for two nights but after seeing the hotel and how friendly the staff was we opted to stay here instead and we didn't get disappointed at all. The pool was magnificent my kids enjoyed the pool over the room haha because it was not deep for them really suitable for kids. The room was clean and well maintained. At first we were given a room at the 16th floor but my kids felt dizzy during the elevator ride so I asked the front desk staff LenLen if she can move us to another room and she did in the 5th floor. A short elevator ride made a huge difference for both my son. The buffet in Feria had a great selection of foods you can choose from. The staff was courteous to our needs. I really enjoyed my stay here and Radison Blu is the best hotel in Cebu definitely worth every penny.,May 2014,NA

We have noticed that every visit and stay that we make, there are undoubtedly several impressive improvements as well. As we always booked the Business Suite room with a free access to the Business lounge for cocktails and whole day drinks and little snacks, we are always happy with the kindness and friendliness of the staffs. Since we are known as consistent guests, the behavior of the staffs never change but even improved esp. at the Business Lounge area. The Lounge offers several assortments of drinks alcohol and non alcoholic. Very nice pica- pica as well and very good service. The huge Feria dining hall should not be missed. They offer massive selection of gastronomic breakfast which are even fit for lunch already. Very good service as well friendly and not too pushy. The pool bar is really nice for chillin' out in the evening for more bottle/s of wine or any drinks and food, especially if you want to continue drinking and you think the night is still young after the cocktails offered by the Lounge from 6pm.8pm. Huge area for children to run around in their well manicured garden while parents are having a great time drinking and chatting . Its really a nice hotel for family.

Dana A,Apr 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Will stay here again,"My husband and I stayed here on for two nights. A month ago, I contacted the reservations because I was undecided whether I should book two nights or one. Richard from reservations gave me a good deal so I booked two. We arrived on March 23rd at 11pm in Cebu airport. The airport pick up service I asked for was waiting for us and was very professional. The check in was fast and seamless. Our room was clean with good toiletries. The bed was comfortable. Our window had a view of the pier where we were going to the following day for our Bohol trip. I was so glad we were able to take a good shower and a few hours of sleep before we head for the pier at 5:30 am. Our room included the buffet breakfast that day only but we opted to get it via room service since we were leaving at 5:30 am. We got the Filipino breakfast. It was ok. I wish there was more coffee though. Upon returning from our Bohol day trip that night, we discovered that across the hotel, was a big SM mall where we can get dinner, money changer and supplies. That was a big plus. The following morning we had breakfast across the street at Bo's and had a big cup of delicious coffee. If we ever come back to Cebu, we're staying here again.",March 2014,NA

Pool and gym wide opening hours. Mall is 10m away, pathway with guards, very safe. Electric sockets take all kind of plugs. Enough sockets for laptop and charging things, no need to decide between TV, lamp or charging if you know what I mean. :)What they could improve: Amenities are suitable for men only, all smelled like aftershave. Pool is very noisy due to 8 lane road by fence, water is shallow, pool area too dark at nights. Breakfast is very standard, missing all the lovely local food and fruits. You practically need to beg them to get a glass of fresh fruit juice, even then half the time they came back with one from a bottle hoping you don't notice. Why? Get a juicer out on the table permanently. Fee to use the ATM in-house was a ripoff, so was the hotel taxi.",March 2014,NA
BucketLister101,Mar 2014,2.0 of 5 bubbles,Plumbing mishap,"Stayed there for 2 nights and it was rather disappointing compared to all other hotel brands of Rezidor we've stayed at in the past. We had 2 concerns. First was the breakfast inclusion. In their other hotels, we normally have to request them to include bfast on our rate due to booking restrictions. Their reception staff is usually delighted to give us an upgrade but in Cebu, the girl (after ringing the reservations) simply informed us to do just proceed to the resto in the morning and have it charged to our room. It was odd but we agreed anyway.Second was the plumbing. When we got back into our room, we already noticed that the sink had some unusual dirt but ignored it. My partner was taking a shower when I heard some disturbing noise which I thought was coming from the hallway. After a few moment, i heard some screaming so i hurried to the bathroom. The metal stopper was already on the floor. Dirt was all over the place and despite of our shouting, the plumber didn't seem to hear us so i quickly rang the operator. Apparently, the plumber was trying to fix the toilet next door. They had to ask housekeeping to clean the bathroom and replace all linens. The room attendant took ages to come and probably an hour to resolve everything. But that was it. We missed our dinner and we never heard from anybody. We didn't complain to anyone and we weren't expecting anything but it just shows that nobody cared.",November 2013,NA

We wouldn't waste our time doing it again. The staff were very helpful arranging a car and driver for us but the traffic is horrible and the level of poverty is almost unimaginable. What we found though was the people of the Philippines seem to always be smiling in spite of the conditions of the housing, the traffic and unemployment.  Anyway, back to the review, the hotel is right next to a shopping mall so you can get pretty much any western food you're looking for as well as some of the local favorites and the hotel restaurant has a very ice brunch.",February 2014,NA

I am director of  a small hotel and there is a 25 to 30 per cent commission to be paid by hotels on internet bookings through the travel websites. It makes no sense that they would not encourage the front desk to accept the guest reservation and at least give them the same rate that is advertised on the internet. Indeed, I would even give guests a 5  per cent discount on the travel website internet rate to encourage them to do so.  The front desk agent, not her fault, did not have authorization to do so.

Shawn K,Jan 2014,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Disability Travel to Cebu,"I needed to type this review to just let anybody who has a physical disability and is thinking about traveling to Cebu that this hotel is the best and only place to stay in Cebu Philippines. I am unable to walk and need help from another person for different needs throughout my day and stayed at this hotel from Nov25/13 to Dec11/13. I stayed in an accessible room where I was able to drive directly into the shower with my scooter and shower my self. The room was large and spacious for mobility chairs. The bed was very large (king size) and I could easily park my scooter beside the bed. The entire hotel is made accessible for the physically disabled. Example: If you request the hotel wheelchair, you can sit in it and wheel directly into the large swimming pool until you reach the deep-end (there are no stairs to get into the pool), then have someone wheel you out. Access to the amazing buffet restaurant, gym, lounges (inside or outside) and lobby are perfect. I also have to mention that right accross the street is a 4 floor shopping mall (MS Mall) which has any need you may require for your stay. (check it out on Google) But the one thing that made my long stay the most comfortable, ""THE HOTEL STAFF"". They were all so friendly, professional, trusting and accomidating. I had several needs and requests from the hotel and staff while I was there and they helped everytime.

In the end we decided to stay the last two days in the Radisson Blu and did not regret it. The hotel has the same level as the resorts in Mactan at the fraction of the cost, but does not have a beach, only a nice pool. It is conveniently placed just across the SM Mall with lots of restaurants a movie theater (tickets for 200 peso), shops and a supermarket which makes it convenient for last-minute shopping for cheap clothes, alcohol and other local goods to take home. But there is not much around the hotel otherwise. The only disappointment was that we had paid extra for the club floor to have a bit of luxury and the room did not even have a bathtub to bathe the kids.",December 2013,NA

The pool is huge and very relaxing to sit around and the poolside bar is great value particularly between 5 and 7 when it's happy hours. The breakfast is the biggest spread that you have ever seen with everything you could ever want for breakfast and is good quality. It is however overpriced in my opinion for a breakfast and a cheaper more basic option would have done for us.The location of the hotel next to the huge SM mall is great and it is very easy to get meter taxis here. The other good point about its location is the ferry terminal for Bohol is literally across the road maybe a 5 minute walk although because of our luggage we got a taxi which took 2 minutes.

The hotel is situated right across from a mall so shopping was nearby and other food options were available in the mall.  You will have to go through a scanner to enter the hotel for each entry and you are also scanned with a wand or lightly patted down at the mall.

I was in my room and within a short period heard the evacuation announcement from the PA system. While I was evacuating I saw staff members were helping and guiding the guests towards the evacuation area.  What impressed me is that during a crisis situation of this magnitude staff members were calm and doing their duties professionally. In the evacuation area every guests were given waters and towels – a perfect example of service delivery in details even in a crisis situation. At a later stage we were taken to the swimming pool area and I was surprised to see staff started rolling out tables, chairs, food, water, slippers etc for the guests.

JohnandAl,Aug 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best Hotel in Cebu,"A very grand hotel located close to the ferry terminal (convenient for us as we were going to Tagbilaran the next morning). Warmly welcomed by all staff who were extremely hospitable. The hotel is located right next door to SM Megamall - restaurants and shopping galore! Hotel facilities were exceptional - pool, gym and spa. Breakfast wasn't included in our stay rate but it was only PHP800 for a full buffet breakfast. Highly recommend this hotel.",August 2013,NA

The rooms are very spacious (stayed in a deluxe) and the wifi works very well in the room, lobby, and even close to the hotel in front garden, very conveniently located next to a massive mall (SM).Will highly recommend this hotel to any businessman visiting Cebu for a comfortable stay.",August 2013,NA
mba a,Aug 2013,5.0 of 5 bubbles,highly recommended,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Radisson.  The rooms were a good size. There's plenty of space for a small family. The bathrooms were huge too but are now showing signs of wear and tear. The room came with excellent amenities. The staff offered outstanding service, nothing too bothersome for them. We spent hours relaxing in the pool as the kids loved it. This hotel sits right beside the SM mall so the location is very good. Aside from that though,there is not much to do in the vicinity. The buffet breakfast was outstanding. We had our fill of smoked salmon, all kinds of pastries, cereals, cheeses, omelet and the usual fare of bacon, sausages, etc...Well done Radisson Blu!",June 2013,NA
Man R,Aug 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Trouble Free at a Price,"I stayed for two weeks in July, family of four, two adults and two kids. I emailed the hotel in Cebu directly to set up the reservation, but the rates were basically the same as I saw on Agoda. I like the personal contact and not going through a third party. Joana was very helpful and we also set up an airport pickup using their ""Coaster"" which is a small bus with plenty of room for our 13 suitcases. The only problem setting up a room there was that I needed TWO rooms. They either offer two twin beds, or a King bed, even in the suite. So this does not work well for 4 people. If they were two Queens it would work better. Anyway I got two adjoining rooms, one king and one twin. And as usual in the Philippines, family visitors always want to stay over anyway, so you need extra space. Total for 2 rooms was $300 per night with four buffet breakfasts. The hotel was clean and everything worked, as you would expect of a newer hotel. A great Breakfast Buffet was included with the room rate, and I would HIGHLY recommend that, as separately it is very expensive at 800 peso for adult. Of course one reason I chose this hotel is that you can just walk across the street to the mall (they have a crossing guard and a roof) so you can eat there anytime (although they only open at 10am) and there is a grocery store there to avoid high minibar drink prices. Laundry is great but expensive at about $3 per item. Our rooms viewed the south, so city view and some harbor and mountains also. I bought binoculars at the Hahn store so I could check out everything. The hotel pool, was very nice and quite romantic at night. Guests technically are not allowed but they never ask. My wife used the spa, massage was good but nail service was poor. The hotel van and driver rental through Hertz is double what you will pay from a local company. I found one through a relative and cebuclassifieds.com. Overall the hotel is a great choice if you have the money.

The lobby, ambience, food, and service remain good. But what does one go to a hotel for - sleep, right? My husband and I had a long day and were looking forward to a good night's sleep at midnight when we found hair (two kinds!) on the bedsheet. Thirty minutes and an adrenaline surge later, the sheets were changed - but I could no longer sleep, thus missed the following day's early appointments. The hotel staff were very embarassed and apologetic, of course, and tried to make up for it.  But it really  escapes me how black hair on supposedly fresh white sheets could be missed. Wouldn't you wonder what else they miss cleaning? This has got to be my weirdest hotel experience - it beats sleeping on a hard mattress on a cold night in an Egyptian desert. Radisson Blu is surely no longer top of mind Cebu hotel for me.",June 2013,NA

hav4wannatravel,Jun 2013,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Very good business hotel, can still be great","I stayed overnight on business and was given a corner room. The room was big and spotless with all the standard amenities complete. I got back from a function at about 10pm after a long, tiring day and requested an extra bed so that I could get a massage in-room as I prefer not to leave my king bed oily/greasy after a massage or have the masseuse stepping all over it. My only beef was that the extra bed took a while to be delivered and I had to explain at some length to reception that I needed it for the massage and no, I wasn't having anyone over. The other small hitch was the call to the spa at which I was told that my options were only either Swedish OR Shiatsu, but not a combination massage as I was requesting. I simply asked the spa receptionist to put me through to a therapist for me to explain what I needed and surely the therapist did say that they do combination massage. This just tells me that they need more training of the spa personnel. When the massage finally came, after about half an hour of mild aggravation between the rollaway bed and the spa receptionist issues, it was frankly just okay. I was expecting a little better considering the price they charge which is high for Cebu standards (I've had better massages in Cebu at half the price). In sum, for a business hotel, considering that the massage was the only amenity I was able to enjoy (I didn't have time to use the pool or gym), I would hope they could up their game and improve that particular service. Everything else about my stay was fairly satisfactory from check-in to check-out. I did also quite enjoy their breakfast buffet which was a generous spread. The lobby was also huge and impressive. I would stay here again but my massage experience keeps me from giving them full marks.",June 2013,NA

But took them up to about  530- 540pm to finally released it after several follow-ups. Upon released, the lady who checked us in called and apologized and asked How we were.. If we needed anything which actually made us feel okey already though we were pissed off earlier  caused by the delay. Since normally  hotel policy for a late check-out  until 6pm is charge half or sometimes full by other hotel and our second room was given to us at past 5pm already.. Still didn't complain anymore or haggle for a discount. But what totally pisses me and my husband off was the call of the ""DUTY MANAGER"".... I thought she called to apologize pr ask how our stay is.. but to my shocked she said that we were being complaint because of some foot steps/ jump noise underneath our room. She was able to call to tell me the complain but never mention a thing about the inconvenience they caused earlier. I have accepted the complaint but totally disappointed with how your DM handles a situation.. I myself is also a hotelier. I have worked with several chain and 5 Star hotel, Manila Hotel and Ascott to name a few.. And we also spend our week-end at Metro Manila 5Star hotels and this is our first time to have an awful experience with a so called 5STAR Hotel... It's our first time and first day in this Hotel but would like to leave the same day already..",May 2013,NA

Anilegna,Apr 2013,3.0 of 5 bubbles,Good for a short stay.  Front desk staff needs training,"Stayed here for two layovers, in between my flights to Siargao.  Rooms were ok facing the ports.  My first stay was for three hours.  Second stay was for six hours.  The hotel is right next door to SM mall, 15 min to Olio, a really good restaurant at Crossroad mall and 1300 php round trip by hotel car.  Also about 15-20 min to Anzani- another good restaurant.  This is a perfectly fine hotel for short stays I didn't want to spend more $ at Shang or Abaca.  Only issue was that front desk staff are pretty clueless. Ie I gave the front desk lady my passport and amex to check in, then asked the staff next to her to book Olio and Anzani for me.  5 min later she was still holding onto my card and did not check me in.  While checking out the front desk staff did not know about my hotel car charge of php1300. I had to tell her for it to be charged. She also asked me about my second room.  And I had to tell her she is probably looking at the room I stayed in four nights ago.In sum, ok for a short cheap stay.Read more",March 2013,NA

We stayed on a recommendation of a friend who lives in Cebu. It's a little far from the airport but it's a cheap taxi ride away. The nearby area isn't ideal but the SM mall is attached to the hotel so that's a plus. We did a lot of walking around at night and we never had any problems. The hotel property is gorgeous. Period. There's a pool, an outdoor bar and restaurant, a spa (we had a great couples hot stone massage), a gym. The rooms are wonderful and the staff couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. Plus the lobby bar with the band and the breakfast buffet (surcharge but worth it) was outrageous. Definitely stay here again.",August 2012,NA

We booked this hotel as most of the finer hotels were booked for the busy holiday season. This is a first class 6 star hotel! We have stayed in many hotels around the world and we can tell you first hand this property is very special. The service, attentiveness to details and cleanliness was incredible. We checked in (23 seconds) and Mae greeted us with a smile, professionalism and courteousness like we never seen before. We checked out in 14 seconds. Incredible again with Mae. All the staff were incredibly warm and hospitable from the lift elevator attendants (very special and always with a smile) to the baggage assistants and security guards. The food was fantastic (both buffet and business lounge) and whilst we visiting other luxury hotels nothing compared. We loved it and highly recommend it.

I slept very well. It has a surprisingly nice gym. It's next to a mall which has many dining opportunities - though it's not next to anything else.

They said Radisson in the U.S. is not as pretty as the one in Cebu. They even told their daughter about this when they called her. They love the pool while I enjoyed the gym and the steam bath was just perfect. My schedule was hectic then but I'm still relaxed and happy about their feedback.

JasA58,Sep 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Epitome of Service and Elegance,"When we first walked in through the front doors of the Radisson Blu, the word ""wow"" came to everyone's lips.  The spacious entrance to the hotel was breathtaking.  There were elegantly dressed hotel staff at every door with smiles and grace.  This was everything that one could expect from the top hotel in Cebu.  At every turn there was perfection:  Perfectly manicured grounds; fully equipped gym, relaxing pool with bar, a calming spa, and an incredible restaurant.  If ever there was a need, the staff was there to assist in any way that they could.  Even the location was great.  It was right downtown and next to one of the largest malls that we had ever seen.  Now, having said this, the hotel is reasonably new, so there were some shortcomings: the spa was actively hiring a pedicurist, the wireless was a little temperamental, and the buffet was still improving.  But these were minor inconveniences.Expense wise, this is one of the most expensive hotels in the Philippines.  But on a world scale and with all of the luxuries that you get, the cost is quite cheap.  But, ""cheap"" is what you expect in the Philippines.  Also, compared to some of the other hotels that you can get in the Philippines, this is well worth the price.",July 2012,NA

The shops and restaurants in SM city are cheap and very very good. If you can wait after 10am to eat go to SM city as its much cheaper to eat there. We had breakfast once at the hotel and I could not fault the variety or quality of food. Its not a place where if you are european would feel comfortable walking the streets the shopping centres are safe and good. If you want to arrange a day tour the hotel is very expensive.

We eventually decided on Radisson Blu - and how fortunate we were that we did!The lobby is sprawling and beautiful; the rooms reminded me of Mandarin Oriental Singapore in terms of furniture and design (the Mandarin Grand room in particular for our room); they gave lots of complementary water (in cool bottles by the way); the breakfast buffet was really good with a sprawling selection (though Mandarin Singapore and Baiyoke Sky Bangkok's were better, I felt); the drinks at the bar in the lobby were great; and the hotel was accessible.",March 2012,NA

roughingit,Jul 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Indulgent (and friendly!) oasis in the Queen City of the Philippines,"Very much enjoyed my 3-night stay at the Radisson Blu (though full disclosure - I probably wouldn't have splurged on it if I hadn't been receiving a 50,000+ Gold Point bonus through a Carlson Club offer). That said, it rose to the expectations of a 5-star hotel in all respects. Room decor was sharp, clean, and felt new; grounds including pool-front were spotless with a glamorous feel. The staff in particular, left a wonderful and warm impression. They seemed to enjoy their work and were eager to please. And the lobby/grounds were well-staffed, with a lady stationed at the elevator bank and another man at the doorway to the pool. That made the difference, to me. Room service tacked on not 1 not 2 but 3 taxes (if you add my tip, it's 4) but what can you do? Guess the Filipino government could use it. My only ""beef"" was the breakfast buffet, which could've use a bit more pizzazz for a swank place like this. Another slight drawback is the location/view; my room look out on a sprawling parking lot with a shipping harbor and cargo cranes beyond that. But well, it's Cebu City, so that's to be expected.

jetlagtours,Jul 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"First class all the way, highly recommend.","I really enjoyed my stay at the Radisson. Firstly, upon arrival you realise you have chosen excellent accomodation and are in for a wonderful stay. Most of the staff are very friendly and the setting, decor and rooms are fantastic. The rooms are bigger than normal, lavishly equipped and spotlessly clean. The restaurant, lobby, reception, bar etc. are world class. Being located next door to SM Mall means you only have to walk about 150 metres to one of Cebu's top 2 malls with fantastic shopping and dining at bargain prices. This will save money also on having to get Taxis to the shopping centres. The only thing that marred an otherwise perfect stay was when I took some guests with me to the pool area ( which is fantastic by the way). I invited 4 of my wife's family members for a swim in the pool, but was met with a barrage of questions as to who they were and was told I would have to pay P500 ($12AUD/US) per guest for them to swim there. As I had 2 rooms booked there at the hotel with my friend, they eventually allowed me to let my guests enter the pool but they were not allowed to use a towel and the staff actually checked with my travel companion if he actually knew me and would he mind if 2 of my guests could use his room number. Then my guests were constantly watched and followed around the pool area by staff until we left 20 minutes later in disgust. You would have thought I had just dragged complete strangers off the street for a swim by the way we were treated. This was very embarassing to me and my Guests, their treatment was quite shameful and totally unbecomming of what is expected of a 5-star Hotel. Otherwise I can't speak highly enough of this Hotel and would definitely stay again.",June 2012,NA

The amenities were amazing, they had a nice swimming pool (although the pool may seem bigger in photos and maximum depth of the pool was about 4 or 5 ft) and a gym with complete facilities and instructor. Inside the room, we had a total of 3 TVs and the sofa were very cozy (you can even sleep in the sofas and still feel comfortable). There was also a Nespresso machine (which unfortunately I was not able to try) and complimentary mineral water.    We had a LAN connection in our room and the internet was reliable. The bathroom was clean and spacious. The only thing that I was not used to  was that the on/off lever of the shower was across the shower. They also provided ASIRA bathroom amenities which I can say were quality products (they smelled really good). There were also sockets for all kinds of plugs. The bed was very comfortable and a very relaxing sleep. They even had magazines and books about Cebu so you can check the places you could visit or food to try out. The breakfast buffet was pretty delicious. They had a wide selection of food choices ranging from rice and breakfast viands to yogurt and fruits. Their pistachio ice cream is a must try! It was very delicious!",April 2012,NA
HelFi,Apr 2012,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The best city hotel we have stayed,"We stayed at the Radisson Blu for 3 nights and had a wonderful stay. It is more expensive than Parklane where I have stayed 2 times, but this hotel has a higher standard and higher service level. The staff makes you feel welcome and are very service oriented. The fact that SM City is one stair down and just cross the street was for my ""shopping crazy teenage daughters"" a big advantage. It was also a docking for my Iphone in the room. The best city hotel I have visited.",April 2012,NA
Flyprowlers,Apr 2012,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great for families,"We stayed at the Radisson Blu for 5 days 4 nights and had a wonderful stay. During our trip planning, we had considered the Marriott near Ayala mall b/c it had been highly recommended by family and friends. However, I couldn't turn down the rate at the Radisson - saved almost $250 for our stay compared to the Marriott. In retrospect, it was a great choice. The Radisson's lobby is much more expanse than the Marriott, which gave our 15-month toddler plenty of space to walk w/o running into anything or anyone. Plus, the Radisson's pool was much larger - another plus for families. Rooms were spacious and clean. We liked the sliding doors w/in the room, which allowed our daughter to sleep in a ""separate"" room while we watched TV. Also, the Feria restaurant's buffet was just AWESOME! I miss my Filipino breakfasts so much! Service was good. Although, we had to remember we were on ""island"" time b/c things just took a little longer than we were used to. So if you're think going to be hungry while sitting at the pool, you'd better order now b/c it's going to take around 30 mins for a burger - just sayin'.  Loved being next to SM Mall too. Plenty of decent restaurant there. The hotel concierge also arranged transportation for us to the Imperial Palace, where we spent approx $30 per person to use the pools and beach there (a must!). The 30 min cab ride was maybe $16 tops. Overall, great hotel w/ good amenities in a decent location for a good price. Very satisfied. Would definitely go again!",March 2012,NA

Check in was a little too long as they couldnt find our booking but staff were pleasant and efficient in every other aspect. Room was business-like cool and had a great bird's eye view of the whole city. Beds were amazing. The location of the hotel was also excellent as it was sort of connected to the huge SM City shopping centre. Nice little touches like discount coupons for SM City and their hotel bar were also provided at check in. Breakfast was an amazing spread. They even had ice cream and waffles for breakfast!!!

K_travel_freak,Aug 2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,"Lovely hotel, eat elsewhere.","We stayed here for a night last June with my 2-year old. We stayed in a business suite which was very spacious! There is a Nespresso machine in the room and 2 flat screen TVs. The bed was very comfortable and I had a very nice sleep in it. I love the shower area because the water drained quickly and we didn't encounter any problem with water running to other places in the bathroom. This may sound trivial but I have stayed in a number of hotels that cannot get this right. It is very irritating having to stop showering just so the water can drain out first. Location-wise, the hotel is ideal for mall junkies as it is beside the biggest mall in Cebu. It is also near the pier --- good for those who might be going off to other islands, but it doesn't really give you a nice view. As to the breakfast, eat somewhere else. The food choices are mainly catered to Filipino taste. Vegetarians and health buffs will die here. What I love though is that they use reusable bottles for the juices and jams are in big jars instead of single-serve packs/bottles. It took forever for our eggs to arrive from the egg station even if there were just about 4-5 tables occupied. The restaurant staff were unfriendly and we could hear some of them grumbling. There are also others (restaurant staff) who do not have any interest in the guests and pretend not to see you, let alone assist you.Check-in and especially the check-out were swift and the reception staff  (esp. the male one -- sorry, I forgot his name) was very good!",June 2011,NA

The Radisson is close to the pier and besides the SM Mall in Cebu City. It's lobby is well designed and beautiful. Rooms are your standard business class types. They were kind enough to upgrade us for free to the Business Class Superior room since we stayed there for about 2 weeks. But the room was not completely well thoughtout configuration wise, if you want to watch TV from the bed it is almost next to impossible because the TV is in the other sectioned off room. I wish hotel chains would actually spend more time getting a sense of how usable a room is. Maybe sleep in one for a night or two. It'll give you valuable information on what needs to change. I like the fact it was beside the SM Mall because many dinning and shopping options. Being close to the pier was helpful for us because we could go get on a ship and island hop. Like we did to Bohol.

I was at first thrilled as my friend told me something negative about the hotel but at the moment i checked in...i immediately felt service from the heart that up to this moment i cannot forget their names such as Macy from the reception, Miguel and Joyce who were a little hesitant to give me the email address of their front office manager(thinking that i would complain) but just to send a small note of thank you for a very warm service we received.  The bellmen who were so alert to offer assistance , Aikko and Carlo you guys were just awesome! Mom was so impressed with your ""two hand service"", the genuine smile makes a big difference.  As a training manager in 5 star hotel in Dubai, the service i had received is now always a part of my training sessions as an example.

kielwin,Jun 2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Best City Hotel in Cebu,"Radisson Blu has been my favorite city hotel in Cebu during my frequent visits to the Philippine's oldest city lately. It is just right next to the gigantic mall, SM City Cebu, whose owner also owns the hotel. If the Ayala Center Mall has Marriott adjacent to it, then SM City Cebu has Radisson. Although I prefer Ayala Center to SM, I would still choose Radisson over Marriott. I have also stayed a few times in Marriott and it pales in comparison to Radisson's grand lobby, pool, spa and of course great food. I have one complaint during one of my stays in the hotel and it was related to making up the room. The previous night I had an in-room massage using my own exotic oil so the next day I really requested my room to be made up. The night I came back to my room it still smelled of the massage oil as the beddings were not changed. I furiously relayed my disappointment to the housekeeping. Anyway I think this was a one-off experience as I previously has in-room massages before in this hotel and the next day my room was free of the oil smell.Hotel Feature Tip : If you are a fan of breakfast buffets then I suggest to have your room rate includes breakfast for two or more persons staying. It is 50% cheaper that way than being charged separately. Also request for rooms that have no doors to the adjacent rooms for a little more private conversations. If you are a fish lover and prefers in-room meal, don't fail to order the deep fried lapu-lapu.",June 2011,NA

There's a free wi-fi access and computers in the hotel which was convenient since we didn't bring our laptop. Food was ok and pricey...good thing there's plenty of choices and there's always the mall LITERALLY a stone's throw away!  The housekeeping was great...a little too great actually, because they organized my clutter, which I personally find it weird, and put my new pair of glasses INSIDE the night stand drawer (which I NEVER DO for fear of forgetting it) and yup, I end up forgetting it. Thank goodness housekeeping kept it safe when I called and a friend was able to pick it up for me. Another MINOR problem is if you are a light sleeper, I suggest for a room on the higher floors...even when we were on the 7th floor we could hear music from downstairs. We could also hear people talking from the other room but not loud enough that it bothered us that much. The super comfy bed, pillows, and blanket made up for it!!!I didn't give it a 5 star because I am coming back and I had a slight change of plans and I have to see if they are able to follow through with what they promised. They seemed very accommodating in the email but we will see if they keep their word when I get there two weeks from now. I will definitely write a review after my 2nd visit!!!",April 2011,NA
PhilippineTrekker,Jun 2011,4.0 of 5 bubbles,Great Facilities  Central Location,"Went to Cebu to attend a conference and tried Radisson for a change since it was new. I found the facilities great. The room was sparkling clean, bed was comfortable, the AC was just right.  I like the modern bathroom, the gym was vast and the atmosphere in the coffee shop was pleasant. I had a opportunity to order a midnight dinner and the service was efficient and friendly. The laundry was also done fresh and timely.The only downside was that the food quality was only average. Because of the great facilities and service, I also had big expectations on the food - alas, I was sadly disappointed. I ended up eating out instead in the many wonderful restaurants Cebu is known for. Overall, I would stay there again because the service and facilities exceeded my expectations, the location is great if you have a car - very central -  then I can still eat out and enjoy.Read more",June 2011,NA
DokGrey,Mar 2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The Best in CEBU,"I would say the best hotel in Cebu. I have nothing but praises in this hotel. from the lobby, to the hotel room, bed ,pillows, staff, food, pool, facilities, security, cleanliness,everything is perfect. The only thing i didnt quite like is its proximity to the pier area. It is quite an eye sore in the beautiful facade of the hotel. Other than that i am convince that this is the best hotel in cebu and probably the 2nd best hotel in the philippines. Still my personal choice is Sofital Manila...But its a different story. I just hope Raddison will maintain this kind of standard considering its only about 4 month old.      Definitely i am going back to this hotel",February 2011,NA
fitchick711,Feb 2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The BEST hotel to stay when in Cebu!,"My family was in Cebu over the Sinulog Festival this year and we were originally booked at The Marriott but after checking out this hotel after our first night in Cebu I just had to check-out at The Marriott and stay at the Radisson Blu instead. The facilities are way better, newer and much cheaper, especially if you get the local rate. Huge and elegant lobby, professional staff, awesome pool and the gym was outstanding - huge with plenty of new machines/equipment. Right next door to SM mall, excellent views from hotel rooms and free fast internet throughout the hotel. Overall, I find this hotel a real value for money and I look forward to staying here again on my next visit to Cebu.",January 2011,NA
Magentatravel,Feb 2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,"Amazing value, 5 star experience",This is a great hotel in a convenient location next to SM mall that has everything. Breakfasts are  wonderful and the spa is a glorious experience.I am booking my clients here.,January 2011,NA
Duge,Jan 2011,5.0 of 5 bubbles,The best hotel in Cebu City,"We stayed at the Radisson twice during January and on both occasions were very happy wih the service and the hospitality extended to us by all staff. Our most recent experience was during the Sinulog weekend and the program that the hotel provided was simply the best experience I've had at any Sinulog over the past 8 years. Yes, it's a little more expensive than say Marriott or Marco Polo but for the extra few dollars it's worth it. The breakfast is better than Marriott and on par if not better than Marco Polo. The rooms are spacious and very well appointed (the hotel only opened in September 2010) and there is complimentary wifi in the room as well as all over the hotel. The swimming pool is the biggest out of the hotels in the city (excluding Mactan resorts). The spa almost makes you not want to leave the hotel at all. Right now they are running a promotion for guests for 30% of the spa facilities. I think this promo runs until end of Feb 2011. You really feel you are in a quality 5 star hotel. Having stayed in all the major hotels in Cebu over the years, we will now make this our number one choice. I sincerely hope they can stick to the very high benchmark they have quickly set for themselves! I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel to anyone coming to Cebu City. The hotel also adjoins the largest shopping mall in Cebu, SM.",January 2011,NA

Lostinperth,Nov 2010,5.0 of 5 bubbles,Very Good Experience,"Everything in general offered us a very good experience, from the room to the service and definitely the buffet (which I highly recommend @ approx 1050 peso's net). I would normally stay at the Marriott hotel when in Cebu, but now I will be staying at the Radisson.",November 2010,NA
