Has awesome view of the city from the rooftop resto/pool area which is even better at night time (food prices are reasonable). I love the breakfast buffet which is included in our stay. They have a lot of variety including  my favorite local/filipino breakfast choices, including taho. Among others are continental and other asian ones. Staff are extra friendly and professional.

My only concern was in our bathroom where I didn‚Äôt find a ventilation fan so after showering it stays pretty damp and could explain the moldy grout lines between the shower tiles.  It wouldn‚Äôt stop me from booking here again as the staff and property as a whole are great value and you get best bang for your buck.

The toilet was a bit small, though it's not too small it's a deal-breaker. Anyway, the food. The breakfast buffet was really delicious, but their Japanese resto was easily one of the best Japanese dining experience we've had. Their Tonkotsu ramen is a strong contender for the best in Cebu. It is pricey but it was our Japanese dinner that made our stay in bai unforgettable. Definitely recommend.

I felt like that was very unnecessary and after being woken up by their radios and voices outside really irked me since we were trying to catch up on our sleep.  

They are listed as 4 stars, but it actually feels like a 3 star hotel, so if you can get a good price for the stay, this would be a good place, but do not expect a 4 star hotel.

The check out was really slow, they asked us to wait on the couch for someone to check our room before we can leave.

Anyway, we looked around and there were actually a lot of long tables that were vacant but with the reserved sign. There should be no such thing in a buffet breakfast that's included in everyone's accommodation fee. They let us sit in a very small table for two. There was four of us with three people old and one being a PWD. I was annoyed and mad. I requested again for another table to be open as I can see there are vacant ones.

The staff here are still super graceful and fulfil there duties professionally with the perception that they are happy u came back .happy to see some staff being promoted and duty managers  ma‚Äôam Mariciel food / beverage and Eillen Isral are on the job .this trip I must give a speak mention to Christine roof top bar senior cashier she is so welcoming and goes above and beyond .

Unfortunately, check out was upsetting. A staff wearing a teal uniform as opposed to the usual Front Desk uniform allowed 2 foreign guests to cut the queue when two other guests were in front of them, myself included.

The issue that I have is with the receptionist, elevator and room access, first incedent I don't have elevator access, I went to the receptionist to have it fixed, but only to know when I reached my room (I got elevator access from the other customer with the same floor) there is no access also. The receptionist is not smiling also looks so suspicious even after I prove my identity. The second time I went to the reception, I went directly to the manager after 1 customer he attended to, I was waiting patiently only to find out he needs to reverify me again, I told him was already verified by the previoua receptionist and he can ask him and he told me in a bit higher tone of voice and iritated manner that he needs to reverify, so I did, then there is no apology or empathetic manner I heard from them even though I told him I went from elevator to the reception twice already and I am tired and frustrated. I even overheared him that my access is blocked. I asked him what was thr problem but he ignored my question and he just asked me who is the receptionist who attended me before. I felt really bad that I have to go through all of this. Out of frustration, tiredness and anger and also the urgent need to go to my room to do something urgent, I told them to make sure it will work or else I will come back to them in a very irated manner. So the manager went with me, I was about to tap the elevator access, he told me he already tapped it with his access, I told him i want to tap it myself and check if it is really working. Everything is good except for this and I was about to let it pass but I was not satisfied at how my experience was on this matter and I am hoping it will not happen to the other customers.

The atmosphere was pleasing and calm even though it was a full pack due to the holiday weekend. A lot of food options and you don‚Äôt have to worry if they run out of food and beverages as they are quick to replenish. I have no complaints on the taste of any food they‚Äôve served. Since I so full, I missed to try their Pani Puri,  Italian& Japanese cuisine, customizable noodle counter and other desserts. I guess something to look forward when we come back. As of March 2024 price was at 1,588.00 and check for promotion as we were able to avail the Lenten Piso Special where for every pair, paid for only worth 1 person plus a peso. Go check it out for yourself!

- Be most welcoming when guest having visitors and be more happy for that rather than put a lot of regulation to allow visitors access the facilities, this is has nothing to security roles rather show how much hotel staff happy to welcome visitors of their guest.

The pool bar on the roof is lovely, with a great view of the city.
However, they're not always the most organised- four times, our room keys malfunctioned, and once, a massage appointment was mishandled. The managers made sure that the problems were all rectified, but these things happened once too often. One of the rooms that we had showed signs of mold, but our subsequent rooms were clean. 

In other words, service isn't perfect, but the staff will make the effort. The breakfast buffet, which had a blend of Filipino, Western, Indian, Chinese and Korean dishes was fine. The concierge was also very good, and made sure our transport was well taken care of.

In short, I would still stay at bai Hotel, but I would definitely vocal about any mishap. The staff, at least will do their best to correct any problems that arise.

they claim to be an international hotel but then the staff can‚Äôt talk in English even when we were addressing them in English, we had difficulty understanding Bisaya whenever we had any questions or requests. 

their entrance to the hotel felt like an entrance to the airport where you have to remove your belongings and pass it through a conveyor belt then you have to be searched. so, so inconvenient. felt like i was going to jail. 

housekeeping does not change the sheets everyday even though we clearly stated we wanted them changed, even when we called through their landline they still did not change the sheets when we came back. they only tidied the bed. 

they keep boasting their breakfast buffet was Cebu‚Äôs best in 2022 but damn there were barely any choices. they did not even have soda or japanese cuisine choices available.

6.8,"I stayed here during a visit in Cebu  to view potential real estate investments as I am currently living abroad and lives in a different city in the Philippines.

Upon arrival to property, I was given a twin room and I checked-in ALONE. I told her I very much prefer a large bed which I also mentioned on my booking.

Now imagine if I showed up with a husband? We will be forced to sleep in 2 separate beds because the lady at the front desk was unwilling to do anything about it. No upselling provided, no options given, no nothing.... 

The lacklustre of the service experience was a let-down, not sure why though. The rooms had a lot of defects from the shower room to the poor finishing round the corners of the room. 

It later made sense to me, they wanted to make more money from the rest of their room inventory hence given out their least favorite rooms to guests booked on OTAs such as Agoda. 

So, to make use of the spare bed, I asked my real estate agent to stay with me since there's a bed I am not using, and I was forced to sleep in a smaller bed than what I originally expected to have paid for.   

As  a hotelier myself, this left a bitter taste, or maybe... I EXPECTED WAY MUCH. Nevertheless, breakfast was very good and the front-line team are amazing and were very hospitable throughout.

Transportation getting around Cebu island was easy for tour drivers to pick up & drop us off. As well as traveling by ferry to Bohol & round-trip flight to Boracay.

We checked in late, were tired from traveling, and really needed a decent meal.

6.0,"Had to wait one hour to get in my room. I messaged the hotel in advance  my arrival time and type of room. Not nice after 20h of travel to have to wait that long. They would have let me waited longer if I didn't ask the reception again and again when the room will be ready while most of the other guests just could check-in straight away.
Room was clean, bathroom cleaningness could be improved though (stripes on mirror and glass surfaces looks not good). Windows dirty inside and outside. Parts of the room looked old already. Not possible to connect computer to TV (HDMI or USB-C). 
Internet was good and reliable. 
Room had a door to neighboring room where they played loud music and talked loud including noise of certain activities nobody want to hear! Not nice in this price class!
Security outside extremely rude against vaping outside the designated smoking area on the parking space where nobody else was present or bothered, the guy seemed just bored and had nothing better to do.  I am not a smoker and dont want to smell like an ash tray or inhale cigarette smoke! Smoking area terrible in general. Should have better options for guests in a hotel in this category!
Breakfast was okay though you have to walk long distances to your table and it is very crowded most of the time.
Would maybe book again but never ever a room with door to next room!
Staff is extremely friendly towards guests. Staff should have it's own service elevators though, elevators are over used already by guests, staff going in and out makes it worst.
Location is OK but can't do anything without a taxi ride. Area outside dodgy especially during night time. Beggars and hookers will bother you day and night few steps outside the hotel, not nice. Mall next to the hotel is low grade, need to take taxi to better mall. No nice restaurants or anything within walking distance.

While still dinning they took the used plates and utensils without and excuse.

Almost all staffs and servers are at the bar giggling and does not mind the customers needs.

When we are about to leave no one is roaming around to handle our request and even in the counter no cashier or anybody. Until one customer approaches the counter one server came, then serveral customers followed even us.

So when I arrived  and was about to  Ask for airport transfer... It was only then that I realized I've missed the date.  I was sooo busy with the Fluvial Procession of Sinulog 2024. Our navy is in charge of the security of the Galleon at that time.  I wasn't able to check the schedule. I hope you can consider our reservation be rescheduled to a later date. 

Nevertheless we've checked in in 24-25 January 2024 and found it exceptional.

Was told through email we could check into our room by 0600 which was fine. The person at the front desk told us that would probably not happen as ALL guests checked out at 1100. She also laughed and refused to get the manager when I requested. I was then told I could purchase a room for the night however would need to move out of that room at 1100 and wait until 3 pm to check into my already scheduled room. We agreed to get a room. Hardly slept in 36 hours. THEN we had to wait over 30 minutes to see if a room was ""available."" Again asked to speak with manager whom we were told ""ghosted"" her. The manager then walked out and we informed him of the situation. As full time traveller's, thus was our worst experience in over 16 months travel.

7.6,"We were surprised about the big discount we got at Agoda, especially being able to stay in a high end place like BAI.  For the price we got it in, it was a steal.  However, we soon figured out why.  Unlike the usual / standard rooms at Bai, the ones on the 8th floor seemed to be behind the times.  There was a slight, weird smelly odor in the room (nothing anyone can do),  unlike the rooms we've stayed in so far, it seems like the rooms on this floor were not carpeted.  The pool, because they allow day use, was crowded at the time.  DO not go to the pool until sunset. Since it's on one of the top floors, there is no shade from the burning sun.  I was quite happy with the service and staff. Very excellent. The breakfast buffet was good, lots of options.  And overall we enjoyed it because we realized that the money we were spending just to do a walk-in at their buffet was close to the price that Agoda offered.  So if you think about it that way, that  it's basically just the buffet price  + a place to sleep / stay for the night, then it's a great deal.  Otherwise, you're better off booking at much nicer / more comfortable budget hotels.  
 
 ",0.7
10.0,"Concerned by the increasing number of negative reviews for the initially booked hotel, I opted to cancel my reservation and chose Bai Hotel instead. Despite initially booking with the breakfast option, a system glitch led to its exclusion. Despite addressing the issue with Agoda, it remains unresolved. Agoda promised a response within 24-48 hours but closed the case without providing any information. Consequently, during check-in, an additional fee for breakfast had to be paid. Agoda's lack of partnership with the hotel seemed to hinder their ability to address the situation, preventing me from canceling and rebooking. This disappointing experience with Agoda has left me contemplating the use of their services in the future.

Turning to Bai Hotel, a 4-star establishment, it lived up to expectations. The staff exhibited professionalism, offering a top-notch greeting upon our arrival. As check-in wasn't until 3 pm, we stored our luggage and purchased breakfast vouchers, a process complicated by Agoda's limitations. Thankfully, Maria and Rose proved invaluable in securing the vouchers. Despite the inconvenience of luggage screening at the entrance, the lobby left a lasting impression. Exploring the hotel before check-in, we glimpsed the steakhouse and sushi restaurant.

The room, boasting cleanliness, provided a scenic view of Mactan Island. An evening visit to the 21st floor, where the pool and restaurant were located, revealed an outstanding view. While the pool restaurant's drinks were satisfactory, the appetizers were underwhelming, both in portion size and cost. I strongly advise against ordering Beef Salpicao.

On a brighter note, the buffet breakfast the following day was a positive experience, featuring an impressive array of international dishes. Although lacking in specialties, the variety and quality of the offerings were commendable. With two more nights ahead, I anticipate the remainder of our stay will be enjoyable, despite the early check-out time of 11 am.

While I would love to consider staying here again, the unresolved breakfast issue with Agoda and their system glitch pose a hurdle. If Agoda can address these concerns and enhance their customer care, I would be more inclined to book through them for future stays at Bai Hotel. However, the absence of communication from Agoda regarding the breakfast issue casts doubt on the feasibility of future bookings through their platform.

Hotel staff were very polite and always ready to greet you with a smile.

We dined in the Ume restaurant which the food was decent but the service was extremely slow, even for drinks. But I guess you are pretty stuck unless you were to get a taxi anywhere else. The same was across the other venues such as Twilight. 

Disadvantage is that drinking water was not provided even in the restaurants. All of the other places I‚Äôve stayed in the Phillipines so far had drinking water filters on every floor. 

Also sadly missed out on the breakfast on the second day due to an early flight and it was not a possibility for me to pay for extra to put this towards a buffet dinner the night before.

They scan the bags which I had no problem with. There‚Äôs coffee shops at the place beautiful restaurants that pool bar on the 21st floor is fantastic views I didn‚Äôt make it upstairs to the 22nd floor to the nightclub yet! but after staying one night I booked three more nights over my birthday and made reservations for myself at the steakhouse. Oh and the fitness center actually has some really nice equipment as I like to lift weights. Look forward to staying there again .

The hotel has a ‚Äúhomey‚Äù lobby compared to the ‚Äúfancy‚Äù Radisson Blue. Bai  gives us great value for the money since we are looking for a ‚Äúresort‚Äù hotel when in Cebu. I would also say that the entire staff is what keeps us coming back to stay here as they are all very friendly & helpful and a special shout out to the Caf√© Bai staff (too many of them to name individually) who always remembers our daily breakfast routine (Table 11). I did notice that the breakfast  buffet spread needs a little bit more variety (especially if you‚Äôre eating there on a daily basis weeks at a time) but totally understandable since we may be more of an exception.
Salamat Bai Hotel, keep up the good work and we will keep coming back.

We were staying at the 10th floor, and the hotel has around 20 floors. If nobody came down, the staff woudlnt have known about how bad the shake was. I dont blame the staff, i blame their detection system. We even came a across guests whom we had to calm bc of a past earthquake occurrence, sort off a ptsd. The evacuation area wasnt made clear to the guests too, so ppl just came out to the parking lot by the highway. Luckily the shake wasnt that much of a magnitude. The hotel should fix their detection systems so the staff could prepare and know what to do.

The staff at BAI Hotel are not only professional but also genuinely friendly and accommodating. They go above and beyond to ensure that guests have a memorable and comfortable stay. What impressed me the most was that they never once said no to any of our requests. Whether it was arranging transportation, providing recommendations for local attractions, or accommodating special dietary needs, they always found a way to make it happen.

The hotel itself is a masterpiece of design and architecture. The moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted by a stunning blend of modern elegance and Filipino culture. The attention to detail in the interior decor is remarkable. The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and offer breathtaking views of the city or the sea, depending on your preference. The cleanliness and overall maintenance of the property were impeccable.

One of the standout features of BAI Hotel is the dining options. The restaurants on-site serve a wide range of culinary delights, from local Filipino cuisine to international dishes, all prepared with precision and flavor. The breakfast buffet was a particular highlight, offering a diverse selection of fresh and delicious options to start your day.

The hotel's amenities, including the pool and fitness center, are top-notch, ensuring that guests have plenty of ways to relax and unwind during their stay. Additionally, the hotel's location in Mandaue is convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and transportation hubs.

6.8,"Bai Hotel is a nice hotel, clean and affordable. Our stay was comfortable however I was dismayed with Agoda. I strongly recommend to BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE HOTEL'S WEBSITE AND NOT THRU AGODA. On my last online booking with Agoda, I feel I was scammed. I booked for 2 nights stay for two persons hence I requested for twin beds. I paid 12K plus in pesos (with free breakfast for 1 PAX ONLY!) while the price in the hotel is only around 4800 per night or 9K plus only for 2 nights and with free breakfast for two persons already. SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BOOK DIRECTLY AT THE HOTEL AND NOT THRU AGODA. Because of this experience, probably we will choose another hotel to stay. Bai Hotel should warn Agoda for overpricing since its their hotel's business or reputation will be tarnished. That's our experience.

The room was clean, staff were nice especially the housekeeping ladies who kept on greeting us or smiling at us whenever we glance at them. I understand na Cebuano/Bisaya dialect is being used sa hotel, but I'd appreciate if staff would ask (like reception, phone operator, dining staff) if we know Bisaya or we're comfortable with Tagalog or English. I had to say, ""Sorry I don't know how to speak Bisaya"", and had to ask them to repeat what they're saying in Tagalog/English. Bed was soft and you know that the aircon's air was okay. We had work before our flight so we were surprised that we slept through the day and woke up at 12am. Such a shame that I wasn't able to use their gym nor the pool. Breakfast buffet -- Taho with the waiter in a costume is amusing. I was also surprised na may champorado, banana bread, and different bread loaves, which is very seldom with hotel buffets. I would love if we could interact with the chefs like sa Omelette station, parang may window and di ako sanay. I know na may process but I prefer na makita ko din how it's being cooked. I ended up just getting the ham and cheese omelette which was already cooked and placed in the chaffing dish. I just wish there were more dried fish, squid, or mangoes since Cebu is famous for these. There was an incident as well and the staff was quick to assist us, and had us compensated too. We were not travelers whose fond of complaining but we felt the urge to raise our concern and we were glad it was handled professionally and discreetly. Only room for improvement maybe is the bidet -- lol the pressure was way too high it felt like certain parts of us would be ripped. üòÖ We ended up not using it. Overall, we enjoyed sleeping at Bai and would still stay here whenever we're in the city.

The location is fine and the surrounding area is easily accessible by Grab (like Uber) but it's far from the beaches if that's what you're looking for  (an island hopping day tour requires a 3 hour van ride there and back so half a day is travel).  Dining near the hotel is limited,  mostly   just the mall (within a 5-10 minute walk). The hotel dining seemed pricey for what you get. The bottom line is the hotel is OK but for us not a great fit.

Check in took a grand total of 30 minutes despite only 2 others before us. It was slow. Staff encouraged us to provide cash of 2000 PHP for deposit instead of charging to card, stressing that it takes I think up to 15 days? for refund.

4.4,"Booked as it was recommended by my friend, initially it's not my hotel choice but I just gave it a try. Here what happened though.

My room changed 3x. Lack of  staff communication and request for city view  during booking if not you will be seeing cargo containers during your stay ( harbour view as advertised). 

Room is spacious and safety is the top priority (undergo scanner before entry), only positive during my stay. It's worth it if you will just stay in the hotel most of the time, however if you're out daily and just use it to sleep and rest it's not so worth it anymore ( considered expensive for a solo traveller and compared to other hotels in the city).  Stayed 4D3N and mostly I'm outside ( day tour). On my 2nd day, since I'm a bit sensitive with drinking water (hotel provided:nature's spring), I need to order online different brand of water (7liters) and other necessities. The driver was not allowed to enter even at the lobby or entrance door at least, I need to pick up my delivery items outside (near the main street) which is really inconvenient and difficult most especially it's heavy (my reason ordering online so I won't carry it too long since I'm having back pain). Nobody offered to help me out and staffs are just watching me, entrance staff did not open the main door even he saw me carrying heavy things, I just hope at least he can open it as I don't expect him to help me carry. I'm really disappointed on that time. I don't expect them to carry it for me since it's my things but at least have the act of initiative to offer help (just opening the door for me to go in since my hands are full is already a big help).

Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è: Worst bathroom/toilet floors I have seen in my life: very slippery ( dangerous! High fall risk).

Otherwise, has a good view at the top floor bar area but need to use stairs going up. Not sure if they have lift for PWD.

Btw, don't forget to bring cash or credit card with you as you needed to deposit php 8000(check in). They don

- near the beds no power outlets for even charging one device. Should be impossible in the era we live.
- airco in the room is noisy and we experienced a most unpleasant air atmosphere which contained a lot of moisture and smells
- after having taken just a normal shower, the mirror in the bathroom was full of condense.  A modern 5-star hotel should have heated mirrors
- elevators: there are 6 elevators that seem to operate randomly. If controlled more smart, they could have been much more efficient.

I placed my son's cereal on a paper cup for several reasons, one it is safer than breakable ceramic, and secondly, taking away the cereal of my 5 y.o. child would mean him crying and crying, it would have been more humane if that staff gave a consideration to the child for, but I believe doing that judging stance is uncalled for and very unprofessional. but over all our bai weekend was a very nice experience

Location is nice since it had a mall adjacent to it, but otherwise, anything else 'Cebu' will require a Grab or taxi ride.  Staff could also be trained in being problem-solvers and resourceful. Default response is often 'sorry sir, we're out' or 'we can't ' or 'I don't know' or 'sorry this is the way we've been doing it'. Otherwise a great stay.

Was put in a pedestrian rate room farthest from elevator, on a floor where construction activities were taking place.

This is a popular hotel facility for singles & couples Chinese & Korean travelers.  Not so for single PWD business travelers.

Was moved to a PWD room as it became available.  Air con was an issue for regulating temp.  Second day it leaked directly into my suit cases.  No offer for free laundry or other to accommodate.  I had to do my own laundry in room to have clothes for our conference. 

Free breakfast seems to be an inordinate focus of staff.   It‚Äôs a nice breakfast buffet.  Seems well stocked and nicely displayed‚Ä¶if not done so to use the maximum amount of space.

The breakfast buffet seems to be an inordinate focus of staff.  Yet, no accommodation is made for PWD or business travelers.  I had to navigate through the hung-over Chinese couples, and Korean couples with kids to get my breakfast safely to my far corner single table.

We needed to walk and pick up our food from there. Two; hotel trollies can only service you within the hotel lobby to any floors. They can't go down to the basement parking or parking lot area around the hotel. So, if you are parked at the basement, you need to take the stairs or the elevator yourself and drive your car up outside the lobby. 

I also want to mention that when we checked in, we paraded the lobby carrying large duffle bags and back packs yet none of the staff offered us a trolley. I think they should rename the hotel ""Bye""?

Good Bai, to Good Bye! Me and our group had so much stress in this hotel. Hope they review their policies.

9.2,"Maybe it's just me, but I think this is a favored hotel for foreigners and csw's. They're teeming in the lobby, the buffet restaurant, and at the elevator entrance/exits. There are a lot of ofw's as well, with their family coming to fetch them. It is understandable as it is near the airport, the price is reasonable especially if there's a promo, and it also includes a buffet breakfast with the rate. Security is top notch as xray being done for everyone who enters the main lobby. Elevator will only work with your own room card. Plenty of choices for buffet breakfast with one station devoted mainly to SK tourist or long term cebu staying SK. There are a lot of them here as well. Parkmall just across the road offers lots of foid choices if you don't want to eat at the hotel. Poolbar and pool at the top of the hotel was nice, although always full. Daily housekeeping makes up the room and makes one stay comfortable. TV's audio is maxed at vol 25, so you can't disturb other guests. Always ask to be placed at the high floors and away from the elevator.

When entering the lobby all your belongings will be checked and questioned. So we had to get approval from the management to bring in a little siccors which is always part of our travel stuff.

The down side happened during the entourage preparation. None of the staff assisted with the elevators as we were put on different floors. So we had to communicate with the rest of the entourage on who has the key card to go to the floor where we need to go as there are only 2 key cards provided per room.
It was a bit stressful as my aunt who has difficulties in walking had to wait which cousin has the keycard to move from one floor to the other.

Gives added comfort as a guest. Checking in friendly staff, rooms have always been perfectly cleaned and stocked daily upon request. Housekeeping is 5 Star spot on ! 5*  Pool on 21st floor is fantastic and can view beautiful sunset. Open until 11pm if i recall.  Friendly staff great ambience and view of the city.  Rooftop bar aslo great view loud club music , hard to carry conversation , but that's the ""club atmosphere "".  Service a little slow but we were distant table from the bar, understandable.  We added the buffet add on when booking , nice selection, fruits , omelets and many offers.  Huge buffet and dining room hope for a close table or can be a hike to get a 2nd plate.  Nice staff and very courteous.   Overall would definitely recommend and im sure I'll stay again ony next trip.   Large mall across the street with many food options if you want to dine out. Bai Cafe excellent baristas , super friendly, was icing on the cake. Servcie with a smile.  Good flow of taxi during the day , small wait after 9pm , maybe 10 min+.  Traffic pretty smooth the CEB-mactan airport. Approximately 15 min cab ride on pm trip to airport 9/10pm

The room was comfortable and clean. The only thing I didn't like was our room had a view of the air conditioning units on the 8th floor.  Tip: Pay for the breakfast when you book, well worth it. If you buy breakfast its P988 or about $20 pp, buy at booking only cost us extra $6 pp. The pool bar and rooftop bar were both well stocked and we took advantage of both. Live band on Saturday night and it got crowded, so get up there early if you want to go. Overall, a great experience and will book again when we visit Cebu next.

They offer a small box being passed off as a fridge. Instant coffee such a great deal. No extra plates and silverware if you bring in food. Tons of security, you go though medal detector, bag screening and temperature check every time you enter the hotel! If you are dropped off by auto, they run mirrors around the bottom and check trunk, does that make you feel safe staying there? The staff loves to tell you the hotel rules every chance they can. Their smiles aren‚Äôt there because everyone is required to wear a mask, does this appeal to you? The price charged per night is not worth the headache at this hotel. There is near nothing around the property to do. They have something to learn from the Coro Hotel in Makati Manila.

8.8,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well. 

Departure was fairly smooth, though.

This puts Bai just below the most expensive hotel in town. 150p is a more reasonable rate and max I'd expect. The canned soft drinks are equally as over priced and need lowering. The other problem, I've raised with the awesome staff is the beer is not cold enough. At 190p it should be ice cold beer and the staff need a freezer. Refrigerator chilled beer is not cold enough in this climate.

My sole disappointment was their buffet breakfast for which I had to pay P500.00 since my booking did not include this. It was more of the choice (or lack thereof). They try to be international but it's like the same chicken pieces in different sauces. Where's the bacon? Is this not a standard in buffet breakfasts? The egg chef was hidden at the back, away from the main buffet corridor. This badly needs an improvement considering the type of hotel they are.

""Unfortunately, my recent stay at Dusit hotel did not live up to my expectations in terms of value for money. The room rates were quite high compared to the quality of accommodation provided. Additionally, the food prices at the hotel restaurant were exorbitant, making dining on-site unaffordable for a budget-conscious traveler like myself. I also observed that other hotels in the area offer more competitive rates and inclusive packages that would have been a better value for the money. Overall, I was disappointed with the overall affordability and value proposition of my experience at Dusit Hotel

Upon arrival, I was initially taken aback by the additional charge for a sea view room. However, my surprise quickly turned into delight when the front desk graciously informed me that they had upgraded our accommodation free of charge. This upgrade was in recognition of our anniversary celebration and impending proposal, setting the tone for an unforgettable experience.

The panoramic view of metropolitan Cebu from our upgraded sea view room was simply breathtaking, stretching from Liloan to Mandaue. It provided a stunning backdrop for our romantic getaway and added an extra touch of magic to our special occasion.

Each morning, we were treated to a delicious breakfast spread that catered to every taste. The pool, with its expansive infinity design and captivating views, offered the perfect setting for relaxation and leisure.

The refreshing scent of the comfort room near the elevator contributed to the overall ambiance, enhancing our mood throughout our stay. Despite the pebbled sand on the beach, the crystal-clear waters and abundance of fish created a serene atmosphere reminiscent of Amanpulo, making our beach outings truly enjoyable.

The efficient air conditioning in our room ensured maximum comfort, allowing us to escape the tropical heat and unwind in peace. The hotel went above and beyond to accommodate my request to display a proposal message on the TV screen, leaving my girlfriend pleasantly shocked and adding an extra layer of romance to our stay.

The unexpected gesture of a complimentary moose cake for our anniversary was a delightful surprise, surpassing all expectations. Furthermore, the expedited check-in and check-out processes exemplified the hotel's commitment to exceptional service and guest satisfaction.

Despite mentioning a security deposit, the hotel demonstrated flexibility and consideration, given the short duration of our stay. The actual view of the building exceeded the images advertised on Agoda and their website, further enhancing the overall experience.

Moreover, the availability of HD channels on the TV and the thoughtful gesture of designing roses and flowers added an extra touch of elegance to our anniversary celebration, making it truly memorable.

In summary, Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu provided an unforgettable and magical experience, making our anniversary celebration one for the books. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to create special memories on a special occasion.

The spacious rooms were well maintained by the attentive housekeeping staff. Although there was one thing I noticed, the floor looked clean but after walking inside the room without the slippers we would notice our feet got dirty like some soot. The staff was friendly and helpful, some were probably new because they were kind of shy and reluctant, but overall added to our enjoyable experience.

The massage at the spa was okay, but you can get better quality treatments in town for a cheaper price. The gym was well equipped, but there were no towels or cleaning supplies to wipe down the machines when we went around 6:30-7:00 am (and six people using the gym at the time so it‚Äôs not like equipment wasn‚Äôt being used). The food was fine, though there are not many healthy options if you‚Äôre watching what you eat‚Äî even the kale was fried. The Thai restaurant had the best food, but it needed more spice or at least the usual condiments for guests to spice their food to their liking. A San Mig is 350 pesos at the hotel. There aren‚Äôt easy-to-get-to dining options outside of the hotel so you can feel captive to the pricing and options. It was hard to find servers or get their attention except in the morning or if you‚Äôre sitting directly at a bar.

Overall build quality of this place was disappointing. The shower head holder was cracked (photo attached) which caused the shower head to drop on my wife's head on the first night. Not sure what the interior designer was smoking when he/she designed the bathroom area but expect a mini flood after taking a shower as there isn'ta barrier to block the water from flowing into the rest of the bathroom (photo attached)
Staff here are very nice I'll give them that but poorly trained, feels like this is a place for interns or rejects from Sheraton/Shangri la, huge let down.
If you are looking for white sand beach then this is not the place, no beach whatsoever unless you count that janky lip around the tip of this hotel.
Lastly, food here is average, not bad but then again if you are going to call yourself 5 stars then get it right. We tried the sports bar restaurant, no different than an outback steakhouse kind of vibe.
The Thai restaurant was decent so I'd go there if you are desperate and don't want to travel out.

6.8,"A few relevant comments pertaining to the ratings:
LOCATION: 1* 
Mactan is not really an attractive vacation spot by itself, we picked it due to a late booking at the prime time of the year. Poor infrastructure, and the wreck of a stranded cargoship near the hotel facility do not precisely improve on that perception.

HOTEL: 4* 
Relatively good value for money even after considering the peak season pricing. 
Our room had sea-view and was impeccably clean. The utilities worked flawlessly.

FACILITIES (Pool, restaurants, bars, and games): 5* 
The pool is particularly well designed, spacious and clean. Restaurants and bars serve a wide range of food, even for discerning tastes.
A pool-table and foosball round off the excellent leisure facilities.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
(1) A compulsory gala dinner on the new year‚Äôs eve is understandable (for planning purpose), yet a basic allowance of alcohol like a glass of wine and a beer per person would have advisable and considerate, given the premium price tag. More disturbing than the charge itself, was the need to pop out the purse and pay for every serving, which disturbed the celebrations.
(2) The second nuisance on which management didn‚Äôt act even after strong complaints by several guests, was the faux ‚Äúreservation‚Äù of pool-loungers by hotel guests who were not present. Incidentally, we observed how 2 loungers were blocked with pool-towels for 5 hours (9:00 AM ‚Äì 2:00 PM) by a couple. Then they showed up for just 30 minutes and left again. It is beyond comprehension why the lifeguard hands out towels to people who immediately leave, after block-dropping them on a scarce number of loungers, and why the hotel management tolerates this practice to the detriment of all other guests.

Thai restaurant which was so good was only available for dinner. Felts stranded there and had to keep eating at the bar for a few days. My husband also got the worst food poisoning from the sandwich bought at the deli. They probably make it and leave it there for days. I know cause we bought the salmon bagel on the first day and it was just 1 left and for the next few days they never made new ones.

The location is not advisable if you are planning  to always use grab. Very far from the city center, markets and restaurants. 

Rooms are great with a nice seaview and staff are very accomodating. Facilities are good as well. 

I booked this hotel because it is cheap for a hotel that have a beach and swimming pool. I was expecting that hte hotel will have sea shore where I can walk by the morning and night as seen in their photos, but unfortunately they only have a small fake white sand which is not good walking on barefoot. Specially  when there's  a lot of ants.

As the way I see it, this hotel is preferred  by foreigners (Specially  koreans) for their huge infinity pool.

One more thing that I didn't  like aside from the fake small sea shore is the old abandoned ship that is near the hotel. It ruins the sea view.

Our check in wasn‚Äôt smooth. Upon arriving, the usherettes at the front waved to us but didn‚Äôt explain where we had to enter from. We even by passed the metal detectors and no one said a thing. 

The front desk staff were courteous but not overly friendly or warm to us. I live in hotels for 6 month out of the year and I can tell you that when I‚Äôm greeted warmly I feel more connected to the hotel chain and am more likely to rebook. This was my first time staying at Dusit Thani.  

Rooms are clean but older looking. Bathroom is clean enough‚Ä¶and doesn‚Äôt have the aged tiles and dirty looking grout that you often have in hotels in SE Asia. 

The view of the shoreline and beach is ruined by garbage floating in the crystal clear water.  We asked the waitress and she said it was because of the squatters nearby. Not sure if this is true. 

Also there is a huge ship that drifted about 200 meters from shore. They‚Äôre currently dismantling it. You can hear banging and see sparks flying. But it‚Äôs sort of entertaining to watch while you swim. Lol.

Our room was already ready when we arrived at around 11:30am. The front desk staff we have encountered are all very helpful and even gave recommendations for our Cebu City visit. It is quite difficult to travel from the resort due to its location however the concierge can always call a taxi for the guests. The restaurant where the buffet breakfast is served is huge so it doesnt get too crowded and we never had to fall in line just to eat. There are not much options though in the room service menu so we had quite a hard time looking for food for our picky toddler. There is a big play area for children but it is not airconditioned (or aircon not working at the time we visited) so my daughter did not maximize her time there as it was just too hot.

5.2,"We went to de-stress but upon check-in, our stress piled up. It took them more than an hour to check us in and giving us reason that room availability was an issue.  so I said if that is the case you should reach out to your guests as check in time is 2pm and we check in past 5pm. When I said I want my money back so I can check on another hotel, the room became available. The room they gave us was not the room we booked - 2 Single Bed. And to top it, there was no ‚Äúmain door‚Äù on the bathroom, block out curtain was not functional and so was the WiFi. Since we were so tired to have dinner in their restaurant, we ordered room service. And again, it took them more than an hour to deliver the food and when I complained the staff said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give u a complimentary juice‚Äù. Of course I said ‚Äúno thank you!‚Äù Our expectation is better service bec we paid much.
I was so pissed when I woke up the following morning bec the sun was going to our room and woke us all early. So called them and demanded that we be transferred to another room. They did transfer  us and I asked them why they were not able to give us better rooms when we checked in when the hotel was not even fully booked. So I asked the reception staff that I want to talk to the manager or supervisor to complain all the inconvenience we are experiencing. And she said no manager but will asked the supervisor to call us. Guess what, no calls.  
And one more thing I notice is that they seem to treat the foreign guests better than the local guests. This was particularly obvious to me when we went to the Thai Restaurant. We were told that only reservations allowed but when I insisted they gave us a table.

CONS:  The breakfast is disappoiting, not the kind of buffet i expected for such price 1,300Php per head from a luxury resort. so very few selections.. not worth it.  next is we felt some sort of discrimination and bias, ex: some of your staff missed to greet us a goodevening or goodmorning  but greeted the foreigners behind us when we passed by with them and during the breakfast we were only offered juice but they offered all sorts of coffee and tea to foreigner guests next to our table. most of the bench at the lower deck in front of the pool are stained with bird poops. i hope they can improve on this especially for the price the guests are paying for.

We ended up wasting a lot of time in the room waiting for the issue to be resolved. It‚Äôs hard to believe that this is the standard of rooms at such an extravagantly priced hotel.

Plus no beachfront at all. You have just your average infinity pool and small cold one tucked away. And you could only have a buffet during breakfast.

The general manager, Mike Kempf, was very responsive to feedback and took the time to make sure that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. The suite room was spacious and had all the amenities we needed, including universal plugs and USB ports, which made it easy to use and charge our electronic devices.

The pool at the hotel was a highlight of our stay - it was beautifully maintained and the perfect place to relax and cool off. The beach was small but peaceful, with clear waters that were perfect for swimming. We also had the opportunity to try the food at the hotel's speciality Thai restaurant, and it was absolutely divine. The Executive Chef, Chef Karthik Ravi, was also very helpful in making sure that our family had meals that met our dietary requirements.

The children especially loved the ""Fun Zone"" kids play area and spent hours there every day. The staff at the hotel were generally friendly and courteous, and we had a wonderful time at the New Year's Eve party where we were seated with the general manager and his family to bring in 2023.

There were a few areas where the hotel could make improvements to enhance the guest experience. For example, the Sunset Bar could be more efficient in taking and filling orders, which would likely increase food and drink sales. It would also be beneficial to have a wider selection of cuisine, particularly for those following a vegetarian diet, and to review the in-room dining process to ensure that hot food is delivered. Additionally, an expanded menu with a variety of options to cater to different palettes would be welcome.

Having a knowledgeable and proactive general manager like Mike Kempf can truly make a difference in the overall experience of a hotel guest. As the head of the hotel, the general manager plays a crucial role in setting the tone for the entire property and ensuring that all guests feel w

Which is why I was disheartened over two things:

- For some unexplainable reason (they literally couldn't or just refused to explain it), they couldn't charge our room for the dinner and buffet breakfast. I had to get my credit card back in my room, twice. Why can other hotels do it but they can't? I don't know, they couldn't tell me either.

- For the prices we were paying, you'd think breakfast was included, but nope, you had to pay for it. I would've appreciated a 'lower-tier' set breakfast instead of a buffet for what we were paying for the overnight stay, but it was either a buffet breakfast or none at all. And since they still couldn't charge the room, I had to yet again go back to my room to get my credit card.

Oh, the beach isn't totally something to write home about. Plus there's a beached ship that hasn't been removed yet.

For the prices we were paying, I'd probably skip them and go to the Shangri-La instead.

BUT.. 
1.  When we were eating/drinking at the bar (3 occassions during our trip) Our experience with the service was terrible ): DO NOT get me wrong; the staff was super nice!! However, for our experience, it took us atleast 15-20 minutes to get only two drinks every time we dined in. I'm not sure if they were short staffed which is understandable if they were. But they weren't even busy and not much customers were there during that time.

Then, when it came to ordering  food (bar area again), it took more than 30 minutes. I ordered the pizza, and it arrived cold. I didn't want to complain because I was already tipsy and having a good time haha. Didn't want to ruin the vibe.
Being a 5-star hotel, this part was sad.

2. If the pool did not close so early (8pm), it would have been perfect ): After our tours which lasted during the day, it ends and we get dropped off back to the hotel around 7:30/8pm. Wish they closed at 10 So we can relax at the pool after getting a tour ):

3. the wifi was REALLY terrible. I couldn't connect to it in the hotel room.  I couldn't access to yotube through the TV

4. At times, when I contact front desk/concierge for something, they don't answer.  However, when I went downstairs to the lobby, they were talking to other guests. it seems that they are short staffed.

5. The thai restaurant closes earlier than the time it was supposed to be! ):

Overall, still a great experience.
Not going to give this 1 star because I know they can improve on this :) Hopefully, they will see my review!

The receptionist was not able to explain their amenities, the direction, and accessibility time which got me confused because they have 3 buildings.

On a positive note, the infinity pool was really nice and the landscape of the resort is very relaxing.

They have a happy hour buy-one-take-one promo where I ordered 2 different cocktails for me and my friends which have different price tags. I was expecting 2 line items on my bill but they charged me only 1 but with the price of the more expensive cocktail. I have to explain in 2 different occassions about the differences in price tags and how the invoice should look like before they finally get it.

1. No one assisted us when we arrived. We were the ones who pushed the cart for our luggages.
2. Room wasnt that clean as there were so many dusts.
3. They do not allow guests to bring the towels which means you have to walk wet, water dripping the floor going to your room.
4. They should have a certain portion in their resto where they can accommodate people who have already gone for swim and would like to take thw breakfast in between since there are really guests who would dip the pool as early as 7am and takes breakfast late. Its very inconvenient to go to the room and change then after breakfast change again. If other resorts have managed to do that, there's no reason you can't.
5. Staff are not accommodating. Even if they will see you needing for help, if you don't say or ask, they won't extend a help. Save those who are in their deli resto because they really are.

Had I not prepaid the room weeks ago, we would have walked out. Check-in was terrible and the room is unclean. The floor is very dusty and the toilet was leaking. 

It felt like I booked a budget hotel but paid so much more. Minimal price difference from other well known hotels in the area. Do not make the same mistake. The beach is meh.

- To use the table and chairs in the open restaurants, you must purchase the buffet, regardless of how much you spend on a la carte. This means that you are forced to sit on uncomfortable bean bags next to the pool, with the mosquitoes. I was spending far in excess of the cost of the buffet, but they still insisted that we move out the restaurant to a cramped bar area (there were 7 of us) or sit outside by the side of the pool.

If you want a few days away with just a pool, restaurant, gym and other normal hotel facilities then yes a good place to visit. If you want to move away from the hotel then it will cost you a fortune in taxi‚Äôs to get around. If you hire a car you will spend most of your time in traffic. We hired a scooter and found that the best way to get around though a little dangerous as the roads are pretty scary with lack of road discipline from other road users.
We had to ask reception to have the room cleaned daily even though there was a make my room illuminated sign to notify the housekeeping staff you wanted the room made up..
Facilities in general were good, Infiniti  pool was great, gym was good and the restaurants also good. When we stayed breakfast was in different restaurant locations within the hotel and sometimes buffet and other time A La cart, choice of food for breakfast was ok but could have been better with a wider choice of offerings.
We had a Delux sea view room which was great and spacious with the usual amenities you would expect from a Dusit Thani property . Staff were great and always pleasant and helpful.

We stayed at Building 3 and would be woken up sometimes by the noise of construction work in the morning. Maybe not open Bldg 3 for guests until after construction is done? They also need to do something about the weird smell in the first floor of Building 3. 

Overall, a wonderful and decent stay.

We were tired and exhausted by then - it was a hot, humid day and instead of being able to spend a few hours relaxing we had to be bitten by mosquitoes while waiting in the lobby.  The staff did say we could enjoy facilities, however we just really wanted our room to rest on thay day.

We took our lunch at the sports bar and waited. It took me more than 5 follow-ups before we were able to get to our room. Fellow travelers checking in that day also had the same experience. Worse, when we got to our room at first, it was not prepared yet - miscommunication, they gave room 3101 instead of 3501. 

We understand it was a peak holiday. There were lots of free rooms, but they weren't cleaned yet. As a suggestion, the resort can hire extra help to do cleaning on days like these. Our room's bathroom was moldy, far what I expect from a 5star.

They did allow us to check out late. Lucky our flight back to Manila was late, but how about those with early flights? 

Nevertheless, the resort's facilities such as the pool is superb. I also like the sports bar staff, they were great. To the front desk's credit, they were courteous and respectful all along.

With the exception of the 100M swimming pool and the view of the beach, everything else from the food served (whether paid or part of the room package), the ‚Äúclub room‚Äù, the service and the generally warmth and welcoming demeanor of the staff was not there.

It is understandable that the hotel was still going through restoration as an aftermath of the typhoon last December but why open and operate almost 180-rooms if the service is sub-par. Why use the typhoon as a reason for the poor experience every paying customer have to go through? Definitely unacceptable especially if you‚Äôre a full-paying customer.

5.6,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 
The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness.
The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entree's though need to have more variety. Benjarong was closed when we were there due to repairs. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom where we were though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

Over-all rating -- 3.5 to 4

- big and clean rooms, hot&cold with functional shower, big flat screen tv, generous on providing drinking water
- unique and wide infinity pool
- very friendly and kind staff! Kudos to Alvin from the restaurant, Nic from the happy hour bar, and Chris from the lunch buffet who were the most above and beyond among everyone. But they were all kind.
- wifi is fast but only available for in house guests
- with happy hour, though beach is small, it was nice
- breakfast buffet had a lot of choices and they were not thrifty on the meat like bacon, corned beef, sausages, tocino, etc.

Cons(-)
- location is in the far end
- gym and game room were not available
- ala carte menu has very limited choices
- though staff was friendly, service was sometimes really slow
- unlike other resorts, they dont allow delivery food from outside despite their limited menu choices

What I like with my stay was that the staff was there to assist as perhaps coz there were very few guests at that time and we almost had the pool to ourselves. There was no buffet breakfast but they offered a generous breakfast for me and my sister.  Our accommodation was very roomy but it made me wonder why we were not given the ocean view since there were not many guests coming in at that time. Upgrading, perhaps, is not this hotel's thing. So much for getting what I paid for. hahaha! Seriously, I booked a room at less than 5k a night, with free breakfast.

First of all, they treated us like kings. And I‚Äôm talking royalty royalty. We arrived in our Deluxe Room and saw there were no bathtubs and being a couple, we needed one. The front desk immediately offered a room exchange. They even sent someone to carry our luggage, AGAIN! 
In the new room, we have our bathtub, we are very happy and the employee that assisted us was lovely. 
Then, we realize that the water is lukewarm and coming from the slides, we needed a shower ASAP. The front desk offered a room change yet again and to our delightful surprise, we received a free upgrade.

The Hotel is made for ""Stay Inside"". You have 5 (or more) Restaurants inside, a giant Poolside with 3 pools (one behind the J Tower). But also the pools... 1/4 of the poolside smells for diesel (because of the nightly fire show), 2/4 of the pools smells for septic tank...
But the most nagging is their Greediness! 30K for a night regular rate, and you are charged for extra 100 Pesos for using the wall plug in the business center!! 2.500 Pesos for a average Diner buffet, but you are charged for 100 Pesos extra for the Beer Tap. And at the end it is a philippino hotel: Faucets are ""flexible"", toilets out of order, seals of the bath tub let the showering water rinse down to the next flor... Overpriced. I think they don't want other Customers than Koreans, i think 90% of the guests are koreans, very nice, best hotel guests you can spend time with.

1) Room- mactan ocean view suite was large and roomy and had an amazing view. 2 bathrooms and a separate living area and bedroom area- much needed for a family of 4 for a week‚Äôs stay.  Note: for the very first night, we booked a deluxe room (cheaper) since we arrived at 3:30am. The deluxe room was not 5 star. The bathrooms looked dingy and the caulking was horrid. Hopefully all the deluxe rooms do not look like this. We were so happy to move to our mactan suite. 

2) spa - 5 star spa. I went twice to try two different packages. Highly recommend shynn. Her hands were magical. I left fully relaxed and highly recommend this spa. Gabby at front desk was also very nice and professional. 

3) food- abalone breakfast buffet- 5 star all the way. A multicultural breakfast buffet of Filipino, Korean, American, Japanese and a full pastry section. Only thing I‚Äôd recommend is to maybe have the expresso section be able to customize drinks. They make the most amazing lattes but don‚Äôt have the stuff to customize like caramel or chocolate :) special shout out to Jonathan for his amazing service.

note: we tried the coral,  Korean, Chinese, Japanese and all the pool bar food. Never had a bad experience. 

Housekeeping: very good 

Pororo cafe: nice but pricey for what it is. For the price we are paying per night, would be nice to have one free play time. 

d-thrones: the mini scooter car rentals for kids . 300 pesos for 30 minutes. So fun and worth it.

Babysitting: there are babysitters who offer care at the pool area while parents can relax. They all seem to offer different rates but it‚Äôs very affordable. Tip them well. They do a great job to actually give the parents a relaxing vacation as well . It seemed about 50 percent of the guests were aware of this service and used babysitters. 500 pesos is paid to the hotel to host them for the day at the resor

JPark is one of a must try hotel if you're visiting cebu and if you have children and want to give them a great Cebu experience.

7.2,"The staff were great - smiles and friendly attitudes all around.
We stayed in 909-B (Deluxe Ocean View).
A/C in the lifts/elevators - but as soon as the doors open for your floor - whammo! - Heat and humidity, but it's not an open air hallway, so why not turn on the visible A/C units in the ceiling? 
Though the bed was comfortable, the room needs to be renovated - dated from the 1990's and the chase lounge in the room... the foam pad is so old it doesn't fit correctly into the cover and it's very uncomfortable - Bathroom has combined bath/shower. Very narrow bath that caused both of us to have a few near accidents.  Also, the drainage around the bath is poor and they rigged up a pipe under the counter to do this, but it's clogged and ran slow.
The breakfast buffet (madhouse) is mediocre at best.  Food temps too low - eggs cold - not warm - cold.  ""Juices"" are some sort of powered mix - no signs of any bits of fruit in them.  If you want bacon ask one of the roaming chefs around the buffet - they keep it in the back to avoid the stampede.
The staff are the real reason for the success of this property - management need to bring this hotel into the 2020's.
Would we stay here again?... Perhaps, but not until the place was renovated.
(The ""Casino"" next to the hotel only has table games - no machines.)

We are disappointed with the breakfast buffet. The food are either too salty, too oily, bland or have plenty of cornstarch slurry. Only the breads are good. Restaurants inside the hotel are good though especially Nonki - the Japanese restaurant and the J lounge.

Close to what you would expect from a 5-star hotel  for this price- our children love the place and spend their whole time in the 3 swimming pools so I will focus here only on (smallish) ""opportunities for improvement""... Staff very polite and accomodating but takes five calls (same last time) and 3 or 4 hours to get them install the additional bed, even though already requested at check-in time. Don't hesitate to call 0 several time to get what you need... Drinkable water supply commitment is unclear. Ridiculous smallish bottles provided once per day (if you are here to remind them how many you are in the room when they clean up). Better walk to 7/11 300 meters away and buy 10 liters bottles of mineral water... No bidet spray on the toilet bowl, does it have to be the European way?

I showed the reception my booking, check in time 1400, She then said, sill I have to pay 500 peso if I check in now. I opted to wait till 1400.
The other thing is visitor not allowed to visit guest anywhere. I am a balikbayan, therefore I have family I want to invite for dinner however to my disappointment they were not allowed to visit unless I pay 2000 peso. I styed in a lot of Hotel and I never had this 
experience. 
We then went to Coral for dinner, my husband ordered fish and chips, it came out as fish and potato wedge, the wedge was so hard and fish is over cooked. Me husband could not even eat it, so I returned the food. I order another dish which is prawn garlic herbs that was also over cooked and very dry. 
My husband at that time was not happy and left, I ate the rest as I didn't want to waste food. our stay in this resort was not a very good one. I will never come back again and I will never recommend this resort to my family and friends.

We just missed it coz of the rain during our stay. Snorkling is fun, they provide lifevest for uncertain one, so just have some fun. Sadly typhoon Odeth just visited the area before us and damage not only parts of the property but the reef also, it deprive us of diving also. Maybe next time when we visited again.

The only thing that bothers me is  the streets going there. I know Cebu is very famous of her small street.. Goodness can't their LGU make a one way of this streets?  Considering the Standard it is a one lane street luckily everybody accepts the 2 way purpose. So if you don't have the nerve to ride a car in this area better leave it... I've accepted the challenge but with la lot of cursing. Don't worry! Only my passenger heard them all.

If you only stay at the resort then everything is fine.  If you want to roam around I'd rather suggest to know their public transportation network or hail a cab or grab(√ºber).

They just want to make money by ripping u off on their high rate for car service. They acted like their was no way to get a taxi unless by chance they were dropping another guest off. I have stayed several hotels in close proximity of this resort and never had this issue. One they are liars two they almost force u to utilize their car service. The individual we spoke to the day before said their were no shuttles we can utilize the following day its funny be cause the day i left they said it had to be booked in advance.

I find that odd because I stayed at two other resorts the past weeks and they all were able to easily book a taxi for me.

I queued for almost 2 hours. When I eventually got to the desk dehydrated and tired. No water, no welcome drinks. Just a long line to greet me. When I tried to check in, even though I paid upfront a few weeks ago. They advised me to wait for my room to be ready. I asked for the manager, they said maybe I can speak to the duty manager at 7pm! 

I eventually got my room, which was nice. Just shame the management seems oblivious about the first impressions of guests as he/she is missing from the action. 

I encountered other incidences such as no towels at 9am by the pool and told to come back in an hours time. And having to pay cash for facilities IN the hotel.

The room was clean and well-maintained, providing a comfortable environment for relaxation. In terms of value for money, Seda Ayala Center Cebu is an excellent choice. The rates are reasonable, especially considering the prime location and the quality of the accommodations.

However, there is one area that could use improvement: the buffet breakfast. While the food itself was good, the breakfast area can get quite crowded, making it a bit chaotic. It would be great if the hotel could find a way to better manage the crowd during breakfast hours.

Overall, Seda Ayala Center Cebu is a great option for anyone visiting Cebu. The unbeatable location next to Ayala Mall, clean rooms, and good value for money make it a solid choice. If they can address the breakfast crowd issue, it would make the stay even better.

From the front desk to the security/front door men to the wait staff, every staff went above and beyond.  I cannot say enough but the place needs an overhaul renovation. The wallpaper on the ceiling in the reception area are peeling, the rooms have a musky old smell to the shabby carpets on each elevator bank to name a few. I‚Äôve stayed at the IT Bloc and this place has a newer modern ambiance. Overall Seda Ayala Center gets three stars. One for the fantastic staff, two for the location, and three convenience being the center point to every where.

I will say that after a month plus stay in various locations in the Philippines on this trip, which included staying in 8 higher end resorts and hotels, I consider myself an expert on breakfast buffets.   The Seda's can definitely use some improvement.  It is the only buffet in the last month I walked away hungry from.  I felt the options were very limited for the western palate.

However the lobby was very nice almost to the point of exceptional, Steve was friendly and helpful but as with most every buffet I have been to in the Philippines, 90% of the food has been cool too cold. A real health concern of mine. I might have said I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place. But I do believe that I am being a bit  Tough on them as I said the Mercati diamond which I had stayed at in Manila was exceptional as a matter of fact I would say so far that they have said the bar.

8.8,"Most notable, this is in a very convenient location in heart of Cebu City, with a short and sheltered walk into the Ayala mall.  Breakfast buffet (included in our stay) was exceptional.   Staff was very helpful and accomodating.  

Some critiques:  somewhat worn carpeting in hallways.  Layout of bathroom is not very good for privacy, with shower easily viewable from entry door unless bathroom door is COMPLETELY closed.  But, also noted that the ventilation in the bathroom is very good, with the plentiful airflow exiting through the shower ceiling to keep humidity low after showering (wife appreciates this for doing all her girly stuff at the bathroom counter).  Mini-fridge is in a cabinet with poor ventilation (since the furniture is pressed against the wall, blocking the vent holes in the back) and I kept the cabinet doors slightly open to encourage better operation of the fridge while there - it's like 120+F inside that cabinet if I don't do that. 

We stayed there for a couple consecutive nights on two different occasions during our trip, the first was during the Sinulog, and the other was about a week later.  During Sinulog, and there were frequent performances of dancers and live music during that time, lots of photo opportunities and just very lively.

CHECK IN WILL INFORM YOU THAT THE ROOMS ARE NOT READY YET AFTER THE 2PM STANDARD CHECK IN TIME, you have to check every after 15minutes. 

And the excuse they will give is that the house keeping have not cleaned my assigned  room. And they know that tourist will be occupying the hotel since its sinulog they should be ready and has a complete and extra staff to make it smooth and fast. But they will always say its not done yet.

The towels are brown color, its harsh on the skin. And has torn parts esp on the edges. Its really horrible!!!
 
And upon check out I accidentally left my card case with all my cards and ID inside, I called the hotel to check if I left something, it took 20mins and no return call from them and I had to call them myself for follow up. And on my 2nd call i was on a 29 mins call with the hotels staff and decided to stay on the line for the feedback from the house keeping, and they said its not in the room. So I decided to ho back to seda and asked the front desk to allow me to go and check myself, ans viola I found it under the folded part of the duvet, and at 2:16pm the room is not even cleaned yet. So it made all sense why the room is not done and ready for the next guest to check it because they are under staffed. 
Overall was horrible experience and will not be coming back ever.

At Misto they keep serving detox water and juice that don't supposed to serve for breakfast.  I see people keep complaining like every single day while we we're there. Staff at misto can't keep up serving drinks to people. I had to ask couple can of juice at Club Lounge for my husband which is quite crazy. Sometimes we rather to eat breakfast at the Club Lounge even they don't have much stuff to chose from but the staff there are very accommodating.   2. At Misto bar there are 2 female staff  by the entrance are keep there eye on us everytime we come to eat for breakfast. We usually come down little after 9am. The lady have a big mole between her lip and nose, and her colleague they kept looking at their wrist watch tapping it seems like we have to get out right after we get our food but yet they're still a lot of people coming down to eat.

Also offered are afternoon tea & coffee treats as well as evening cocktails with appetizers.  Shout out to Seda's GM, Gwen dela Cruz who leads a super service-focused team from Stephen at the Front Desk and the very attentive and efficient Club Lounge gang of Adonis, Michael, Marry & Crystl.

10.0,"I stayed at the Seda Ayala Center Cebu and found it to be extremely pleasant. It was my first business trip to the area. A whitetop taxi cost 500 pesos ($12 USD) to get there from the airport. The hotel has 24-hour security around the perimeter to prevent anyone from wandering in. Inside, it's very clean and well-decorated. There is a lot of staff to greet you and they are very attentive. The room was comfortable and suitable for a person of my height (6'2"" / 1.9m). The Internet connection is stable and worked well for all my conference calls. The breakfast buffet has a lot of options (American, Indian, Asian, & vegetarian). Location wise: there is a very nice indoor shopping mall with everything anyone could need within a few minutes walk. Other destinations are a short drive by taxi/Grab (the local equivalent of Uber). I've already booked my next stay at this hotel.

6.0,"2 main reasons why I did not satisfy our stay in Seda Ayala Center

- Customer service : Very poor
1. At the beginning, our room was not available until I asked for the reason why and told the receptionist that I would wait for the room ready, and it ended up with offering double bed right away after I questioned why it is not available, what if I wait for the double bed room which I booked for, how long it will be etc. It was 3:30 pm to try to check-in with a female receptionist, who has mid-length straight hair style.

The thing is that she should have explained me first why our room is not ready, and have offered me 2 options to choose either I should wait or get a twin bed, instead of simply saying that we have only twin bed room. And I said why, she said rooms are full and I asked again is it because of cleaning? and she said Yes. She said you don't want? and I said Why would I? If so, I should have booked for twin. Very simple! 

During our conversation, she was texting on her WhatsApp and assisting me at the same time. I understand there is no problem with using her own phone as long as she assists their customer properly, but she didn‚Äôt.
No apologies given, No alternative option to choose from the beginning, No proper explanation provided.

2. Secondly I was surprised after she checked my ID and gave me a paper to sign with full of wrong information, including somebody's personal details like phone number, passport number, address, date of birth and etc. I said this is not mine and she said that JUST cross it with the line and put your information. I have never seen to sign with someone‚Äôs booking information mixed with mine over it.

- Room condition - So so, It would be great if there is a window or balcony, but it was ok. Cozy and clean.

- Breakfast (included) - Nice. small restaurant in the lobby area but enjoyed.

The room was quite lovely and has the amenities expected from a topnotch hotel such as Seda: kettle, safe, good toiletries etc. I love the couch by the window and the marble coffee table as well. Breakfast was really good and they have quite a variety  of food choices from local to continental! The staff at the breakfast area were very nice and attentive. Housekeeping was good too. The lobby was lovely and spacious, and impeccably cleaned. I noticed how the housekeeping staff actually meticulously clean the tables at the lobby. Porters/bell service was very good too. It‚Äôs also right next door to Ayala Center, which is just excellent! There‚Äôs a separate pathway to the mall from the hotel. How cool is that? The lifts were also good and fast. The only things I‚Äôd say need improvement are: (1) the coffee in the room: it was poor quality instant coffee in a sachet, which didn‚Äôt taste good, and (2) the sheets still felt a bit damp. It did make my sleep a little less great, but not to the point of it ruining my stay. It wasn‚Äôt due to the cold room as I‚Äôve not had this issue in previous hotels before regardless of cold AC or even during winter season. Drying the sheets better would be great. And (3) the music by the pool was too loud, especially as the staff keeps the door open (probably to keep the DJ feel cool as it is hot outside, though keeping the door open means more energy consumption, which isn‚Äôt very good for the environment and overhead costs). I know I did take the time to point out these 3 issues. Nevertheless, it was a great experience overall, as you can see from the positives I‚Äôve enumerated above. I did have a lovely stay at Seda and would stay there again. I would highly recommend Seda Ayala Center Cebu!

The morning buffet has a great selection - but food temperatures were not good.  Most items warm at best - with some cold.  Very bad for bacterial growth.  
Guests wearing pyjamas should not be allowed in any restaurant - but permitted here.

The TV channel listing in the room was extremely out of date.  I actually went through the entire channels available on the TV and updated the list and provided it to guest services.  Quite a few channels were missing, but I did find three new ones.  Only foreign news channel is CNN.

6.0,"This is probably the third time Ive stayed at this hotel. It's not because I loved my stay but because I always give benefit of the doubt that maybe the hotel will improve i.e. odor will be resolved the next time I stay here. Unfortunately, its just the same everytime. The bathroom wreaked.. the lobby had a musty odor- it is so evident because you can tell the difference when you come from outside or when you come from a very nice smelling hotel like holiday inn.. I paid twice the amount of holiday inn's nightly rate and  i think its just because of location. The buffet was awful. Food wasnt great. coffee was the worst. The muesli I had was spoiled. The food was mediocre.. its very disappointing. The amount you pay for doesnt equate to the quality of goods and hotel they offer to guests. The hotel needs deep cleaning for sure not just externally but internally. 
What I enjoyed during my stay is the service of my housekeeping duo.. Rafgie and Rowell. They were phenomenal. Front Office staff were very welcoming as well as the security. Im usually a fan of  seda but not this particular one :(

7.6,"I first stayed at this hotel some years ago when it was part of the Marriot chain. It seems to have declined a lot since then. But first, there are a number of good things to say about the Seda Ayala: The beds are comfortable, the elevators are quick, there is good hot water in the shower, the buffet breakfasts are quite good, the internet works, and the reception, housekeeping, technical, and restaurant staff are all friendly and efficient. (Mr Steven at reception went out of his way to make up for problems with the hotel which were not of his own making  - he should be a manager one day). However, on the downside: the central air-con system makes the rooms way too cold and there is little one can do to deal with this. Way too cold to be healthy and I had to go and buy extra clothing to survive (my coconut oil turned to a solid in the room). The bathroom is not fantastic: slippery floors, especially in the shower area; bidets were not working (but were promptly fixed when requested). The room itself (Deluxe) was adequate, but a bit drab with depressing, dark, abstract prints, no chairs for the dining table, a very narrow working space, and a smoke detector with a permanent flashing red light beside the bed. From an environmental perspective, little consideration has been given to reducing single-use plastics: the usual suspects are found in the bathroom and with the drinking water. The room service menu is very limited with some items not available. The restaurant is focused on buffet meals and offers little else. The wine selection is limited and not very good quality. Sadly, it seems that the excellent restaurant serving staff does not receive the ""service charges"" that customers are required to pay with their food bills. So, in summary, this hotel is a mixed bag that requires serious attention from the owners to bring it back to at least some of its former glory. For the time being, there is much better value to be had at other venues.

Great food selection in their breakfast buffet. Attentive staffs from Misto restaurant.

We appreciate the hotel gestures as we are celebrating our 3rd year civil wedding anniversary they had prepared a bed set up in the room with a cake. 

Check in was ok. I just had a small issue. The FDA had enrolled me in their Loyalty program without my knowledge. I was a bit upset as she had enrolled my personal email without letting me know. Already spoke to the Duty Manager Karen Ng and she was very accommodating.

If only the FDA introduced their Loyalty program to me properly i would have not say no to it and gave a different email for it. Its just upsetting that she did it without my permission.

The check out was smooth and Stephen was really approachable and smiling. (They‚Äôre wearing face mask but i can tell from his eyes)

Room on 6th floor overlooked The Terraces in Ayala Mall.
Christmas lights/displays on now - nice to see... but the windows are very dirty - even in the restaurant for the breakfast buffet the windows are bad.
Bed comfortable - wifi free - speed poor (5mbps down).  I managed to get 254mbps down on my phone using Globe 5G while in the room.
Breakfast buffet was good... but food temps are too low.  Hottest thing on the buffet were the scrambled eggs.

It could have been one form for both of us right? The restaurant (Misto) - stressful. We ordered chamomile tea but given green tea. That's fine. But during dinner time, I waited 30mins for my order - International Set Menu. And given the wrong main entree. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs with Mango Salsa. But the server brought me Grilled Salmon Fillet. I said no to it. Then she came back saying - it's on the house ma'am as per our chef. I said - sorry, I do not eat Salmon. The food finally arrived after another 30 minutes. With cold rice. I hated to be a pest, but I don't like cold rice either. So I asked for a replacement. So yes, a supposedly enjoyable night with the hubby turned out to be a stressful one. :(  Did not plan on staying longer at the restaurant because I had an early appointment the next morning.

There was a misunderstanding and my parents told the restaurant about it that it was their daughter who booked the hotel for them through Agoda. We had to call the main reception to advise the restaurant about the incident as it was paid and the daily breakfast was for 2pax. It was an awkward scenario since they called out on my parents on the 2nd day already which was a bit embarrassing as they caused an unnecessary panic to my senior parents. The matter was resolved and we understand that it was an honest mistake however, it was completely unnecessary since they didn't double check first given that the guests (both of my parents) were registered and my mom was able to eat breakfast on her 1st day. 

Anyway, it was a nice hotel, spacious and clean with an access to the mall at their back gate.

Using a booking agency to book my visit, I had to change my check in date, instead of being helpful, they just accepted me paying a night I wasn't there. No recourse, they hide behind the booking agency. Then they say they charge 1000 a night, but try to go to the bar at the pool with no cash, nope, you can pay for the room, but not for a beer after swimming. Utter stupidity. Then my daughter must have gotten out one of the waters so when I check out, I got charged for that (no worries, but duh, you couldn't have done that out at the pool bar? Lastly, half the swimming pool is roped off because the overhanging structure that was falling down 3 years ago is still falling down. Definitely the eyesore of the whole place. Smelly elevators (one we started calling the ""pee"" vator) and you have to walk to the lower level to pick up grab and of course the escalator is still broken (I think it was broken 3 years ago). It must be expensive to run the waterfront, but they need a tune up to justify the cost of this once amazing hotel.

Very poorly maintained, old and quite dingy . The armoire that housed the tv was broken, with cracked wood and chipped paint all over. How Housekeeping or Engineering cant see this is beyond me or the hotel does not want to spend the money for repair but a simple paint job would have improved it immensly .. We checked out after 2 days as the water was COLD the entire stay so cold showers were the go and bathroom fixtures were tired and worn. Ordered in the lobby bar what was detailed as Nachos but was just nacho chips and salsa.. Would have been much better to detail as that on the menu to avoid dissapointment . It was around Christmas time we stayed (yes this review is a bit late) and you can see a lot of time and effort was put into the decrations and the large Christmas tree which we must say was excellent and a lot of time, effort & money was put in. ..If half as much effort was put into maintaining the rooms as the public ""SHOW"" areas then the review would be lot better sorry to say.. Also unfortunatley our room was directly overlooking a truck junk yard which in 3 decades of travelling the globe was probably the worst view i have ever had.. While i assume this is out of hotels reach to fix they should at least try and work out something with the owners of the that property to clean it up (maybe a Barter Deal or something similiar ) and at least if you are placed overlooking this shocking view it would have been nice to be  be forewarned or upgraded ..

In front of you, that the receptionist  had to confirm and call their people if there was a dried mango or not in the mini bar. 

It took awhile to confirm and decided to not charge
me and just waived it. She returned still the full 1k security deposit but the receipt that she had me signed was 800 pesos and still in the record there was a charge of 200 pesos for the dried mango which we did not even get from the mini bar. 

There was no true confirmation, it seems like we just waived it but just still sign this receipt. 

I hate it when u are accused
and there
was
no confirmation that it was their facilities who made an incompetency of not refilling their mini bars and resulted in charging customers of a mistake made by their personnel. 

There was not even an apology provided when she returned my full 1k deposit. It seems like she did not believe me as a customer.

4. No bidet
5. Bathroom is not clean enough for 4100 a night room
6. Windows have bird poop

It is not 5 star hotel, too expensive for what it is supposed to worth. For the money being charged, the hotel should do something about the rooms. I don‚Äôt know when was the last time the bed or the carpet has been vacuumed. I am not very sensitive person but the room I stayed it triggered my allergic rhinitis.

Despite my booking specifying a king-size bed, I was provided a smaller size, and the staff did not address this issue satisfactorily when I raised it. The Wi-Fi service was almost non-existent in my room, and the only solution offered was to use the equally poor connection in the lobby.The advertised soundproof rooms were anything but, as I could clearly hear housekeeping staff and other guests in the hallways. Additionally, the lack of a business center and advertised shuttle service to the airport were significant inconveniences, forcing me to print documents at the front desk‚Äîwhere they charged a fee per page‚Äîand arrange my own transportation to the airport.The gym facilities were unsafe; a missing knob replaced with tape on equipment resulted in a minor injury. This lack of attention to detail and the overall management's indifference to resolving issues significantly detracted from the overall quality of my stay.

8.4,"The hotel is impeccably clean. Breakfast buffet was very good with many choices for each type of dish, would recommend. 

The bathroom in our room had a bathtub which was good but no bidet which was bad. The bathtub, however, was smaller than bathtubs in other hotels such as Montebello. The hotel did not immediately provide bathrobes and slippers except by request, and requesting was difficult because the phone lines were down for maintenance.

Wifi was slow and full of restrictions; I was unable to use my Mi Box to watch my streaming services on the TV because of this. 

Staff are generally attentive to customer needs. However, I had one instance where the girl at the FO didn't understand my request for bathrobes and slippers even after I explained that the phone was down for maintenance.

The 4ft-deep pool was wide and nicely placed. The pool area had an unsightly barrier due to some damage or construction on what I assumed was a slide that was situated above the pool.

We attended the New Year's Countdown party and buffet, both of which were not worth the amount paid for (approx ‚Ç±4200 per head for 2 pax or 75 USD) but were otherwise decent.

Overall this is a decent place to stay because of its proximity to Ayala Center and IT Park, but Montebello Hotel which isn't far from here has a better breakfast for less, more expansive hotel grounds and bigger bathtubs in the rooms.

Consider Waterfront over other alternatives if you prefer the ornate decor and furniture of older hotels and want a spot that has good access to many different food places and tourist attractions.

Parking staff and parking security @5pm 12/9 shift: They asked us to inform the concierge to put the validation # for the parking ticket the next time we go out of the hotel or the next day before we check out. Is that how you treat your guests? Or you're just selective based on what type of car your guest is driving? That was not our fault if the validation ticket had the incomplete information!!! Don't ask your guests to do something that could resolve your problem which was only caused by your other staff!!!!! The next day we checked out using the same validation ticket, there was no question about it!!!

This is the second time w/ very consistent concerns! If it was not for the event we were attending, we won't be staying in this hotel again! No wonder you've lost your magic that the people will only book a reservation because it's cheaper than the other better hotel!

one good thing .. they didnt have my room ready for early check in that i asked for .. they wanted me to upgrade my room to get that .. when i complained they had manager change my room to a deluxe which did not seem any different then my original room .. maybe because it was on the 15 floor its deluxe ... was still a basic room ... 

breakfast was definitely downgraded from 2019 .. many things missing .. the scrambled eggs 2 days in a row where empty and not refilled told to go to egg station ... when i only wanted the scrambled and had to wait long time for the egg station to make ...

Since my sister and I just put our bags in the room when we entered, we didn't notice that the A/C was broken.

Their explanation is that, Agoda assigned the booking to another travel booking agency and in the process the freebies and number of booked adults were changed.

In short, we were assigned an old room, with 2 single beds, with old carpet, that smell nauseating and ended up paying for extra for everything.

If you order food from lobby lounge bar, they don't have space to cook so they take food from main resto but fries, they take from Buffett so it's not crispy. 

Gym and pool are good. Gym is old, machines are also but it works fine.

Casino is good but many hookers there with tourists and i know guard cannot stop them because tourists always say she is my wife or girl.

Their tour service is very expensive. 
I booked taxi through hotel to danao port. I paid 3800peso but if you get taxi yourself, it's around 1500-2000peso. But through hotel, you don't need to get stress from negotiations.

When you flush the toilet, it bubbles up a bit (with some splash) before it goes down, and the suction is not good. The shower causes a mess in the bathroom because it's still an old model. There is also no exhaust in the bathroom. The only good thing about this hotel is the staff, i guess. They're very professional and accommodating. I only stayed here because I attended an event. We had no aircon during the whole event so we were dying inside the venue. They said they had a blackout and were only using generators but when we got back in our hotel room, there was aircon so I don't know how true their excuse is. Anyway, if I'm not attending an event here, I definitely would NOT stay here again. Even the lower end hotels have better facilities, and they're much cheaper too.

A few minutes walk will take you to I.T. Park.

Here are some of the but‚Äôs with my experience staying there:

- The internet needs updating and upgrading. Everywhere I am in the hotel, the WiFi keeps cutting off. Something that‚Äôs needs looking into.

- Staff members professionalism. Whilst I find the Receptionist who checked me in very friendly and helpful, I found the staff including the manager on duty somewhat unprofessional. When I was checking out, there was a guest who was charged for smoking in the room. This argument escalated whilst I was being dealt with for check out and this staff member was sounding very patronising to this guest and I actually felt very uncomfortable with the whole conversation considering I was being checked out and I am hearing all of this. I‚Äôm sorry, but the way the staff member spoke to the guest was so patronising. After this argument, I told the Duty manager who check me out that they need to ensure that when they have a dispute with another guest is to set them aside away from the other guest like me. I can tell the Duty manager didn‚Äôt have a care a world with what I said. He just said okay.  Not even an apology was given to me and not acknowledging the fact that it was inappropriate for them to be arguing in front of guests.

I was very put off with how they have been handling these situations. I come from a service background myself, and just found it an uncomfortable experience.

We had to transfer rooms twice; once because our handle for the shower faucet broke and the second time was because the room we transferred to smelled like mildew (almost like wet laundry that hadn‚Äôt dried). They transferred us to new rooms quickly but the fact they even put us in that second room was baffling. I‚Äôd rather stay somewhere that has the common sense to check their rooms before putting people in them.

Our special request was just ignored, receptionists didnt even know about it. They are no longer taking a good care on their hotel guest, they are just focusing on their casinos.

I also left my phone charger at our room, but was told that housekeeping didn't find any or report a lost and found item. I assume, that maybe because it's not a thing of high value.  I wouldn't leave anything behind next time, it may not be found or reported regardless of value or importance.

One shower after me and my taxi driver loaded   the cart. Long line to checkout because they only had two people working the checkout counter.    The first room they gave me AC was broken ,phone had a bad connection,and the toilet didn't stop running after I flushed it. They upgraded the room to room 1410. The shower head was only 5'8"" high. I'm 6'1""  with a bad back and had to bend over to take a shower. Not very comfortable. It was difficult getting into and out of the shower as the bathtub was too high. I felt like I was jumping over a high hurtle. Old folks would have a rough time getting in and out for sure.  Plus the bathroom was small. The room was OK. However, the TV stand was low making it difficult to watch TV while laying on the bed. The room could have used a new paint job.  Location wasn't the greatest. You need to take a taxi to get to a mall or restaurant.  They do offer a shuttle that I took to Ayala Mall that runs at 10 am and will pick you up at 2 pm. I thought that was pretty good.

The staff at the entrance were always helpful. Our room had a very nice view of the mountainous area which looked like it had fairy lights at night. The shower was faulty though. Still, we had a wonderful stay except for what happened during our last night. At around 3am, we heard some banging on the walls and the loud voices of a woman and a man. They were fighting in the hallway. I think the walls weren't thick enough to muffle their voices as I clearly heard what they were fighting about. I don't know who booked the room, but the woman didn't seem to have her key card with her and was begging to be let in. We were quite shaken being awakened at that hour. It continued for a few minutes. I think they resolved their issue in their room as it became quiet after a while. The elevators don't have a card tap system. The hotel is quite safe. But I think having one would increase the hotel's security.

7.6,"We have been frequent customers of Waterfront even as a kid (with parents), my recent stay in Waterfront was with my husband and here's what we observed

A. I appreciate that we were given the option to check in early. Unfortunately, the only available room was twin beds and I didnt want to wait 3 hours to check in. App stated check in time was 2 PM, staff said 3 PM.

B. We checked in around the time others were checking out so I understand the wait. Staff were friendly and accommodating

C. Room was comfortable. The AC worked, we had the hot and cold water option. However, I didnt like that you had to stand in the tub for you to shower. The tub drain looked like it still had some dirt and grime on it. I had to run it under hot water for quite some time. There was no bidet as well. 

D. Their TV definitely needs an upgrade too. Smart TVs are something that they can invest on. The wifi is pretty slow as well. It sucked that they had no slippers for the guests.

E. The bed is very comfortable. We slept really well.

Our overall stay given the price and experience was still good but there definitely is room for improvement. 

Would like to share one thing. Around 3 AM, someone knocked on our door. We were in the 3rd floor and we were woken up by someone knocking on our door. My husband asked who it was and the person on the other side replied, ""Nag room check ra mi, Sir.""

We're unsure if the said person was a legitimate employee or if otherwise. It still boggles me until this day who was on the other side as we were not expecting guests nor did we request for any service or housekeeping. Weird. Waterfront can maybe check out the footage and check who was knocking.

I made the complaint and a young lady Manageress named ZEA or something like that took my complaint on board, waited until we left and then skipped it.

8.8,"We have stayed regularly at Waterfront over the last 10 years except for during 2020 and 2021 due to covid.
Generally, everything was very good as expected from previous stays, however I make the following observations:
The pool area needs an upgrade, especially exposed drainage channels with green algae.
I do like a cup of  English Breakfast tea with breakfast. Waterfront Uno restaurant provides EB tea in a large teapot on  a warming appliance.
Trouble is getting a decent cup of tea from that big pot is hit and miss as as it depends how long the teapot has been there.
After two days of luke warm cups of tea this time, I asked a waiter for a pot of tea to my table please.
The waiter replied, that will be an extra charge Sir. I said how long have you been working here? Waiter replied 2 months. Well I said I've been coming here for 10 years and never been charged for a pot of tea before.
From then on subsequent mornings waiters sometimes delivered freshly brewed pots of tea to my table without me asking, no extra charge.
But I found another way to get around it.  I simply took a  tea bag each day  to breakfast and went to the drink bar and asked for boiling water in my cup. Simple, no dramas.
The restaurant staff probably think asking for a pot of tea at your table is asking for special service.
No it's not. I simply wanted a decent cup of tea.  The general tea pot that could be there for 15, 30 minutes or more does not provide a decent cup of tea.
All other hotels I've stayed at provide an urn with boiling water and tea bags. You make your own. No special treatment, no dramas and you are assured of getting a decent cup of tea every time.
Why doesn‚Äôt Waterfront do this?

Easy and fast check in, followed agoda's booking instructions. 

My dad loved the breakfast they offered.

Bad points:

No valet readily available. Staff is either absent or unavailable. We have to request for a bellboy or valet to help us with our luggages.

Being a four star hotel, this should be readily available. Guests are left to find for staffs that would accommodate their luggages.

Rude telephone services staff.  A male voice, I requested for late check out but I was answered with a direct response. No thank yous, no good morning. It seems like he can't be bothered by my request. I was appalled by that demeanor.

No available benches in the lobby. All the chairs are reserved for dining customers only. Talking about unwelcoming lobby. At least put a bench near the entrance so that guests like me can readily sit while waiting for our lift. Take note, I have a toddler with me.

It's quite expensive for that service compared to other four star hotels. The decors and the hotel itself is outdated.

I hope the service will improve.

Check out at 5:00 a.m. only one staff, and they need to check the room before to give you the authorization to leave the hotel, time consuming when you have a flight to take.
The room looks like an old Las Vegas hotel with the wood furniture in bad condition.
The shower head must be 1.70 m high, I am 1.90.
The amenities are plastic and contaminating the environment.
The air conditioning control was not working and blocked at the coldest temperature. The only possible control was on the fan strength or turning the air con off. 
I ordered two shakes and a pizza for a quick snack, the shakes arrive in minutes and the pizza took more than half an hour to be served. 
In the afternoon impossible to nap as the staff was very noisy in the corridor, talking very loud. 
The flooring around the pool is really cheap and not friendly.
It's a large hotel with a glamor reception and and hugh hall, with a lot of traffic. 
It could be a nice experience after a full refurbishment and a better management.
Tye staff is always very nice at every interaction which is general in the country.

When I said we did check in, then he asked for the validation rudely again, then I told him I didn't know because majority of the hotels we did stay at were not asking for anything upon the parking exit. Selective waiters because they did not gave us water unlike other tables beside us not until we proactively asked for it! We will never stay there again.

3.0,"I hate to say but our recent stay was quite disappointing. We have been choosing this hotel for the past five years, consistently booking the same one-bedroom executive suite at approximately $180 per night. At this rate, we expect excellent service. Unfortunately, my fianc√© and I were very dissatisfied this time.
Compared to our previous stays, numerous aspects have declined, including the breakfast experience. While I understand the increase in guests, it is disheartening that they no longer serve water or coffee at the table. Instead, we had to walk to the refreshment station for a single glass of water. There were no placemats, and it was challenging to find staff for assistance. Such basic courtesies are typically upheld even by smaller hotels. After that, we avoided the breakfast buffet for the remainder of our stay, opting to order from our room instead, which felt both sad and wasteful.
Also, the lounge's alcohol selection was subpar, much to my fianc√©'s displeasure, and the food choices were minimal and repetitive.

We stayed for four nights and aimed to salvage the rest of our trip. Fortunately, the food was excellent, especially the Indian cuisine. Kudos to the chef for the authentic taste! The roof deck bar was a highlight, with attentive and entertaining staff, particularly Rica and Jennecil. Maira, Kent, and Aris were also very accommodating to my friends. Despite the overall disappointment, their hospitality made our time enjoyable.
Special thanks to Janry, Marden, and Don from the lounge for ensuring we received the service we needed. Their efforts were the main reason our stay was tolerable. But after this experience, we're not sure if we'll come back. It's sad, given our years of loyalty, but we hope things improve in the future.",0.5

However, we encountered a minor issue at the Pool Bar. When we asked for the bill, the waiter mistakenly charged our bank card without letting us check the receipt first. It turned out we paid for another table's order, nearly doubling our amount. Thankfully, they voided the charge after we pointed out the mistake, but it should not have happened in the first place. The staff should ensure the correct bill is presented and confirmed before charging.

4.0,"Bai Hotel is an upper end experience compared to many other hotels in the area and in the Philippines. My wife and I have stayed at countless hotels all over Canada and the U.S., and Bai Hotel is definitely an easy recommendation if you just want a more high end stay. I look forward to hopefully seeing the hotel improve their elevator access to the underground parking instead of having to walk through a busy vehicle courtyard. It would also make it easier for us to return more frequently if there is a pet hotel service. Nonetheless, Bai Hotel is great and we will be back. Shout out to Chloe and Khino for their friendly and welcoming demeanor during the check-in process. With all the many amenities and benefits that Bai Hotel offers, it's the quality of service that will ensure their success. Chloe and Khino represented their organization very well, and so did all the staff we encountered and observed. We look forward to the same or even better experience in the future!

5.0,"I‚Äôve been traveling around the world for well over 50 years. Whether it be North America, South America, Asia, Australia, or Europe I have never found a more welcoming hotel than the bai Hotel in Cebu. The accommodations were incredible. Where do I start?  The room/bed was so comfortable with luxurious sheets and pillows, the A/C was top notch and easily controllable, the TV was huge and crystal clear, the complimentary water restocked everyday, turn down bedding with snacks, and the most wonderful rain shower ever. The rooftop pool was a delight and the bar with food service is incredibly delicious. The prices for everything were more than fair and for a New Yorker like myself cheap. I must stop and take a moment to comment on the breakfast buffet which whenever possible I opt for. If you do stay here I highly recommended you include this when you book. I once stayed at a hotel in Iceland which I thought was a phenomenal buffet breakfast until I came to the bai. My words cannot do it justice so you can take my word for it (or not) but I challenge you to find one better. I know you won‚Äôt. If I have the opportunity I‚Äôll post some pics of the breakfast here. But the over all best part of our six night stay were the staff. Everyone from the checkin desk to checking out was the most helpful people I ever came across. Their service was fast and courteous. Everyone couldn‚Äôt have been better.

5.0,"Bai Hotel was nice, and I would definitely stay there again. I chose it as it is close to the airport for a late arrival and early departure a few days later. The taxi rides were both quick and under 200php. 
The room was clean (although a few hairs in the bathroom) and well-equipped. The bed was quite hard but the bedding was very comfortable, so I slept really well.  Toiletries were provided but in large containers.  Robes were available upon request and slippers were in the room.  I especially appreciated the loofa to scrub away the sun cream. Two water bottles were provided daily.
The Park Mall had a small grocery but otherwise was very underwhelming. However it was a very short taxi trip to Alaya Mall. 
The rooftop was nice for city views and a cocktail. I had a pizza at the restaurant after asking if I could take half away for the morning. They said yes, but then when it came to packing it up, were quite difficult. Then, I discovered the fridge in the room was not cold, something they should have told me at the start. This was the only negative but was disappointing as only bought the pizza to have half later.
The coffee shop was nice and had a delicious croissant. 
The staff were all so lovely and genuinely welcoming. The concierge were especially AMAZING! After my driver for a day trip pulled out last minute in the evening before, they spent time finding me a replacement for the same price. Thank you Andrei and John Fred!!!",1.0

I thought this was a one of mistake but I have made a future booking again for August and again the hotel has tried to charge me for another 2 breakfast s. The breakfast charge is P1288 (US $33 ) per person which is expensive for the Philippines. I spend 6 out 12 months a year living in the Philippines.

From the delectable Grilled Peruvian Pork Chop to the succulent 48-hour slow braised Wagyu beef ribs, every bite was a symphony of flavors. Recommended by the gracious Chef Jake, the meal was elevated to perfection.
Kudos to the talented kitchen assistants Melbert, Jose, and Rosebello for their culinary expertise, Ranyl, Dwayne and Sir Keith's impeccable service truly enhanced our dining experience. And let's not forget Sir Geo, the masterful bartender who crafted our delightful drinks. It was a night to remember, especially as we bid farewell to our beloved sister returning to Belgium.
The Pana Cotta and Espresso Mousse were the cherry on top of an already exquisite evening.

I would especially like to give kudos our server, Roxanne, who was very attentive from the moment we sat down to when we were eating our dessert.

Roxanne asked my mother if she would like to have some dessert and my mother said she was just waiting for me to return so she can get her fruits. A few minutes later Roxanne came back with some ripe mangoes for my mother! 

Bai Cafe is a buffet restaurant, servers are not expected to get food for patrons. Roxanne went above and beyond her job to help a senior citizen have a more enjoyable meal. I will never forget the kindness she has shown my mother!

2.0,"During my five-night stay at the hotel, I encountered numerous issues that significantly detracted from the overall experience. The trouble began during check-in when the receptionist, Marjorie, claimed that none of my pre-noted requests for a Harbor View Room on a higher level could be accommodated due to apparent lack of availability. Despite my prior communication and assurance from a representative, Marjorie only fulfilled my request when I expressed frustration in front of other waiting guests.

The problems continued during check-out, where a pre-arranged late check-out was seemingly disregarded. Despite confirming a late departure and agreeing to associated charges, the housekeeping staff interrupted my rest at 11 am, insisting on a 12 pm check-out. To exacerbate matters, upon returning from lunch at 1 pm, I discovered that my room key cards had been deactivated, preventing access despite notifying the front desk of a planned 3 pm check-out.

These incidents collectively indicate a disorganized check-in/check-out process, poor communication within the staff, and an overall lack of coordination. Such shortcomings significantly marred my experience, raising concerns about the hotel's operational efficiency and customer service standards.",0.25

With a family that strictly adheres to an Islamic diet, I have longed to bring them to Cebu. However, most restaurants and establishments primarily feature menus with pork content, which has been a setback for me.

The beds so comfortable, roof top pool facilities and view really pleasant . But the staff and buffet breakfast are the stand out performers.
All the managers made themselfs known to me . On this trip I have cancelled further Cebu hotel stays so I can go back to the bai in 2 days and again in 2 weeks .
I would always stay in the bai in the future . 
The bai is much better than the Mayo , Dunsit Thai in my opinion

3.0,"This review is based on my recent experience. We stayed at Bai Hotel for 2 nights prior heading to Boracay. 

The staffs were all wonderful, kind and very accommodating. The breakfast buffet was great as well. The reason why I only gave 3 stars was because the bed and pillows were very uncomfortable. 

The Bed - so hard that it gave me body ache upon getting up the following day. I had to get up early cause I couldn‚Äôt stayed any much longer in bed. It was so hard that it‚Äôll give you so much sore. Not relaxing at all. 

Pillows - it was not as soft as usual pillows you see in a high end hotels. The pillows were flat and plastic feel. There is no comfort touch that will make you wanna go to bed and relax.",0.5

The first night we were meant to go out for dinner but after a tour of the buffet we couldn‚Äôt help but stay and indulge in the varied cuisine. Personally I loved the sushi and sashimi, a cheese platter and tasted bits from all the different stations. We loved the fresh fruit and vegetables too and the desserts were a hit with the kids! My husband liked the roast and vegetables. 
We went again the second night because it was so easy and were hosted by Princess who was so attentive all while attending to her other duties. We appreciate the effort to get our young daughter the scrambled eggs she was asking for, even though it wasn‚Äôt on the dinner buffet menu! Salamat po!
We‚Äôve found the staff in the hotel so friendly and engaging. The concierge was very helpful in booking a tour for my mother in law.

2.0,"Being a hotelier for the last 10 years driving guest experience, i do have an understanding of how a hotel operates. I just checked in with Nina, friendly yet she lacked many aspects of what Hoteliers should do but for some reason I understand, I booked through Agoda, a deluxe room for two with a request for a large bed. Upon arrival I was told there was no request, and yet when I told her I requested for a large bed, she proceeded and said - it's subject to availability. Unfortunately, hotels gives the lowest category to their guests booked thru OTAs. But on many occasions, hotels do find ways. 

Now, here's what Nina failed to do 1/Apologize that I am unhappy with room choice I am getting because accordingly that's what's available 2/Offer alternatives such as combine the twin bed! It takes 5minutes for a room attendant to do this change 3/offer a paid upgrade for a higher room category 4/inform me of the hotel facilities, she didn't even mention where breakfast is but has reminded me that since I have deposit everything will be billed to the roon 5/to make matters worst, she ended my check in wishing me to ""enjoy your stay"" which I clearly won't.

I would have settled for this room if I felt cared for, some level of empathy or some lip service that if a room with large bed will be available she would inform me so a room move could be made, also offer me some options etc. So much for expecting a hotel in the heart of cebu to deliver. Or maybe, I should have lowered my expectations or better just stayed elsewhere.

There is a mall just across the street and it‚Äôs very walkable. My room was spacious and conveniently located on the same floor as the pool deck. Many people made sure I was well taken care of but Christian and Ferlyn at the Bai Cafe were great help every day at breakfast. They knew my name and warmly greeted me every day.

5.0,"At first, we planned to stay at Bai Hotel only for 2 nights but decided to extend our stay longer because of the kind and nice people working at the Hotel. Especially, we wanted to appreciate and mention some people. First, Chloe, a receptionist at the, kindly helped us to plan our tour to Oslob and extending a night in the same room. Rica Mae, a waitress at the rooftop bar, provided the best recommendation on food and drinks and kept us in being taken care of. Queen, a receptionist on 21st floor, always welcomed us with a beautiful smile even when we bothered her with small talks and jokes. Franz and Cedric, on the first floor, always helped us to get a taxi and took care of our stuffs so we do not lose anything. Jasmine, a cleaner on the 15th floor, always kindly talked and helped us to clean the room perfectly. Jake always did good job with delivery food to our room. Because of the people working at Bai Hotel, we strongly recommend everyone to stay at this hotel when you come to Cebu. Nice room, beautiful view, good food and drinks will make your life happy. We literally just stayed at hotel without doing any activities until the last day, but we are still so happy. We are definitely staying again next year to say Hi to the people.

2.0,"Receptionists at check in and check out were friendly, talkative, and welcoming. The room is spacious, clean, with a great view. Everything was going quite smoothly until we went for breakfast. We called ahead the night before to inquire about protocols for bringing guests. We were informed about the charges. When we asked about the possibility of reserving a table, we were told tables are on a first come first served basis. When we arrived to the buffet, we picked a free table with no ""occupied"" sign on it for our party. The hostess insisted the table is occupied even though there were no signs on it that say it is. We kept asking where are the guests that are seated at the table, instead of answering us the hostess decided to put the ""occupied"" sign on the table right in front of us. To avoid further arguments, we found 2 separate tables nearby and asked if they could be put together so we have one large table. About 4 staff members stared at each other instead or assisting us, leaving us no choice but to move the tables and add chairs ourselves. This whole encounter made us and our guests feel unwelcome and the way the staff handled the situation was disappointing. 
Once we got the tables together, we went to the buffet, where the cherry on top of this disastrous experience was found. At the tea selection and coffee station, there was a cockroach roaming around freely. I fled the premise and went back to my table, no food in hand. I found another cockroach roaming on the floor around our table. I lost my appetite wondering about the cleanliness of the food and whether or not the kitchen is infested with more cockroaches. When we left the premise, I checked the table we originally wanted, only to find that it remained empty, with the solitary occupied sign on it. This was very disappointing, if tables are indeed first come first served, then why was this table reserved the whole time for guests that never showed up?

Overall, the diversity of the food at the buffet was met by equally diverse disappointments of unprofessionalism and lack of proper sanitation. ",0.25

1.0,"Overall, I must say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and accommodating. They were always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests I had during my stay.

However, I must express my disappointment regarding a couple of issues I encountered. Firstly, there was a persistent moldy smell in the floor hallway, which was quite unpleasant. It made me feel uncomfortable and concerned about the general cleanliness of the hotel.

Additionally, the air conditioning in my room was extremely loud, making it difficult to have a peaceful and relaxing night's sleep. The constant noise was quite bothersome and affected my overall experience at the hotel.

On a more positive note, I found the breakfast buffet to be quite enjoyable. There was a good selection of food available, and I appreciated the variety of options to choose from. It was a pleasant start to the day.

Unfortunately, my stay took a turn for the worse when I woke up with insect bites that resembled bed bug bites. Naturally, I was alarmed and immediately went to the management to request a thorough checking of my room. I expressed my concern about the possibility of my belongings getting infested if there were indeed bed bugs present. The management conducted an inspection, but they confirmed that they couldn't find any evidence of bed bugs.

While I am relieved that there were no bed bugs, I must admit that I am quite upset about the itchy bites I experienced. It has affected my overall satisfaction with my stay at Bai Hotel and left me feeling saddened by the whole ordeal.

I hope this feedback can be taken constructively and used to improve the overall experience for future guests. I genuinely believe that with some attention to these issues, Bai Hotel has the potential to provide an even better stay for its guests.",0.0

While I really appreciate and impressed on every hotel that includes practices to save the environment, I think BAI went overboard by providing only bath towels in the room and one has to call housekeeping for hand and face towels.  I think Bai should already provide the hand and face towels outright.  Those are the basics.

5.0,"This was our second stay. On the 1st stay there was a minor emergency and the Assistant Manager Roy Saloman was able to control the situation and get me safely and get me somewhere I could recover quietly. On this trip not only did he remember me but also remembered my situation. He made sure the Head Manager Maricel knew of my situation and she made sure a table was reserved for me that I was comfortable with and could enjoy my breakfast.
 On the second night we went to the ""Marble and Grain"" the steakhouse, and my girlfriends birthday. Roy was there and I can only assume he let the staff know about us. The Head chef came out and spoke with us, talked about our steaks and sauces, laughed and joked with us as they all did. Eme and Geo did an absolutely fantastic job of making our dinner one my girlfriend won't forget anytime soon. I would say the prices are on a par or a little lower than normal hotel restaurants. You defiantly get what you pay for. Not once have I felt cheated or taken advantage of.
The next night we went to ""Ume"" the Japanese restaurant. If you don't know anything about Japanese food like we didn't, don't be intimidated. Our server Nelmore did an excellent job of explaining the choices. Another great meal was had. 
The hotel its self is wonderful, clean and modern. The staff is impeccable, knowledgeable friendly and always with a good morning/afternoon/evening. Without a doubt this is my new home in Cebu. I'm looking forward to our next stay.",1.0

As you can see from the video, staff don‚Äôt seem to be bothered that kids are running around the bar/ lounge area screaming and running under tables for the last hour. I‚Äôve complained to front desk and they done nothing to calm the situation down.

The bedrooms are nice but the beds are rock hard, sleeping here with a injury has been a difficulty.

5 star hotel which wasn‚Äôt cheap and very disappointing. Step up your game staff!

Update & downgrade ‚ùå This place is an absolute shambles. Yes, the staff are all so sweet and nice but there is just no authority here. We ended up leaving the lounge at 8pm due to 2+ hours of kids yelling and we ended up eating dinner in our room. The manager came to our room as requested and what was done? NOTHING.

However, we had a flight to catch at 3pm so went into Cebu City to explore early in the morning. After returning at 11.30am and asking can we use the pool for 1 hour before we go to the airport we were told because we were already checked out on the system we would have to pay 600php per person to use it. I think this is a bit of a joke considering we had stayed for several nights and paid a considerable amount of money. Any hotel I've stayed in in the past has been happy to let you use the pool area the day of check in/check out. 

Really left a sour taste, would not stay here again. ",0.5

3.0,"I gave Bai Hotel Cebu 3 stars due to the disappointing room conditions during my recent stay, despite the friendly staff. The rooms need improvement. The water pressure was very low, making showers difficult. The towels felt like sandpaper on my skin, not soft and plush as expected at a hotel. The air conditioner struggled to keep the room cool in the tropical heat. With only one outlet in the entire room, there was nowhere to plug in devices near the beds, just some exposed wires sticking out of holes in the walls. For a hotel that is only around 5 years old, these infrastructure issues were surprising. There was also mildew building up in the shower area. The staff were very nice and apologetic about the issues, but the hotel rooms themselves need maintenance and renovation. With some improvements to the rooms, Bai Hotel Cebu would be worthy of a higher rating. I hope they can upgrade the amenities to match their excellent service. But for now, the disappointing room conditions bring this hotel down to 3 stars.",0.5

Very accommodating from phone and face to face interactions - very much impressed and grateful. 
After a long commute, the porters and graveyard attendees were highly welcoming and authentically helpful. Just a couple of hours in and everyone‚Äôs been so lovely at every department from their cafe to their pool bar - spectacular views btw, unbelievable and proud to see my hometown flourishing. 

Been recommended by mother dearest and it‚Äôs safe to say Bai sticks to its roots with it being family friendly and all round inclusive from their food variety and heartwarming professionalism to each guest they come across. Modern amenities adaptable to both locals and foreigners is great and I highly recommend. Also just across Parkmall so that‚Äôs a plus. 

Mum and I both having hospitality background have a special eye for what we know is good service, and no there are no words to express how much they go beyond that. Our room was clean and comfortable and the attention to detail and fast service is rare to come by so if quality service is what you‚Äôre looking for and inevitably more, Bai Hotel doesn‚Äôt disappoint as they tick every box. 

Extending my special gratitude and appreciation to Ray‚Äôs compassion at midnight over the phone who helped get my booking all in order before arrival. Gian‚Äôs warm and kind welcome upon check in were outstanding, even went to go out of his way to check how everything was in the room once we‚Äôve settled was unexpected but it was another cherry on top. The porter‚Äôs which I didn‚Äôt get their names should never be left unappreciated as their strong and lively aid is what makes the first impression worth while - purely stunning. Archie‚Äôs politeness and considerate source of info in the cafe made it concrete that it was good to be back home again. Thanks to Khino‚Äôs lovely assistance at the front desk for attending a request I had so quickly even though it wasn‚Äôt urgent whatsoever - grand top to bottom and all round.

Spa massage is alright.
Joy from the Twilight bar is the best of all -  her lovely smile and very friendly approach makes the experience more amazing (of course, all the waiters there are to be praised too).
Drinks in the bar are to go for.
Cons - water is not good, and they don‚Äôt offer drinking glass water in the bar too.

3.0,"The best thing about using Bai Hotel as a venue for official functions is the Banquet Service and Facilities, and Cafe Bai Service and Food. The front office and the rooms are a different story. They‚Äôll need to improve the tangibles and the service in order to merit thumbs up. 
The Banquet Facilities are good. Spacious and cool. Well set-up. With great technical support from engineering (special mention Marlon - he is technically competent, pleasant, prompt). Banquet Service is excellent. The service team is punctual, courteous, pleasant, personable and responsive. Special mention must be made of Quin, Edmar and Clark. They anticipate what you need, they are fast. They give Bai a very good name. They MUST be recognized and commended internally!
Cafe Bai food is hands down the BEST! The quality is great! The variety is great! And most of all, the F&B staff do their job Very Well! Maricel Newman leads them very well! She is experienced and sets a very good example. The rest of her team is equally as good! Rowel, Rachel, Lenie - they all have smiling welcome expressions consistently, they serve very well. Like the banquet staff, they are swift, responsive and they anticipate and think of what you need even before you ask. They MUST be recognized and commended internally as well!
The front office and the rooms division - they have a lot of work to do to catch up. The front office (next to the guards and bellman) is the first encounter you have with the hotel. And unfortunately, they‚Äôre not consistently good. Sometimes you meet someone who‚Äôs competent and who knows his/her job, most of the time you are handled by personnel who give the vibe of being unsure. They‚Äôre not sharp nor fast. You‚Äôll need to wait your turn most of the time. Their turnaround time could be faster. As for the rooms? Very inconsistent. You get rooms that are ok. They give you welcome pastries or drinks, you are welcomed with your name on the screen and in cards addressed to you personally, you have complete amenities and everything works. But at other times (this last trip was one for the books!), you get a really bad experience: no more welcome pastries (they call the next day and say sorry they forgot) AND the TV doesn‚Äôt work (housekeeping looks at it, is helpless, so calls IT and IT fixes it - supposedly! - and assures you it‚Äôs ok, and then it bogs down again). They transfer you to another room (because you repeatedly complain) - but in that next room, you face a TV that works tbf (but it uses ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù and hieroglyphics for you to understand how it works - it‚Äôs customer unfriendly! - they acknowledge and explain that they upgraded the TV but still use the old remote so it‚Äôs hard to use). The new room you‚Äôre transferred to does not have hot water (faucet on the sink) and is dirty (the housekeeping did not see the dirt (a used plastic they must have overlooked below the mirror near the sink). The door jamb is also stuck all the time. The pillows are not as soft. Sigh. The duty manager comes to you and apologizes profusely and does what he can to pacify you. The question is: why put yourself in a position where an apology is needed? If the front office and rooms division can look into their tangibles and can do their job as well as F&B does, they‚Äôll definitely merit two thumbs up and more.",0.5

We asked for a change and got two options, where both rooms had a little less mold. After we complained to the booking company they called us in the middle of the night and said they had a new room. We were already sleeping. The next day we were all coughing. We cancelled our day 2 stay. and booked another hotel.",0.0

Billing experience terrible. No Aircon in public areas (reception and hallways). Room charge not available or not asked for during check in. 
Late check out to 3 PM offered due to slow check-in process, but key cards not valid more than to 12 noon meaning queueing up during checkout time to extend the keycards. All in all a terrible 5-star experience. Will NOT recommend to spend money there. Nice staff crippled by stupid regulations.",0.25

5.0,"I highly commend the best-service professionalism of the supervisor in welcome desk for assisting me all the way. Her name is VENUS, forgot the full name, but her name will forever be remarkable to us. She's a gem!

I had a lot of experiences at this hotel. When I first arrived, I was impressed by the tight security procedures when my taxi was stopped, Also, my luggage went through an X-ray machine. The concierge are very welcoming and the ladies with teal long gown assisted me going to check-in counter and entertained my son.
I had no reservation, Venus happily assisted me.

My first room was on the lower floor with no view, and you could hear families walking by. After few minutes someone from the customer service called to check on me, told her my concerns: I have senior citizen mother coming late evening and the room is small plus no view at all, Venus immediately responded and assisted me for room transfer. I was upgraded to the top floor, which was the suite, and a very comfy-accessible room for my mom because its near lift and I got an ocean-view room. The room was very quiet, and enjoyed watching the sunset.

The buffet restaurant had a fantastic breakfast. We used the spa for massages which were top-notch. Once you get to this hotel, there is no need to go anywhere for the rest of your vacation or business trip.

Lastly, would like to give a tap on the back of all your staff esp. the hotel manager for a job well-done! Everything is well managed and organised. We can really see they trained and choose their staff well. Keep up your outstanding and phenomenal customer service ever.

Please, I will definitely come back.",1.0

You will not get bored staying here since they have plenty of restaurants to try to and also they're located close to the big malls in the City. We tried most of their restaurants like Cafe Bai, Marble and Grain, Ume and Pool Bar and it didn't disappoint me since all of them serve mouth watering dishes.

We had an issue with our sink but it was immediately handled by Mr. Barriga from housekeeping. Mr. Barriga and his housekeeping team also made sure that we had everything we needed during our stay. 

The King size bed has great fit/quality for foreigners or taller people. 

The breakfast buffet has a lot of choices and always fully stocked and not to mentioned, tasty. 

We tried the Marble and Grains restaurant, the servers were very attentive but a few issues overall. 1. The cheese and meat boards took over 30 mins and was served later after we had our soup (it was disappointing) the rest of the meal was great. 
It's a nice restaurant but some guests are so rude to have their phone blasting on loud speaker while dining not everyone wants to hear somebody else's conversation. 

Also visited the Twilight bar, our server Almar was great. We had some questions about the place and the surrounding properties and he answer it all politely more like we are talking to a friend.

We contacted them through booking.com messaging that it may have fallen in the hallway as my daughter and hubby were chasing each other after breakfast. They did a search and found it. Through an App in the iPad, my hubby indicated that the device is lost and to contact a number if found. This allowed them to contact me and we returned to the hotel after flight check in to retrieve the phone!

3.0,"Pros:
- concierge is superb and attentive -- one of them even remembered the taxi company we used the first 2 days even with the weekend guest influx that they had - mind blowing in a great way!
- must hangout at the pool bar --- I enjoyed the view and the food/drink service provided
- one of the best halo-halo (especially the leche flan and ube) I've tasted since I've been in the country for almost 2 weeks.
- bed was a little too firm but the pillows were comfortable that suprisingly I didn't have any neck/back aches after waking up.

Cons:
- the dressed up lady greeters are more attentive and bubbly IF you are a guy and looks more foreigner... ü§£
- no welcome drink or complimentary water or coffee in the lobby even if you're in a long wait for check-in.
- there's a baby cockroach in my room ü§Æ my 1st night
- unpleasant view in the immediate surroundings of the hotel on 2 sides (we got 2 rooms across each other) but can get a view of the mountain on one and a bit of the water on the other.
- although they have full bathroom amenities (dental kit, shower cap, shaving, sanitary bag), they do not provide shampoo, conditioner, and lotion
- hair dryer is a so-so.... and I have to untangle the cord myself üòî
- they also do not provide hand towels and face towels on their deluxe rooms--- seriously?ü§Ø --- but they did provide both when I asked for it.
- walls are thin.... I can seriously hear the conversations of the guests in the next room.",0.5

2.0,"Bai Hotel is NOT Cebu's best foot forward.  The food at Cafe Bai is mid at best.  The staff at the action station are always nowhere to be found, and the refills come at a snail's pace.  The Japanese restaurant, Ume is nothing to write home about either.  They claim that they have a Japanese chef on board but nothing about the food tastes authentic.  The rice was not even Japanese rice and the ramen was not savory.  This coming from a restaurant that charges PHP600 on average per dish.  The beds are hard.  Someone comes to knock at your door early in the morning to confirm if you are indeed checking out.  They could have just slipped a letter under the door or better just wait for their guests to come down or inform them of any changes in the booking plan.  They charge PhP50 per bucket of ice requested for your room, something that bigger and better hotels don't do.  Overall,  It's a NO and a HARD PASS for as long as there are other options.",0.25

Had one of the best steaks of my life at Marble and Grain Steakhouse (250g porterhouse) with the most wonderful staff. Everyone‚Äôs so nice! 

Fully recommend, especially for Americans as this hotel has all the amenities you‚Äôd find in a hotel in the states, plus more. Complimentary shaving, dental, and hygiene kits in the bathrooms make my life easy. I asked for sheets for the sofa bed and they came and made the bed for me complimentarily! 

I‚Äôve also visited their infinity pools and bar at the roof. I had a ‚Äúsex on the beach‚Äù and a ‚Äúclover club‚Äù and oh my god, the mixologist is magic. So good I got a little drunk on accident. Their pool bathrooms even have complimentary body wash and shampoo! That with the robes they provide, it‚Äôs a recipe for relaxation.

The only ‚Äú‚Äúdownside‚Äù‚Äù I‚Äôve seen is the shower would sometimes go cold for a few seconds, but every hotel I‚Äôve stayed at in the Philippines has had the exact same issue, so I‚Äôm not upset at all. 

What really sealed my happiness for this hotel had to be the concierge who remembered us when we came back for our return overnight layover.

5.0,"My husband and I attended a wedding here and we booked a suite room, which was also the kind of room we stayed in during the pandemic as this hotel was our ""quarantine hotel"" where we stayed separately for 7-10 days (we flew separately w different incoming flights from the US). The service then was as it was during our recent stay- we were so glad to be able to enjoy the big room together this time. 

The staff are all very friendly and I have to mention how one of them went out of his way to make sure I got to the airport on time despite the ridiculous traffic (the bridge to the airport was closed that morning due to an accident), who had my bags brought to the check-in counter while I had gone ahead sprinting to the counter. It was also my birthday and instead of being a very lonely one, they gave me a cake. 

Then, and during this recent visit,  the staff were very friendly and attentive. 

We missed the mad scramble for the breakfast buffet by going as late as we could (past 9am). 

Unfortunately we weren't able to check out their facilities. I had a ramen lunch at Ume and it was served as fast as I requested. 

Will definitely stay here again.",1.0

They employ (very attractive IMHO) greeters who assist with getting you situated. Unique and welcome. Pool was v nice.

the only issue is location it's just outside the main city and nothing much nearby so we used alot of taxis but there is park mall next door to buy any groceries. 
we had a perfect vacation visiting family in Cebu",1.0
2.0,"Cons
- Rooms are full of mold. I am saying rooms because as soon as we entered to our room I could clearly smell mold. Asked to change it but they sent staff with spray air freshener. I explained that it wont change situation so they moved me to a new room which had a same issue. Smelled awfully moldy, made me sneeze and cough all the time. You can see wallpapers have yellowish spots, bathroom ceiling which indicates mold is under it and on tiles. Very bad for your health especially if you consider to stay more than a night 
- No spa. I asked if there is spa, staff guided that there is so I made a reservation. However apparently there is no spa, and therapist comes to room. Cancelled because did not want oily sheets and neck aching after having massage in pillow.
- Location. Nothing around, mall across the street is not worth even to look. No restaurants around
- View from room is terrible. Container yard.

Pro
- Close to airport. 20min ride 290peso
- Room itself looks neat, modern and clean (except hidden mold)
- Nice night view from pool on the roof
- Very welcoming and friendly staff
- Fast wifi available at all points of hotel",0.25

With the recent shut down of Philippine airspace and all flights being cancelled or delayed, and our plane's arrival at 4 am (over 26 hours after our scheduled arrival), we were taken very good care of, offered a really late check out of 2 pm, and were given a good room with a nice view. There was also a buffet breakfast offered! Everyone was extremely pleasant, even the concierge that helped us get transportation to our next destination of Moalboal. My recommendation is to have a local phone number to be able to get in contact with the Hotel for any emergencies or issues, as email communications were slow, almost non existent.",0.75

3.0,"One night stay at a junior suite. Room was quite nice overall. The room had four distinct areas - a living area, small utility kitchen, the bedroom proper and the toilet. Interior design was contemporary and generally pleasing to the eye. The bathroom was probably my least favorite space because it‚Äôs tiny compared to the rest of the room. I would have gladly accepted a smaller utility kitchen for a larger bathroom. Everything in the room worked. I had two TVs, one in the living area, the other in the bedroom. Both were HD (at least), sufficiently large and up to date. The bed was king sized. The mattress was firm but not hard. There was little in the way of stationary or pens in the room though and I couldn‚Äôt get the WiFi to work. However, I didn‚Äôt call it in.

For a nice little touch, J received a welcome pastry from the hotel. The pastry was only okay.

The breakfast buffet looked good. However, because the space got so full and crowded so quickly, I sort of lost my appetite. I dislike eating in a zoo like atmosphere. Of the viands I tried, they were only okay. Had breakfast been more relaxed, maybe I would have enjoyed it more.

Location wise, the hotel is located  in a gentrifying area of Mandaue. There is a shopping area across the street but nothing much else. The decrepit convention center is also right across. The remainder of the area is composed of open lots.",0.5

4.0,"I have stayed at the Bai Hotel in Mandaue a few times and it is always a good experience. Some positives are that the location is in walking distance to both Parkmall & City Times Square where there are restaurants and resto bars. The rooftop bar is a great experience, especially for the view and the attentive staff. However, on occasion the band or DJ are just very loud, which takes away from a pleasant dining experience. The Pool Bar was also worth a snack and drink and only one level down from the rooftop bar. 

This past overnight stay was made very pleasant mostly due to the staff, especially Chai at the front desk, Guia & Rechelle in the lobby, assisting with check-in and check-out and other guest needs, and also Duty Mgr Johanne. 

I for sure will return to Bai again.",0.75

From the moment we pulled up at the impressive hotel we felt the warmth of the porters who greeted us with a smile and the signature hand gesture of the hotel. We passed through airport style security screening which was fast and easy and checked in to a desk of many smiling staff. The room was spacious, clean and modern and we had the best night sleep. The hotel has impressive facilities including a modern gym with good equipment, an amazing rooftop and pool, and roof deck to enjoy the late night entertainment. The buffet food was brilliant, the pool was amazing. A hotel having these facilities already makes it special however it‚Äôs the wonderful staff of Bai Hotel that.make it unforgettable.

Pros:
Room service was quick and delish 
Taxis and transport are easy to catch 

Cons:

at the entrance you are required to walk through a metal detector and have your bags scan through X-ray. 

No water fill stations so you are required to continuously use plastic water bottles 

Secondly they will allow no outside drink or food if not purchased from around the resort.

The Night Duty Manager was very condescending. After airing out the disappointment in service to which I said I was not happy at all, all he said was just ‚ÄúOk‚Äù . No service recovery whatsoever. I think his name is Nars or Nards or something

3.0,"Check-in was pretty much standard.  

Over-all, I got the impression that the hotel was not being maintained well.  The carpeting in the corridors leading to my room was musty and needed a good shampooing.  My room was spacious and the bathroom was clean. The sitting areas along the corridors were a bit dusty.  

Cafe Bai breakfast buffet offered a lot of dishes, but were quite average.  The cheese and cold cuts selection was pathetic.  I would rather have a limited yet well curated good quality dishes rather than an extensive selection of bad to average food offerings.  Because of the quality of the breakfast, I opted not to do Cafe Bai for dinner, despite of the reasonable rates.  

The hotel management/owners should seriously consider upgrading their facilities maintenance and also their anchor food outlet (I did not try their other outlets, so I do not know if they are better than Cafe Bai in terms of food quality).",0.5

4.0,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well. 

Departure was fairly smooth, though.",0.75

3.0,"This year we made two stays (07/16-07/18) and (07/31-08/04) at the Bai Hotel. We had already come four years ago and really liked this hotel.
It is ideally located. The food is delicious and the restaurants are excellent, the staff is extremely kind and ready to do anything to make you happy. But this time we were really disappointed with the condition of the rooms. They smell of humidity, black stains of humidity everywhere, not very clean, stains of dirt we even had a visit from a cockroach. The television system is also a little faulty. The other negative point is the accounting of expenses.
We had made a deposit of 6000 pesos by credit card but at the roof top they refused to put the bill on my room because I had supposedly not made a deposit. When I went to reception, they confirmed my deposit and they told me that they had to investigate, I never heard back from this investigation...
In short, it is very high time to renovate the rooms, it is good to be very strict on safety and on protective measures against covid-19, but not at the expense of the cleanliness of the rooms. Otherwise I think it will be the last time we will come to this hotel.",0.5

I wasn't even able to eat everything as much as I wanted to. My only nitpick is if they can open a little window on food that has to be made to order, as I wasn't aware of it, if it wasn't for Chef Coke who showed us the ropes!

4.0,"I've been here about 6 days. Everything is great about this hotel except for two big things. It is basically a 4-star hotel in every way imaginable but has 1-star hotel beds and 1-star hotel internet. If it weren't for the phenomenal, consistent & superb customer service rendered by Medardo on a daily basis I would have long been gone to a hotel that has better stable wifi connectivity & much better beds. The internet crashes a lot and you spend a lot of time looking at a spinning cursor which it absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that is great in every way besides what appears to resemble dial-up speeds and connectivity regardless of what the numbers say. It's very obvious the hotel is bottlenecking data to the extreme just to save money at the customer's expense with available bandwidth. The other complaint is the mattress selections. The quality in them cannot be compared because there is none. It is almost as hard as laying on the ground. I saw this complaint in a review before I booked here but gave it the benefit of the doubt. That was a mistake. The rooftop restaurant/bar is great too with beautiful scenery as well as the one on the 21st floor. Great dining areas too in their cafe on the 2nd floor. Very easy to get a taxi here as well and their shuttle is flexible for trips to places too. So Bai hotel if you are listening, fix the two things above and you'll see your reviews and reception from the public not to mention future sales peak to its highest capacity ever. Keep doing the great things you're doing like employing staff like Medardo and others that render great customer service and make it so it's easier to reach staff on your phone services too. Other runner-ups to work on is the amount of time it takes to get between floors or get an elevator at all. The internet is an absolute deal-breaker for me to ever return.",0.75

The hotel looks very nice and the room is clean, being a business hotel, don‚Äôt expect a closet.
The TV is very small, but LED .
The buffet breakfast is decent, nothing spectacular, no longanisa which should be a staple for Filipino breakfast.
I also tried the dinner breakfast. The Cebu lechon meat was a bit hard and the skin was not at all crispy.
Japanese tempura was always out of stock. They hardly replenished.  Again, the dinner buffet failed to impress me.
Smoking area, for those who smoke, was near the driveway outside a coffee shop, but the coffee shop closed very early.
Other smoking area was in a small square in the pool area.

Booked a room for 3 with breakfast and was disappointed with the buffet spread.

To be specific, their corned beef was like from the cheapest can you would find in the market. I also found it ironic thinking that we were in Cebu but they  even didn‚Äôt serve Chorizo de Cebu.

Jovelyn Zulueta has helped us a lot. She was there in almost everything, every concern we had, from  buffet to reception or anywhere we needed her. Even I lost my iphone charger from moving 1 room to another and she returned it to me safely packed and tidy. She had an absolute best performance that we could not thank her enough. We made sure we all have checked out from the hotel all good, spent more time with the local family, and flew back to Australia  safe and sound.
I just had this oppotunity to write this review and proud to mention, this good compliment is mainly for her. Again thank you heaps to Jovelyn, her help and assistance have made our stay at Dusit Thani  a better one!",0.5

Great breakfast selection but coffee was so so

Had a Very good Thai restaurant 
The beach wasn‚Äôt accessible during our stay but pool side views made up for it. 
It‚Äôs far from the main road so you need a grab or car to navigate locally.

I won‚Äôt hesitate to stay again .",0.75
5.0,"Our first visit to Dusit Thani Mactan and it was truly a pleasure.our room had a fantastic view of the water. The bath was large and modern. The bed was comfortable and the bedding first rate.

The best part of the hotel was the staff who were exceptional from the very beginning. I want to particularly call out Lei at the lobby bar, he was professional, friendly, and efficient. Leo made our experience outstanding. 

The pool is enormous and beautifully laid out. We also really enjoyed walking the grounds below the pool where they have ample seating to look out over the water, volleyball and badminton. It‚Äôs a great place for a morning or evening stroll.

We were busy most days enjoying the hotel, so ordered room service for dinner. It arrived promptly and the food was good. I appreciated that room service was available via a QR code on the menu. They also had housekeeping, amenity requests, concierge etc. available via this code. We actually used it to order a hotel car to take us back into the city when our stay was over.

First I would like to say a sincere THANK YOU to your GM Sir Laurent and to Ms Cling of Marketing for arranging this opportunity to experience your warm and gracious hospitality. We were extremely satisfied with the warm service given to us during our stay.  We loved our sea view room overlooking your huge pool and the views are so stunning both daytime and evening. We were amazed at the birthday sweets and treat that welcomed us in our room upon arrival. Special thanks to Chef for creating such delicious dessert. As a former hotelier, I must say that your hospitality and level of customer service is far exceeding my expectation of your five star resort. Your staff were so friendly and helpful when we went swimming and enjoying your Deli Cafe sweets. Breakfast experience was superb with such an extensive selection of breakfast fares. So yummy. So much we wanted to do and experience in Dusit Thani and definitely we will consider your resort as our preferred destination for us and our guests. My nephew from manila is a regular stayer in your lovely hotel. Kudos and wish you well and more awards now and in future. All the best and kind wishes to your team.

The room is huge and has everything you need, it includes both UK and US plug sockets. Modern and well kept. Complimentary water every day. 
June has been a good time to visit as it‚Äôs not very busy meaning sun beds are readily available any time of day. 

Pool is large
Cocktails are delicious 
Lovely cafe serving coffee, frappes, pastries and ice cream.
Sports bar with pool, table football etc tvs and food. Karaoke in the evenings which is a Philippino favourite. 

The staff are really lovely and welcoming with a friendly smile and are always happy to help. We want to particularly praise our new friend Leo on the main bar, who has been a delight and lovely to chat with. His cocktails were always made with care and tasted fantastic.

5.0,"We had a most wonderful stay. 6 out of 5 stars. 

One of the most perfect vacations we ever had. Thank you to Karen for the warm welcome and for going over and beyond what we expected. Our room was truly 5 star with sheets, pillows and a bed that smelled of freshly washed linens. Felt like sleeping in clouds. Our room faced the water- end to end. A view that was breathtaking as it was serene and soulful. I would go here again for this view. There was no sunset view bec it was a cloudy day. Nevertheless the view was majestic and stunning.

I don‚Äôt like swimming in public pools but Dusit‚Äôs stunning pool beckoned and I‚Äôm glad I went ahead bec the water was as it should be. I could do laps without goggles and not going half blind from chlorine. There was no chlorine smell in fact but water was clear and clean and so inviting. Don‚Äôt miss it like I almost did. 

I also don‚Äôt enjoy buffets too much but I‚Äôm glad my husband and I did the Seafood Market buffet for dinner. It must have been one of the best buffets in my life. The staff in Dusit were warm- from Karen to Leo to Kris. Not too much the chubby gay guy who dances the tinikling and pretended he didn‚Äôt know I wanted to try it out and had a dance concert to himself. A small annoyance that hasn‚Äôt marred our stay there. 

The free ride to Nustar was a superb add on. Thank you Dusit Cebu for a most magical time you gave me and my husband. We will be back with our kids. 

PS  I hope Dusit engages the community it finds itself in and that it becomes a force for social justice and progress. Specifically I hope you allow the families who fish for food in the beach area to do so without having your security guards tell them off. I hope Dusit closes the obscene gap between those who have too much and those who have way too little in your own way. Thank you.",1.0

5.0,"Dusit was an amazing stay as I went here for 2 nights alongside my partner. Firstly I'd like to shoutout Ruth, Zee and Leo for their amazing service, they were so welcoming, kind and showed fantastic customer service throughout our stay.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun. 

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience. 

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep. The bathroom and balcony areas were also really nice and clean. 

Overall Dusit deserves its 5/5 rating and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would come back to relax here in a heartbeat.",1.0

2.0,"The hotel is aesthetically pleasing. A nice decent family room for 6, a massive pool & offers aquatic zumba before sunset, a great breakfast selection & a delicious afternoon te offer. 

But these are the things we are disappointed & frustateted about: the unlimited drinks they suggested to us to pay extra to have an ¬´unlimited¬ª  access drinks ( alcoholic drinks not included) is not worth  the 1,400 per person. We were there at 11 am and the fruits shakes were not availble already. We booked days before for a 12 nn lunch at their sunset day bar restaurant but the last order for the crispy pata is already closed? Like what?  Really? Cant believe it. Just sat down and we cant order whats in the menu. This bar restaurant is  super hot, not lucky if you seated on a table without a fan above , loud , noisy , not enough ventilation. We waited long for our food. The Surf & Turf platter is not worth its price & honestly not that good. Letchon kawali pica pica is ok. 

Then we decided to use its pool, but we werent allowed to use our unlimited drinks access at the pool, they wanted us to order our drinks from the sunset bar, because the access is only at the view lounge infront of the bar because the pool is in front of the bar restautant & its not allowed. so Whats the point of paying the unlimited access then? But then foreigners were allowed.  So we ended up talking to a staff, and then finally allowed us . Why? 

Hotel staff at the view lounge & bar/restaurant werent pleasant to us generally as well. We may look not good but we are customers & we expected a just service especially in an international hotel brand. Never experienced this on other hotels yet. 

Kudos though to the Staffs at the breakfast lounge, entrance & room staffs.  They were very helpful, Nice & accomodating to our big family. Its suppose to be an international hotel brand but this branch must work on more on their (non bisaya staffs) . As for now i cant totally recommend for a big family and not be coming back for the moment. Thank you.",0.25

5.0,"Wow Dusit Thani! We have stayed and many 5-Star resorts, but rarely see one so dedicated to visitor services and enjoyment as Dusit Thani!! We used Dusit Thani as a ‚Äúhub‚Äù for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.

One bad thing we must point out. We stayed one night in a Club Room in Building 3 and the entire building and room smelled of mildew and was too hot out to open the windows. Yuck! Not sure if this is a persistent problem or not, but bad enough for us to never stay in that building again.",1.0

3.0,"Two nights into a 6 night stay. Let me begin by saying this review is from an Australian point of view which puts me in a minority in regard to guests. The hotel itself is lovely and offers a beautiful view, the staff are friendly and the pool is large. The resort is best suited to people who enjoy staying at the resort the entire time as there is nothing around the resort, no mini mart, no restaurants, no shopping‚Ä¶ Everything is a 10 minute drive away. The main things we struggled with staying at DT were:
-
No mini mart - it cost us $20 for 4 small cans of tonic water at the hotel. There is literally no where nearby to purchase water / supplies so you have to purchase at the hotel. 
-
The breakfast buffet although large caters mainly towards Asian guests.  I selected the baked beans (lukewarm) hash brown (still frozen in the middle) and a fried egg (that I had to wait 15 minutes for)
-
Drink service by the pool is slow, 2 beers will take anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes. Prices are high but then again I understand we are in a resort and prices are always going to be high. Staff are friendly but you have to get their attention otherwise you don‚Äôt get served.
-
No one informed us of what was happening around the resort- we had no idea if it was bbq night, dj night etc as there is no communication with guests.
-
Dusit Club. It served its purpose. Only downside was the cold meat and cheeses sitting directly under a light resulting in it all to sweat which wasn‚Äôt appealing and again, food was cold by the time it was served. Drinks are also very slow‚Ä¶ 
-
This is more about Cebu than the resort‚Ä¶..
Beach at Dusit Thani is pebbly so shoes are necessary.
Roosters next to resort are very noisy in the morning.
Good Restaurant/Bar options  appear limited unless you go to other resorts which you have to get a taxi too and of course pay resort prices.

Overall Dusit Thani is a lovely resort that I would recommend to traveler‚Äôs that are looking for a resort holiday destination. If you like somewhere close to everything this isn‚Äôt the place for you.

Cebu - People are very friendly but I found little else that would entice me back. Asia has a-lot of nicer places to explore.",0.5

5.0,"We recently stayed at the Dusit Thani Cebu resort for one night as part of our honeymoon celebrations.

We cannot recommend the place enough, the staff and facilities are excellent. We paid for the club lounge package which included refillable afternoon tea, 2 hours of unlimited cocktails with a selection of snacks (sushi / pigs in blankets / dumplings etc.), and breakfast.

We were served by a lovely waitress named Zee who was unbelievably friendly and attentive.

The club lounge was well worth the price we paid (1450 php) and the hotel is fantastic. Would definitely recommend this place if staying in Cebu.",1.0
3.0,"The staff as always are very good, this didn't seem like a Dusit Thani brand hotel however apart from the prices. 

The Rooms are okay with a nice sea view. 
The sunset sports bar is all wrong. There's nothing sporting about it apart from the staff wearing what looks like an unflattering newcastle football strip. 
This could be a much more romantic bar and probably should be located further down near the seaside. 
Don't bother with the regular barbecue evening down on the boardwalk. It is actually a buffet with some poor cuts of meat and few prawns and bits of fish which are actually barbecued. I expected to see rows of barbecue. The food is much fresher in the food court in mactan newtown then on this barbecue! 
The thai restaurant caters for people who don't really like thai food i think because there is very little spice. Maybe optimized for western customers. 

Breakfast is okay if you like pickled egg and dried fish and a lots of other unidentifiable korean and asian foods, but for a westerner you can just about get your hands on some toast and eggs. There is no bacon and overall not a great  breakfast unless you are as the majority here of course asian. 
Overall i don't think I will rush back to this hotel. 
On the positive side the cebu the beach is not bad.",0.5

They had some fun animation mid-afternoon with some staff leading a dance that was easy for us in the pool to follow along and enjoy.

We had lunch at BENJARONG, their signature Thai restaurant. It was one of the best Restaurant experience that we had! Their waitresses are so nice, we forget their names but the service they provide are exceptional, the food is so delicious, so glad that we have tasted authentic Thai cuisine.

The breakfast that they offer at the Tradewinds Cafe is SUPERB! They have a lot of choices in different cuisines.

Other then these particular staff, the stay was average and not as expected. The rooms were good but generally service was quite slow. 

The check in process was laborious and tiring, the last thing needed after a long flight. At meal times, you'd easily wait up to 45mins for food to be brought out in the Sports Lounge and it always seemed there was a disproportionate number of staff compared to the service being delivered. Twice we were told they were waiting for delivery of bananas / fries and I didn't have a single cold beer whilst here... It appears the Dusit Thani doesn't possess refrigerators.

Rating: 5/5

My recent stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu was an absolute delight from start to finish. The room was not only spacious and elegantly designed, but it also boasted one of the fluffiest pillows I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of resting my head on.

However, the comfort didn‚Äôt end there. The resort‚Äôs beach and long pool area provided the perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation. Whether I was soaking up the sun on the pristine beach or lounging by the expansive pool, every moment was pure bliss.

After a day of leisurely activities, returning to my room felt like coming home to a sanctuary of comfort and tranquility. The plush bedding, coupled with the heavenly pillow, ensured a restful night‚Äôs sleep like no other.

Our lunch at Sunset Sports Bar, was unforgettable! Angel, our server, She was exceptional, Kudos to Her! We savored a delightful 5 cheese pizza and spicy Korean wings with hummus, each dish bursting with flavor.

The Deluxe Sea View King Room we had was smaller than I expected, but had the same magnificent views as the lobby - a great way to wake up each morning.

Our favorite: The Dusit Club Lounge (thanks to Kevin) and the Benjarong Thai Restaurant  (thanks to Gin) - which is world class. The management was also very responsive to our requests and took very good care of us.  There are twice daily Zumba classes at the pool, theme nights in the Sunset Sports Bar and various events, so there's a bit of a party atmosphere.

4.0,"I've stayed twice, and I prefer this hotel over nearby Shangri-La.  But mechanical issues plagued both rooms, and furniture needs an update. Walls were too thin, could hear neighbor family. The breakfast buffet is huge, but can get crowded.  The Thai restaurant has a few excellent dishes (Tom kha gai, Mango sticky rice).  The Korean restaurant should be skipped entirely. Sports bar is fun and a good chill spot. The pool is beautiful and well-kept. The Club Lounge has a lovely afternoon tea set, but is otherwise a barren space that is under-utilized and unwelcoming. As noted by others, the location is remote, with bumpy and dirty access roads.  Very hard to get Grab/Taxi.",0.75

3.0,"The hotel location, amenities, staffs' services and the food are top notch like every other Dusit Thani where we had been. I am very grateful for those. 
But I have to say one flaw about this Mactan Cebu Dusit is extremely humid in the hotel room and it seems there is air-con ventilation issue. Our room floor was very wet with humidity and the bathroom became very slippery. The room got extremely moldy smell and I could not breath well in the room. Luckily I booked for one night only. 
We tried to set the ""Heat"" function on the air-con before going out for dinner then the humid and watery on the floor were gone when we were back to the room after 2 hours. But the moldy smell was still there.
If the Dusit Thani team fix this issue, this hotel is beyond perfect.

2.0,"After spending 6 nights in this resort, we left, unfortunately, not too satisfied. The hotel has a beautiful atrium, the swimming pool is immaculately maintained, and the staff is extremely friendly and always ready to help. And that is what we would praise without reservation. Breakfast is rich in choice, but it is recommended to arrive as early as possible because after 8 o'clock the breakfast room gets very crowded and there are no free tables available.
The room (deluxe sea view) was clean, but it needs a complete renovation: the furniture has been corroded by time, the bathroom also cries out for a complete renovation, and the aircon was set to the minimum when we arrived, so we felt like we were in a refrigerator. When the aircon is not working, there is a stale smell in the room, but luckily we had pleasant weather, so we could air it out on the open balcony.
Beach practically does not exist.
¬†The location of the hotel is ideal for someone who does not want to move during their stay, but otherwise be sure to be aware that walking outside the resort is not recommended.
Luckily for us, we went on trips most of the time. 
 Always use only Grab! During our stay, we exclusively used Grab, but when checking out, the staff near the reception kindly offered to order us a taxi. Big mistake, our mistake for naively accepting it. Instead of the approx. 300 php we paid for Grab from the airport to the Dusit Thani, on departure, from Dusit Thani to the airport, we paid double! For the same way! It's a shame for the hotel that they hire a taxi driver as their co-worker, who complains all the way that he has five children, how it's his birthday today and that he has no money, and at the end, when he brought us to the airport, he asks us how much we're willing to pay him!? ! We offered him 500 php just to get rid of him as soon as possible but he also demanded 100 php for taxi ordering services for Dusit Thani hotel staff. It's terrible, really terrible that the hotel management tolerates such a thing and certainly knows about it.
¬†On the resort's website, it is stated that money can be changed at the reception, but it is not stated that they only change US dollars. They not exchange euros. This can be very annoying if you don't have enough pesos for a taxi to the nearest exchange office.
¬†All in all, this is far from the luxury resort they advertise.",0.25
5.0,"We stayed for 5 nights. This was the first out of 4 hotels we stayed at whilst in the Phillipines. 
Pros
Emails before travel all answered promptly. 
All the staff (and there are lots of staff) are brilliant.
Very well looked after clean hotel.
Close to the airport and hotel arranged transfer.
Fast check in.
Location is beautiful. Sea facing room is a must.
Bed and room large. Bed was very comfortable.
The lounge is a nice touch with nibbles and cocktails and high tea included in club room prices.
Concierge will arrange trips for you. The cocktails where awesome and made correctly (the next hotel I travelled to didn't have a clue how to make cocktails), well done for awesome margarita's and Singapore slings. The red wine was nice at the club lounge. 
Everything you could possibly need in the room, including iron, ironing board, umbrella, scales, hair dryer, large fridge, extra duvet, toothbrushes, robes, slippers and toiletries etc and lots of storage space. The shower pressure is excellent.
Breakfast is excellent with lots of choice (it was the best we had while travelling in the Phillipines). Last walk in is 10.15am for breakfast, this not mentioned and witnessed one lady bring turned away, even though it wasn't 10.30.
A breakfast and coffee take out was offered when we went on an early morning trip (excellent service, other hotels did not offer this).
The pool is lovely with great views. Never had any issues with getting a sunbed.
The sports bar has free pool, darts, beer pong and fuse ball. 
The television wasn't working in our room, but we told our house keeping and this was immediately fixed by him.
The concierge, Jade, went above and beyond for us. He arranged our taxi to the port and even arranged our transfer from the port to the next hotel (we'd emailed our next hotel, but no reply).
The WiFi was good. 

Other
Nothing around hotel to walk to; but if you want to venture out a taxi can be called, experiences/trips arranged or there's a free shuttle (we didn't use the shuttle). 
The club longue ran out of both red and sparkling wine on separate occasions.
The condensation in the room makes the floors slippy. There is some advice regarding¬† keeping the balcony door closed to help with this in the room. We put towels on the floor when it was needed. 
The only improvement for a 5 star plus review would be, to be greeted with cold face towels and a complementary drink on arrival. 

Overall
If I was coming back to Cebu I would stay here again to rest after a long flight and before my onward journey, but I would need a club sea facing room again. An excellent hotel with everything you could possibly need.

I'm a member of Dujit Gold, so what is ""Welcome Amenity""? He doesn't explain it and just says he's in the room, and when I went into the room, there was nothing like that.

My luggage didn't come, and I was tired of picking things up, so I just passed it over.

I've been waiting for my luggage for over 50 minutes.
I contacted the front desk because my luggage didn't come, and they said they'd bring it to me, but it hasn't come for more than 20 minutes since then, so I went to the front desk and brought it myself.

Restaurants in the Hotel were excellent and food was really presented and tasty. Our room was really comfortable other than we only had one bedside table in a very large bedroom. The Buffet Breakfast was very good with plenty of things to choose from. The gym probably could do with some additional cardio equipment as there was only one treadmill which was out of service. The layout of the gym also perhaps could do with a rethink as it is all glass to obviously take advantage of the beautiful sea views whilst working out,  however when sun is so hot even in late evening it is like working out in a sauna. The location of the hotel meant that we had to get a taxi everywhere as there were no restaurants within walking distance. Generally speaking we had a lovely relaxing stay at the Dusit Thani.",0.75

2.0,"I was expecting so much from this hotel but left feeling like I wasted my money. The only two things I can appreciate from this place is the friendly and professional staffs and their sunset view. But that's just it! 

I'd say breakfast was not that bad, but the other meals I had from this place was so underwhelming and awful. I'd suggest you eat out and enjoy your food elsewhere. I was excited to be in Cebu for the first time and not once do they even have their famous lechon here. 

I added on a package to include high tea and evening cocktails at their club lounge and it was so depressing there.. Their ambiance was gloomy, food was horrible, drinks I'd say was ok. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. 

Phone line and TV cable at one point was not working! For a 5 star hotel, surely this is not the kind of experience they expect their guests to have. 

There's so many details this hotel is missing and I wish they improve on this. Sunbed was not comfortable, there was no comb available in the room ( you'd need to call and ask), no bath salts (even though they provide a tub), you'd need to pay extra to avail the kids playroom, and maybe I'm just nit picking here but the hotel doesn't smell nice. Haha. I've been in a lot of nice hotels before and they always have a certain luxurious scent, but not Dusit Thani... 

I want to end on a little high note.. I spent my godson's 1st birthday dinner party here and all the staff was very helpful. Without them helping set up the dinner place and being flexible with their food menu, it wouldn't be as nice.",0.25

Swimming pool is a great feature of the hotel, with the only challenge being that their are not enough sun beds for all of the guests and so we had to get up by 7am each morning to get a bed. Most of the beds are also fixed in a sitting position and very uncomfortable and without any mattresses. Didn't expect this for the standard of the hotel and the cost and  it did negatively impact our stay and many other guest complained. On a more positive note, the entertainment provided is great fun and the local dive school, Scotty's, is very highly recommended and they have a desk in reception. Highly recommend the onsite Thai restaurant after 3 visits. Also must mention the F&B team who work tirelessly at the sunset bar and are a real asset to the hotel.

I‚Äôm shocked that amenities provided needs extra payment (such as kids playground, hotels bikes..etc) Food is the weakest item, the breakfast is average but lunch buffet and New Year dinner was a disaster in my point of view! Staff always tried to be accommodating and trying their best to please.. but I think closing all restaurants in hotels to force hotel guests to pay for New Year‚Äôs eve dinner 6500pesos each(no drinks included) and provide poor quality was a rip off..

The food is Ok but not that special.
The Christmas dinner have some cold lobster served but the Quality was not the same and i think there better ways to serve this. The roasted beef loin was not refilled! Then please up serve cleanliness there was a big still alive fly inside the grape üçá 
I do understand this might be a one time incident but i have to mention it to be fair. 
The serving off Parma Ham was a positive note for me personal.

Downside: The location of the hotel is not great, one single very busy road through Lapu Lapu. 
After ordering room service the meal provided was not edible, and the room service trolley was left for over two days.
A meal ordered in the Sports bar was also not edible.
The Beach area was not great, with warning signs to be aware of Jelly Fish when swimming.

* and special mention to Zairen and Shella the lobby hostesses who are on their Job Training - they‚Äôre really an asset to the team because the warm welcome and good goodbye really matters.

We had a very good stay, the place is really beautiful and everyone everywhere in the part of the hotel are all very nice.

The only negative that i need to mention and must be look into is the Bathroom.

The shower is the worst - because it made the whole toilet wet, we tried to position for the water to go in the bathtub - but the bathtub does not drain and the water stayed :-( we had to call housekeeping staff to dry the floor and empty the tub - thank you to Christy for always helping. Plus all the shower rubber mat must be checked.

Website says it is open until 12 midnight. We came in about 10:20pm and was advised only drinks and pizza were available. We were then seated and was told only drinks were available by another waiter but they will double check about the pizza. Another waiter came in several minutes after and we were told again only drinks were available. 

I complained to the waiter that a previous staff told us he will check about the pizza and never came back even thought at first we were told we can still order. The waiter argued he just started his shift which I think was very lousy. Guests are never expected to know who‚Äôs on shift or not but they have the responsibility to ensure accurate and timely service.

Breakfast was great, and more than enough options to choose from. The room was lovely, very comfortable bed, and great views over the sea. One criticism i would say, the bathroom doesn't have a door (i was in the executive club room) felt a bit strange, bathrooms should be private, but it was ok, the shower was amazing.

5.0,"I had the opportunity to revisit Dusit Thani Mactan on October 7, 2023, just yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised by the enhancements or improvement made to the facilities.

When we entered the hotel, the usher was friendly and helpful, although I forgot to check her name tag. She guided us to the front desk with a lovely smile, so acccomodating, assisting us all our needs. All the staff members you encounter are wearing smiles and warmly greet you.

Joshua, the friendly attendant at the towel station, was just as cheerful and accommodating as we headed to the pool for the kids' swim. I also observed him participating alongside Judy Ann during the Zumba dance exercise.

Twice a day, there was a Zumba dance session led by a girl named Judy Ann, who exhibited remarkable enthusiasm even under the sun's heat. Surprisingly, I also spotted her managing the Kids play zone. She's truly a valuable asset!

The lifeguards remained highly vigilant, evident from the occasional loud whistles I heard. This underscores the establishment's commitment to prioritizing safety and security, a significant factor in their operations.

It was also delightful to see our cultural dance, the tinikling, being performed with such excellence and also the I love Cebu theme! 

At noon, we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch, and all the dishes were exceptionally tasty. Unlike my previous visit in June, they now offer ice cream for kids, which my children thoroughly enjoyed. He also loved the pumpkin soup. The food left both me and my friend completely satisfied and full.  The waiter, Norwin, served us very well too at the pool. 

After our lunch, my children chose to play in their kids' play zone and was pleasantly surprised by the significant improvements. In my previous experience, there was no one attending to the area, but now I noticed that it's always staffed. We met Denthor, who entertained us. I hope they will continue to maintain this level of supervision for the safety of the children. I'm thankful that the management took my previous comment seriously and took action. Kudos and thank you.

There were numerous activities available, and we were delighted to partake in each one. From playing Badminton to riding the kalesa, the hotel came to life with vibrant lights and music at sunset, adding to our enjoyment.

The facilities-- from the hotel room, bathroom, the restaurants, the manicured and well-maintained beachside pathways and lounge chairs with umbrellas, the big and small swimming pool -- were designed to give guests ultimate enjoyment in their vacation. The hotel staff are also very good, and they use their training to the best of their abilities to give the guests a great time at Dusit. Special mention goes to the following people who are very memorable because of the excellent guest service, their great personality and because they take time out to interact with us to make sure we were comfortable and we were enjoying ourselves -- Angelie and Min(the OJT) of the Trade Winds breakfast buffet, Teofy and Alvin of the Sunset Bar, Rome of the Benjarong Thai Restaurant and Shiela of the hotel lobby. 

I also enjoyed the aquarobics... The dance instructors are very athletic and very energized. Love them! Keep it up!

Lastly, some suggested areas for improvement: (1) when the room's shower is used, the water overflows to the entire floor space of the lavatory. Can this be resolved? We do not want slippery lavatory floors because it is a safety issue. You don't want guests to suffer an accident while at the hotel room. Putting the floor mat as a barrier is not enough because the mat gets soaked easily; (2) is the jetty always closed-off to the guests? it would be nice if it is open and can be the take-off point for boating or snorkeling..

5.0,"From the minute we arrived and right throughout our stay to the minute we left all staff and management were all so
Beautiful made our 10 Day stay out of this world 

The resort and its facilities are a 10 out 10 and the huge difference is that staff and management are so respectful to anyone that comes to their establishment

The front desk and concierge staff are always looking out for you and the most helpful people and nothing was a problem to them. 

The breakfast buffet choice was widely spread and you could not leave without feeling full with the amount of food on offer and again every day everyone was greeted beautifully by the staff

If breakfast is included in your package - highly recommend- and you are booked on a early morning trip - the staff will pack you a nice take away breakfast 

Any speciality coffee like Cappuccino - lattes etc are part of the breakfast package unlike most other resorts 

The View Bar is exactly what it is as it has a spectacular view of the ocean and serves fantastic cocktails with highly skilled staff that make you feel like you are royalty

The sunset bar is a sports bar with darts pool table and karaoke with great lunches and dinners served is set just behind the infinity pool and is filled with fun staff dressed as referees is another place to enjoy 

The NAMM Spa is by far and large the most tranquil resort style spa with great masseurs that we would highly recommend their 2.5 hr package that includes body scrub - facial and massage

The 100 metre infinity pool is Devine with the ground staff always attending to the maintenance and upkeep of this huge pool but our favourite was the Rainforest Pool that is set with more shade and Bali Huts - that is so peaceful with the sound of the waterfall 

Our Ocean Room #3511 had everything that you could ask for with the fine detail of the housekeeping efforts that everyday made the room beautiful 

On top of that our room is a club room and the benefits that you get for these rooms is astounding with daily high teas - nightly cocktails with access the Club Room Lounge was a huge surprise and most appreciated gesture

The options from dinners you have on offer you never feel you need to leave this wonderful resort 

There are snack type meals available from the Sunset - beautiful BBQ‚Äô over looking the infinity pool - weekends buffet at the Tradewinds (where breakfast is served) or dine at the Korean Restaurant or The signature Thai Restaurant 

Even though we didn‚Äôt use these facilities but this resort has an absolutely amazing Kids indoor air conditioned play centre and a well equipped gym situated in complete privacy 

The grounds and maintenance to the property are continually being looked after in a very discreet way

The resort has so much to offer and the staff and management is the place to come and stay when next in the Philippines - we will be coming back and bringing our family members with us 

You rock Dusit Thani 

Big extra thank you to Mary, Christine, Andrea, Paul, Judy, Seth, Jomar, Faith, Les, Gia, Maria, Jay, Matt, Dindo, Jan, Claude, Dalen, Noren, Jen, Ritchel and if we have missed your name thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",1.0
5.0,"Our recent stay was excellent and we will surely be coming back! All staff were very courteous--- lifeguards, gardeners, engineers, cleaners, room attendants, waiters, you name it! Room attendants Jay, Den, Maria, and Dindo left us a heart-warming note in our room after cleaning. They did a job well-done! We made sure to leave a tip.

Breakfast buffet was huge and big-time! Choices were amazing! They have improved since March 2023 --but bacons are no longer on display so just make sure to ask the staff. We were taken care of by the Tradewinds cafe staff like Mary (always brought me bacon yayyy) and Kriz (he made us refreshing watermelon juice!). We enjoyed the Saturday night seafood buffet at the Tradewinds too with my family and tried the Cabana nights next to the pool with my friends whom I have invited over (for 1500 it was reasonably priced!). Sunset Bar's bao buns were a sure winner and a must-try. The Deli's gelato was one of our faves too! 

The Rami restaurant is a great addition to your hotel should other customers try a different kind of cuisine (Korean food) and I did love the beef bulgogi I ordered. We think Rami is not under the ownership of Dusit Thani but just wanted to tell other potential customers that they should try this resto too as their food was good and their staff were also very nice--- every time we passed by they would say Hi and Hello, just like how the whole staff of Dusit Thani were. Our experience at the Benjarong restaurant was also exceptional. 

Bed was huge and comfortable. Pillows were heavenly soft. Balcony was spacious and definitely a great addition to the room we booked because we always woke up to a very relaxing sea view every morning! Only wish is I hope you retained the Damana brand for shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and cleansing gel (what we originally had in March 2023). The recent ones we had now in September 2023 changed to generic-looking toiletries. It's a 5-star hotel, we would expect the packaging could be a little more top-tier.

I also had fun with the kalesa ride last Saturday as part of the hotel's weekend activity. The horse driver/owner even offered us to drive the kalesa with his supervision. Got to talk to him a bit and glad to hear that the hotel employs him on Saturdays. We also saw him enjoy the feast during the seafood buffet. The hotel truly employs and rewards them like their own customers. I also got to witness the world clean up day on Monday and Dusit Thani gave the people who did the cleaning with free food. Truly nice of them.

Special thanks to Enan and Niki! We met them originally in March during our first stay and our 2nd stay this month in September again.Nice to see familiar faces working indeed!

We also visited 2 competitor 5-star hotels nearby during our 7-day stay in Dusit Thani and so far we loved Dusit Thani's layout of the restaurant, pool, and the huge wide-open well-ventilated reception and hotel lobby area. Everything was perfectly situated. You can order food and drinks while at the pool. Or if you're just dining at the Sunset bar you can see the the whole view of the pool and the overlooking sea from behind. Other competitor hotels' facilities were just out of place, in our own opinion.

Other thing I just want to add is most taxi drivers really want us to add a bit $ on top of the meter once they know we are headed to this hotel. Once you are at the hotel, you will understand why. It's because you are almost at the tip or the Mactan Island and the drivers could hardly catch the next passenger as they will have to go back to the main roads of Lapu-Lapu to get the next one. I know it beyond the control of the hotel already. Staff at the lobby makes sure that they disclose there is an additional 100 pesos fare on top of the meter if you ride FROM the hotel. Hotel also gives you a taxi slip before you go (you can always contact LTFRB should you have any issues with the taxi drivers). The attitude of the drivers do not in any way reflect the hotel since that is already beyond the control of Dusit Thani. Just report the incident after you have left the taxi.

*** I know stray dogs and cats are not allowed in the property but my partner and I are animal lovers and we wished to have seen the same animals we saw in March but I don't see them anymore. I hope the animals are all okay and the management does no harm to them üôè

We highly recommend Dusit Thani if you're a family, couple, or a solo traveler. Book the one with the sea view and you will NOT regret it.

With love, 
Maria and Steven ‚ù§Ô∏è",1.0

5.0,"I asked the front desk for help to eat Jollibee, which I really wanted to try in Cebu. (We couldn't use the Grab application) Ericson, a front desk clerk, made a great effort to order the menu from his personal cell phone. It was very touching to try to fulfill the request that the hotel system could not make. While trying to order, Jollibee's business hours were over, so we couldn't eat it, but later he found a Jollibee that wasn't closed personally and showed it to us. (Then we were in the pool and he came to see us himself!) But we had already placed an order at the hotel restaurant Sunset Bar. I couldn't eat Jollibee because it was the last day of our trip, but I was very touched by his passionate service. All the facilities in the hotel were excellent, the staff were friendly and the food was delicious. Thank you for making good memories in Cebu",1.0

(-) The soundproofing of the room needs improvement, we can hear the next room watching TV, moving their stuffs. The room itself is quite basic same as the bathroom for the price paid or for a Dusit Thani hotel.  A bathtub would have been nice as commented by my son.  Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.

(+) Dusit Thani hospitality still felt and happy about it. Great staff from the arrival, restaurants, housekeeping, pool, ground, they were friendly and genuine. No problem with parking.  Sunset view was superb either from the infinity pool or the bar.

5.0,"The hotel is located in a secluded area so if you want to relax, its a very nice place to Stay. There are just enough guests so its not crowded. The infinity Pool is heated! So we were still swimming at 8pm!
The room is spacious enough for 3 adults. We added an extra bed in our room for just 2,500 pesos which includes the breakfast buffet for the third person.
I must say that the breakfast selection here is excellent! (We just stayed at J-Park last weekend, and Dusit has a better selection which included native dishes and delicacies like Danggit, corned beef, puto maya, bibingka, sikwate, taho etc.. even ice cream in the breakfast
They have a Korean Japanese Section and their eggs Benedict is excellent!
They also have a lot of other activities to do like jet ski.

1.0,"I recently had the opportunity to check out this esteemed hotel last week, and I am writing to share my concerns regarding the kids' play area. Unfortunately, my experience in that area was quite disappointing due to the absence of an attendant or staff member.

As a parent, I believe it is crucial to have dedicated personnel supervising and ensuring the safety of children in play zones. However, during my stay, I noticed that the kids' play area consistently lacked any staff presence. This lack of supervision raised several concerns for me.

Firstly, without an attendant, there was a significant risk of unruly behavior among children. I witnessed instances where children were left unsupervised, which resulted in disruptive and unsafe activities. This not only compromised the experience of other children but also posed potential hazards.

Additionally, the absence of an attendant raised concerns about the overall safety of the play area. Accidents can occur unexpectedly, and it is essential to have trained individuals who can promptly respond to any mishaps or injuries. The lack of a dedicated staff member made me question the level of priority given to the well-being of children utilizing the facility.

To address this issue, and if I may recommend that this hotel will consider employing an attendant specifically for the kids' play area. This staff member could ensure the orderly conduct of children, provide guidance when necessary, and be responsible for maintaining a safe environment. 

I must note that aside from this particular concern, I did find other aspects of possible staying at this hotel satisfactory. The ambiance is so relaxing and serene as noticed. However, the absence of an attendant at the kids' play area significantly affected my overall impression of the hotel.

I genuinely hope that the management will take my feedback into consideration and make the necessary improvements to enhance the experience for future guests. Having a well-supervised and safe kids' play area is vital for families who choose your establishment.

I trust that the management will take the necessary steps to address this concern and ensure a more enjoyable experience for families visiting this hotel.",0.0

3.0,"I love beach and sea water where here in Dhusit only a portion of beach sand as everything else rocky area.
Since am not really fun of that as i got plenty near my home i prefer beach sand where i do like longer barefoot walk.
Also to note during my visit at the little portion where you can supposedly swim i was dissapointed too as loads of garbage floating around where management could have put 2 meters net under the float they put around their area. So basically no chance of swimming again on the beach side.
So went to pool instead but to note its only 4 meters deep only good for shorter in height and kids.
So to that will be your swim around the hotel.
Anyway Spa massage therapist are good!
Hopitality of staff is very good too!
Only complain was in 3days time no television working at all and blaiming provider.
The heck was that its room rate inclusive. Only compensation is a movie costing 500 pesos only..
This hotel is not cheap and price compared to other hotels nearby are better with White sand and sunrise.
Restaurant food buffet are a lot of food but wandering where those food go when only guest seen eating does not even fill half of its capacity.
The Thai Restaurant food was really good and that is where we could come back for!
To make you guys aware too this hotel is on the west side of Punta Engano Mactan where no cover after 12 noon and youll get the maximum heat of the SUN. Must bring 100% sunscreen and lots of water to drink to avoid dehydration.
So were on our next hotel and keep watching my next hotel 2023 reviews! 
At the end i still prefer other hotel same in price comparison and youll be spoilt and a rooms are nicer too! 

Enjoy your time whereever you wanna be!
Have a nice day!",0.5

3.0,"While most reviews are very good for this hotel I feel most are coming from locals that perhaps have not really experienced 5 star hotels in other countries. For a local this may be a great hotel but for me an International traveller it does not get past 3.5-4 stars at best.

Checkin was fine the hotel has a nice lobby and reception area. The room is quite small but at least clean.

This hotel is quite remote there is nothing but slums surrounding the hotel so there is really nowhere to go unless you drive. The hotel has a nice pool area however, it's packed with people and you feel like all eyes are on you when you're poolside. There are quite a few locals here with a day pass so the pool area is not exclusive to hotel guests. I ordered a pina colada at the poolside restaurant and was given a yellow drink. Aparently they had no coconut cream but if you dont have the key ingredient then don't serve it! They tried to correct the drink but to no avail.

Weeds are visible in green areas around the pool not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. 

ANNOYING: You must pay everytime you eat or drink anything at all restaurants and bars becuase as the staff say we are renting this from the hotel so we need to charge you and you cannot add it to your room.
When I am on vacation i DO NOT WANT TO PAY everytime I eat or drink something this is truly unacceptable.

BAD: If you need wifi don't come to this hotel! I complained that it is very slow and keeps breaking up. A technician came to my room who tried his best but could not resolve the wifi issue.

The wifi is unstable and slow I could not do business here.

POOR: There is no International style buffet reastaurant. At least not during the week. Staff told me it's only open on Sat/Sun lunchtime. There is a thai, and korean restaurant but if you don't like that style of food you have very little choice.

I asked housekeeping for camomile tea and was given green tea.
I could hear bing bing bing.... non stop coming from housekeeping's phone to the point where I had to ask her to place her phone on silent.

The breakfast was good and service was fine.

All round unless you want to spend the whole day in the busy pool area you will be bored here. I felt it is overpriced and more expensive than the Sofitel in Manila while nowhere nearly as good. I would not consider coming back here again.

5.0,"This was my first visit to Dusit and I had a wonderful experience. I wanted some alone time so I arrived on a weekday and stayed for 3 days. Being able to speak the vernacular, I could converse with the staff well and they readily indulged my requests. 

The food at Sunset Bar was relatively good, I highly recommend the the Angus Steak. Coffee preparation and presentation need to be improved (espresso-based preferred), and more a la carte dishes should be offered especially for solo travelers. I felt that Sunset Bar needed more variety especially if one plans to stay in the hotel for several days. 

Room Service was slow but the staff was very helpful. One thing I'd like to commend is that I genuinely felt the sincerity when the staff smiled and greeted me every morning. They were very hospitable and accommodating. I'd like to commend Norwin, Leo, and Janvie. I was mostly interacting with them during my stay, and they really excelled in customer service. 

Things to note: If you're looking at getting a tan, the pool is best from 8am-12nn. The beach is best reserved for reading and maybe some snorkeling (depending on the tide, weather, and the urchins). The beach unfortunately does not have fine sand, has a stony/rough sea bed with limited swimmable areas. SUP is offered as well for only P500++. ",1.0

The reception personnel John was kind enough to let us check in early. They understood that kids that came from a plane ride needs to rest. He put all our rooms close to each other.

The Seaview room was spectacular. It has a balcony that overlooks the ocean and the pool or the ocean and the outdoor activity area. The balcony is big enough for you to enjoy tea time or dinner looking out the view.

The hotel has an indoor play area for children to enjoy and play with each other and a relaxing spa for the adults to unwind.

The infinity pool overlooks the awesome shipwreck anchored at the beach.
The pool is not very deep but deep enough  for you to ve submerged even if you are standing, and a there is also a bar beside the pool for you to enjoy some drinks while you swim. There is a separate kiddie pool that can accommodate toddlers.

They do have a spacious gym with a view of the ocean and a yoga class outdoor overlooking the beach.

The circular hotel bar at the lobby offers a great view of the stars and ocean.

They offer various restaurants to cater to different tastes; a korean resto, a thai resto and a sports bar near the pool where you can play billiards and watch sports tv.

Most of the patrons are couples but there are a few families as well.

Since Mactan is far from the city, they offer a complimentary shuttle to take the guests to the different malls in the city.",1.0

5.0,"There are four restaurants available in this 5-star hotel which serves filipino, thai and korean food. One of them is trendwinds cafe (buffet) which has a good seaview. We also tried sunset bar which is nearby the infinity pool (serves ala carte menu and has a billiard table where you can play) and the other one is the Rami restaurant which is new to the hotel so they don't offer charge to room option. All of these restaurants serves good food. For the room, it has shower, hair dryer and built-in-cabinet with ironing board and iron. The gym also has a great sea view, so you can exercise while enjoying the sea view.

Besides the infinity pool, they also have the rainforest pool which is much smaller and perfect for kids. Expect a crowd on their infinity pool as it has the best view which is loved by the guests.

Water activities are also available, such as parasailing, jetski (1 hour use) and snorkeling.

The hotel is 45 minutes away from the airport, traffic included. There are times wherein I'm having a hard time connecting to the internet via mobile data as I had to attend a zoom meeting. Unfortunately, I cannot connect using their wifi for my zoom meeting, seems that it's blocked but I can browse the internet with their wifi. I love that I only have to connect once using the username provided and my device is connected to wifi wherever I am in the hotel unlike in other hotels, if you leave the room, you'll have to connect to their public wifi.

Please continue to treat our fellow Cebuanoes with the same level of respect and hospitality that foreigners are shown.
I can say I will definitely come back again and hope to receive the same experience.

1.0,"We had a decent stay until the last night. Lydia from the breakfast staff was incredibly rude and lack any sort of customer service skills. When we started eating, she insisted that the breakfast was not included and we had to pay 2300PH in the worst possible tone. After finishing, she ran across the lobby to give us the bill and ensured we paid. When we took it up with front desk, breakfast was in fact included (add-on upon check in) and she obviously came running to us to ensure that she was not at fault for this error. Not to mention, there was no apology from her or her team, did not serve us at all during the meal and they waited in the front of the lobby to ensure she can get her words in. Why let us into the restaurant saying that the meal was included, only to retract that statement before our meal?

I think this needs to be brought up as for a 5 star hotel, staff make up the experience. Better scanning for candidates in the hospitality industry should be a priority.",0.0

There were stations for bread, eggs, noodles, cheese and cold cuts, local desserts, and fresh fruit juices. You can try local Filipino, Korean, Indian, Italian, and Japanese dishes. It was also a unique sight to see staff walking around carrying local taho container over his shoulders and calling out 'Taho!' so guests can try it.

3.0,"We've been there yesterday with my family (spouse and kid) and with a friend and her kid for Easter Egg Day Hunt. We we're looking for some decent property, not crowded that can accomodate our kids Easter Day experience. We are frequent travellers (local and abroad) and been here the 1st time. So we checked it out if it's worth a try. Me and my friend paid registration online and communicated via email and phone.

Pros:
1. Excellent property and breath taking view of the Mactan Channel.
2. Food is good.
3. Ample parking space.
4. F&B staff are good. Kudos Carlo from F&B
5. Security guys are nice.
6. Restrooms are within proximity 

Needs Improvement. 1 out of 5.
1. Lifeguards approached us more than 4 times different times, same issue
- We were initially told that pool towel is not applicable for Day Use (okay. Properties like Jpark, Plantation Bay, Bluewater, Crimson, Shang are not like this. So we thought your property, your rules.) 
- We will pay for extra adult that will swim to guard our kids while swimming but due to excess people in the Kid Zone they cant accomodate me and advised to go back later for payment. (We already made prepayment for our kids but never anticipated to pay for 1 adult, hence paying at the hotel) 
- I was asked for a receipt for the adult to swim. But hey, I was asked this question minutes I came from Kids Zone. I also approached front office to pay but referred me to another person.
 - We were told that pool use is included in the Easter Day Egg Hunt. 
- I asked the lady from Kid Zone reported this 2nd time and was told that lifeguards are monitoring guests for possible lost pool towels. (But hey! Why are we being singled out and being monitored?  For someone who is trying to enjoy the view, the experience. Your lifeguards assumed we are going to take your pool towels? Lol 
- Food menu QR 
- Our kids had fun with Easter Egg Day Hunt experience but needs improvement with execution
- After event, I approached the front office to pay for 1 adult for pool only use. Luckily I saw April from Kid Zone and paid the fee. (So why front office has to bounce me to another person if you can process my payment?) I've been passed around 3 times and your lack of coordination played a big role to our experience. 
- Some staff has this discrimination for local guests despite that we can afford all fees you impose us. Mind you, we are picky to resorts when we thought Dusit is one of them.

We might go back for check in and see the experience if it improves. I hope some of your staff will stop this discrimination to Filipino local guests.

1.0,"Stayed for several nights in a club room.  Hotel itself is nice but very spread out.
I booked a club lounge room and emailed to let them know myself & daughter are coeliac and they confirmed back saying they could accomodate us with gluten free food. 
Unfortunately they didn‚Äôt rely this message to the club lounge so our first day all they could offer us was a salad- not good enough when I‚Äôm paying top dollar for a room.
The worst was when we left- they ordered a taxi for us to the airport- they told us it was metered.
I paid my outstanding bill (recipes kept).  It is a 30 min drive to the airport.  15 mins into the drive the taxi driver got a ph call.  He pulled off to the side of the road and started yelling at us that he had to turn around and we had to pay 400 pesos to the hotel.  The hotel were on speaker and were also yelling at us. I asked the driver to please drive as I have paid my bill and we would miss our flight.  After much yelling we started again only to have the hotel continually state we owed them money.  When we arrived to the airport the driver asked for more than double what the hotel said it would be.  I asked where the meter was- he said it was broken.  I said that‚Äôs not good enough the hotel said it was metered.  
He ended up slamming the boot door on my daughters arm- myself and my daughter were in tears at the airport.  This is simply not good enough from any hotel.
I will be taking this matter up with head office when I return home. ",0.0

5.0,"I took my mom and dad to Dusit Thani Mactan last November. It was a bit hard to contact the hotel from the United States, but thankfully, Marejun got in touch with me through Whatsapp and did everything possible to assist me, from upgrading my room, and for the dining vouchers. It was very impressive. When we arrived at the resort, we were given a very warm welcome by the hotel staff. The check-in process was smooth, the bellman assisted us with our bags, and the young ladies brought us some goodies along with a handwritten letter from the General Manager. The room was spacious and was very clean. The toilet have complete amenities with a nice bathtub. It has a big balcony facing the bay and overlooking the City of Cebu. The whole resort was not crowded, so it's very ideal for those who want to have a tranquil vacation. We had our dinner on the first night at Benjarong. Kudos to our waiter Javier for a very personalized touch and for continuously checking on us. He and his team even sang a birthday song to my parents which I really appreciate. The Thai food choices were great! The next early morning, the hotel's ambience was very refreshing. The pool water was warm, and seriously, this was the best infinity pool I've ever seen, complete with loungers and cabanas with no extra cost. Overall, I rate our stay there as excellent, and I'd love to come back again. Hopefully, they would open the beach access very soon. Thanks to all the staff and the General Manager who made our short stay a very memorable one.",1.0

4.0,"We were here for a night to celebrate the new year. The pictures shoes the beautiful pool but there was a storm here some time back and with that a big container ship is stranded here and that was kind of cool to look at with a great story about the ship from the staff. The hotel staff was very accommodating and their bartender was top notch. The room was great and went well over our ecxpectations. However there was one thing I got disappointed by since this is a five star hotel and that was that they didn't bother cleaning the ice tray in our room but they did change it the moment I asked for it but still. That is when I noticed that this was a trend that kept coming. later they weren't quite ready with the evening activity that people had payed for. They set up the place wile we were all getting our welcome drinks and they weren't ready before maybe 30 min before midnight, they had done everything half way and uncoordinated. They had a fire show at the end but that was small and seemed unplanned since it looked like someone just practicing more then giving a show. She had a great technique its just not a performance yet but I think if she had time to plan then she could be great.
I hope they can fix this for next time since their venue deserved better as we visited a few hotels on this trip and this was the most luxurious venue we could see in Cebu. 

We would recommend this hotel if you are looking for a luxurious stay in Cebu. The roms is great and the staff always comes with a smile.",0.75

2.0,"Shout Outs:
The staff are kind, warm, and hardworking Seth (Deli) , Lovely (Deli), Ditchie (Sunset Bar), and Maria (Room Attendant) were beyond exceptional. If only the faciities, food, and front desk were as exceptional than this truly would be a 5 star hotel. 

Our Journey:

We choose Dusit Thani Cebu because we have stayed at numerous other properties throughout the world and have alywas found the service and accomdations truly superb.  Unforutnately I am not certian how this property is associated with the Dusit Thani Brand.  
  
Our group had  a total of three rooms booked which were all the Deluxe Rooms (the lowest category room).  Upon check in we were shocked at how small the rooms were (granted the size of the room is listed in the booking I did not pay attention assuming a 5 star hotel would only have reasonable sized rooms).   Beyond being smaller than expected all three of the rooms had significant problems (1) one of the rooms tv controller did not work and the television kept flickering (2) one of the rooms in the bathroom floor had no lip (which was not the case in 2 of the other rooms) which resulted in flooding when showering, (3) one of the rooms had several ants and (4) all of the air conditioning was very very weak (even after calling and having them serviced.  All these things were so bad I went down to the front desk to ask if we could cancel and move to a different hotel. Unfortunately, they said one of our bookings were prepaid and they could not give us a refund, but I could call Chase Ultimate rewards and ask for a refund of any non used days. I called immediatley and was told that Chase would need to ask the hotel and to call back later. Well the that next morning we had a tour booked to go to Olsob for Whale Shark Excursion (awesome you should do it) and when we came back  I went to talk to the front desk they upgraded us to club rooms, which was nice in size and the air conditioning worked!  Unfortunately on Tuesday and Wednesday the internet went from 150mbs down to 3 to 8mbs, which prevented me from being able to access my VPN for work (which was one of the reason I booked here for WIFI) it was like this durring the workday 9:00am-4:00pm.  i noticed durring my stay when the hotel is hosting a conference the internet becomes almost non usable for streaming videos or accessing  a VPN to conduct work is not possible. 

The rooms showers are also rather disgusting and I think re-caulking or deep cleaning the grout should be performed.  There is a serious lack of proper drainage which causes  part of the shower to become extremely slippery.

I've since booked another hotel even through I have a booking for 3 more nights (don't know if I will get refunded), because I can not stand the lack of true 5 star ammenities I've come to expect when staying at Dusit Thani properties.  I am hopeful the hotel will refund me the unused portion of my reservation and implment some improvements outlined below so they truly can become a 5 star facility. 

Recommendations to Management: 

*Have staff welcome guests upon check in and introduce themselves.  Have your front desk give an overview of the resturants and facilities. Also it would be nice for the staff to explain the big ugly boat ruining the view that guests paid top dollar to see and explain that even though one of the buildings is being worked on construction and noise will not be heard during the night. 

*Please ensure air conditioning in building 2 is working just as good as building 3, The difference is rather drastic. 

* I was asked 5 times in my stay to do a review on trip advisor even though on 3 of the conversations I said my stay was below expecations (maybe it was a language barrier), but I would train staff to apologize instead of asking for a review on trip adivsor. 

*In the breakfast buffet have staff fill coffee at the tables more frequently or make recommendations on some of the highlights of the buffet that day.  Also make sure the breakfast buffet serving utensils are placed properly. Two times  at 6:20am dishes were missing serving utensils. 

*Sunset bar service is slow. I am not sure if it is the kitchen or what, but the food time seems excessive.  Figure out a better way to stream line the process to increase the speed. 

*Research ways to prioritize or create seperate WIFI signals for guests and conference attendees so that service for hotel guests work the entire time.

*Better promotion of the special dinning events occuring at resturants. We were notified of the event last minute and could not attend.  The hotel should have access to booking emails and should send out any weekly events that coud be of interest. 

*Fix the lack of lippage in some of the rooms showers to ensure they do not continue to flood the entire bathroom floor.

1.0,"We arrived to our room and found it to be a room with a connecting door. This meant the family next door (despite not being very loud) could be heard clearly in our room. Outside the view was the car park and a scaffolding. We called reception and explained the situation and to be fair they moved us to a room without a connecting door.

The restaurant - We arrived back from a lovely trip and fancied some 5 star cuisine. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes (not too long so no problem) and nobody had come over. We went to retrieve the menu and poured our own water whilst we waited. After another 10 minutes, still no one had served us (again not a problem) so we went up to the bar and ordered. My main meal (a burger) came and I started eating and we thought the other meal would be a arriving soon, my partners (chicken adobo) did not arrive. Sometimes there is a delay so no problem. 35 minutes later her food had still not arrived. At this point no one had addressed us or mentioned the delay. We explained this to the staff and the waitress said ‚Äúthe kitchen was busy‚Äù which again, we understand. We just explained that it is nice to eat together and that for the price that is what we would also expect. We said to them don‚Äôt worry about the 2nd meal to which the manager then became involved and said they‚Äôd take the 2nd meal off the bill. Fair enough. The bill comes and there is a service charge? What service? I said there is a service charge here but we‚Äôve not really had too much service, to which he said it‚Äôs included in the bill. Okay, no problem - paid it. 

Ironically, at most opportunities the waiters ask you to leave a trip advisor review explaining that you‚Äôve had good service and they give you their name. A little scan me code appears on your table and then away you go writing your positive review. 

The gym - went to the gym to work off them meals that were not coming from the kitchen. Inside there was a party of about 12 people also using the gym. There was no one manning the desk and inside was an absolute circus. They were playing football with the yoga balls and had kids running around picking up the different gym equipment and in general, screaming. 

The water - each day you are stocked with two waters. They are shot size versions of waters. Fair enough they say if you need restocking that they will do this. We asked reception for more water (did not come) then asked room service via telephone for 4 waters to see us through the day. They knocked and brought two. If you want to clench your thirst, you will have job. 

Room service - We ordered sweet potato fries and chicken cesar wraps (total cost with service) 20 pounds. Nothing too unreasonable. However, the food was appalling. Would say it‚Äôs the worst room service I‚Äôve ever had. 

All in all it is 2 or 3 star place dressed up as 5 star via the reviews they encourage you to make on the actual times when they should be bringing you your dinner. More time bringing dinner, less time asking for reviews.

We will get a response to this by someone who will say something along the lines of thanks for your feedback and we will look into this and try to improve. Well, you obviously don‚Äôt.

Additionally, because the hotel is so bad and they know it. They try to wash out all the negative reviews by getting the waiters to consistently ask for positive reviews and get you to name drop them. Which is why you‚Äôll see most reviews saying I was served by ‚ÄúX‚Äù who gave me great service. 

650 pounds for 4 nights = food that never comes, busy kitchens, car park view, a rave in the gym and miniature bottles of water that wouldn‚Äôt keep an ant hydrated.",0.0

Ma'am Grace from Dusit Club was also very accommodating and made our celebration very special. Food at Benjarong restaurant was very excellent, kudos to the chef and staff there.

1.0,"The only thing Dusit Thani is good at is saying thank you sir and appearing like servants.  Our room had multiple leaks from multiple spots, light fixtures hanging and broken and the shower also didn‚Äôt work properly.  The breakfast was incredibly expensive for the area and offered less than a Jollibee especially if you went down anytime after 8:30 in the morning.  Majority of the options were just not offered a second time if they had been finished so the few good items are only consumable if you wake up at 6AM on your vacation.  The pools are overcrowded and unheated.  The hotel is also located way too far to go anywhere so that you are charged extra pesos to get a taxi.  Some of the rooms and buildings are undergoing construction with no change in rates and the rooms are anything but soundproof.  We could hear our upstairs and downstairs neighbors regularly.  I had stayed at 5 other hotels during my time here and this one is far and away the worst.  Staff assisted with my bags on one occasion and we had to walk from the end of the building 3 parking lot with our entire luggage case and had to drag it through the sewage waste located at that lot.

1.0,"Please do not stay at this hotel.  Below is a list of all things we encountered in the first 12 hours of our stay:

1.  Don‚Äôt let the lobby or infinity pool fool you.  While these are very nice and well designed for the perfect Instagram or marketing photo, the rest of the hotel lacks any upgrades or detail

2. The Dusit does not believe in AC or even fans for any common areas or the sports bar making it very muggy

3. During our stay, the hotel was clearly understaffed catering to the Hyundai convention.  As a matter of business, they should be taken care of the best, however poor planning doesn‚Äôt mean the remains guests service should be sub par including bathrooms that had standing fluids on the floor for elongated periods of time 

4. Our check in was prompt, however there was only one attendant at the desk.  We booked through Expedia which may be why our deluxe room has windows that haven‚Äôt been cleaned in years and faces the garbage bins / parking lot 

5. Continuing with the rooms, the last renovation must have been completed  in the 90‚Äôs.  The cabinets and drawers are of poor quality / very old

6. Our shower (likely the most disturbing) hasn‚Äôt had a thorough cleaning in years.  The grout is severely discolored and something may be growing there. 

7. The beds have a thin mattress pad, however it can‚Äôt hid the uncomfortably hard mattress underneath 

8. The restaurants / dining experience had many flaws.  Again, likely due to the convention, many items had run out from mineral water to various food selections.  This again is simply poor planning where a chicken wrap should not take an hour with only 6-10 tables being utilized.  

10. Lastly, when we arrived, the pool was closed for water treatment.  Many of the marketing photos were of this pool that couldn‚Äôt be used as there doesn‚Äôt appear to be any beach access

I will point out that the wifi and breakfast were very good, however there were many smaller things, and likely more to come, not listed.  We came to Cebu expecting to have some Filipino culture but quickly came to realize this hotel is neither comfortable nor enjoyable.  Don‚Äôt book if it‚Äôs more than $50 usd a night.",0.0

The rooms are to small and although clean, are rundown and could do with a makeover.  We had to ask for an additional bed as the supposedly queen size beds had been more like a single European sized bed and  hence, we had quite a ‚Äûcamping feel‚Äú  during nights.

Views of other large island resorts etc. The room was freezing cold, even after asking 4 times Club staff to have it looked at - Nothing happened, unfortunately. The local Taxi scam was an issue arranged/encouraged by the Hotel was a little upsetting. Reported to Concierge staff who arranged the Taxi and was told THEY WOULD HANDLE IT? No response from staff to us. Location is an issue if you wish to commute to Cebu City. Maybe they need a shuttle service? Maybe it was the time of year, but the excessive VAT/SERVICE CHARGE and two local taxes seemed a little excessive, given the actual price of the rooms during this period. The pool area is extremely slippery, as I experienced. The pool is large and clean. The Dusit Club is an Oasis and we used it a lot. Overall we enjoyed the stay, but the COLD COLD ROOM AND TAXI issue needed to be addressed before we left and this really impacted our experience (HONEYMOON) greatly.",0.5

Altogether, we had a lot of food and drinks in a very relaxing environment. The rooms had everything and I did not miss not having a balcony! The staff were very attentive.

Definitely not coming back and would not recommend it. ",0.0
3.0,"The hotel is beautiful but the service is not up to 5-star standards. It appears the front desk and cleaning departments are woefully understaffed despite many other staff milling around the front lobby area.
We tried to check-in at 2:30pm after standing in a long slow-moving line. We were told the room was not ready which was not a big deal since standard check in is 3pm. I specifically asked what time the room would be available and was told they were trying for before 3pm. Unlike at a true 5-star, they made no offer to contact me when the room was available so we just sat in the lobby. At 3:15 I got back in the long line at the front desk and finally reached it at 4pm. The story was now that the room would not be available until 5:30pm. If they told me 5:30 originally, we would have changed into our swimsuits and enjoyed the pool. I was offered a downgrade to a smaller size bed without a sea view which was declined. We accepted the offer to wait in the lounge with free snacks and drinks . Around 5pm a staff member sought us out in the lounge to notify us that our room was available and we needed to go to front desk for our keys.  If they are going to take the time to find us, why not bring us the keys as expected for a 5-star? We had already waited for over an hour at the front desk and the lines were still long and slow-moving so we went for an early dinner. 
Benjarong Restaurant is highly recommended, they were fully booked but accommodated us due to the issues we were experiencing trying to get our room. 
We were finally able to get our keys after dinner and the room is large and comfortable and exactly as promised on the website. Hopefully the rest of our stay will be smoother than the check-in process was.",0.5

Breakfast was an extensive buffet which ticked the boxes. At other times the food offering was a bit limited, but adequate. There was a Thai restaurant but it seemed to be permanently deserted.
Nice outside pool. Decent gym.
Staff were all excellent. Professional and friendly.
We enjoyed our stay and would go back. But, the downside to the hotel is that it is at the end of a bumpy road at the end of Mactan Island. Middle of nowhere! Ok if you stay on site but tedious if you want to go out.",0.75

+ Very good breakfast with a lot of various options 

- Extremely slow on check ins and outs. 
- We arrived at 17:30 - two and a half hours - after check it time - and still had to wait more than an hour for our room to be ready
- Very loud rooms - you can hear your neighbor breathing 
- Only one power plug next to beds in a twin bed room 
- The lower part of the door to the bathroom/toilet is for some reason designed like an open window shades so you can hear everything ""happening"" there.

- Bathroom gets flooded after shower
- Extremely cold, not heated pool
- Very bad service at the pool: waiter comes by every 40 min, (forgot straws for cocktails and didn't bring them even after reminding)
Very small sand beach which has no meaning when low tide.

The room was nice and overlooked the ocean.  The resort is still in the process of recovering from Typhoon Odette, so there was construction going on which meant some noise and some closed off areas.  This caused the only issue we had --a door that was being used by the construction workers would slam extremely hard every time they used it, shaking the wall in our room.  I spoke to the front desk and they did try to remedy the issue.   Overall the stay was very nice. The staff was outstanding.

3.0,"Dusit Thani Mactan is a five-star hotel. As a hotelier myself, I expected five-star end-to-end guest service experience.

Unfortunately, Dust Thani Mactan fell below expectations. The food and ambience- great. We loved our Christmas Eve Dinner at Benjarong.

Most of the staff was great, except for the Chef in-charge at the omelette section of the breakfast buffet at the Tradewinds outlet, who argued with his assistant in front of me while I was waiting for my egg omelette.

What was off-putting and very disappointing was when we requested to have our dinner and breakfast billed to our room. For both instances, the staff told us ""we will check if that's possible"" only to tell us a few minutes later that they cannot do it! So we have to return to our room to get our credit card.

What an inconvenience! The lady at the Breakfast Buffet lobby didn't even look sympathetic at all-what we got is the ""it's your problem, not mine"" vibes. I don't understand why a five-star hotel cannot bill-to-room meals by checked-in guests.
Why are they making this inconvenient for us, I cannot fathom!

Isn't it the point of a Five-star rating to have a cut-above-the-rest guest service experience? Is this the Dust Thani Guest Service standard: to refuse a checked-in guest's bill-to-room request and actually choose for the guest to walk back to a separate building to get the credit card? 

I mean we are in a resort, and as guests we don't think it's practical to bring our credit cards and wallets all the time, right?

If Shangri-la Mactan can do it for us, why can't Dusit Thani Mactan? Both are five-star hotels. I worked at a five-star hotel abroad and I cannot understand, both professionally and personally why Dusit Thani Mactan would allow such inconvenience to their hotel guests.",0.5

5.0,"The Dusit Thani resort in Mactan has far exceeded the standards of most other resorts, and I should know. 
I am a former employee of the Hilton Corporation and have had held many hospitality positions in my career. In this field I have visited resorts in the US, Thailand, and the Philippines. The Dusit Thani wins. Here is why:
The guest experience is finely curated from the first step onto the immaculate grounds, to the pools, and even the restroom facilities, which are difficult to maintain. The restaurants are staffed by crews of well trained and resourceful staff members who truly take pride in their jobs, you can actually see their smiles even beneath their masks! 
I write this review today after several particular examples of phenomenal customer service by these staff members. First, my ATM card was declined at the ATM on site which caused me some distress. I needed to go to town and the taxis only take cash. One employee Nikki, recognized my dilemma and gave me taxi fare from his own pocket with nothing but trust that I would pay him back. 
Second, I went to dinner at the amazing Thai restaurant. I was greeted with a friendly smile and placed at a beautiful  table with a complimentary anti oxidant drink, and a cold hand towel. 
After perusing the menu, I didn‚Äôt find my favorite Thai dish, beef pad kra pow, and ordered some other items. My server Mardie immediately went to the Chef and asked if they would make my favorite dish, which he happily agreed. It was delicious!
During my meal, Clint, Mardie, Trisha, Jeffery and Kirby made me feel like a very special guest, and if I had a resort, I would try to steal all of them away. Lastly, even though management works mostly behind the scenes, it is obvious they are working hard to ensure thar the guest experience lives up to Dusit Thani standards. 
Well done everyone!",1.0
2.0,"First experience was a dirty public restroom. Upon check-in we were told that the seaview room is already full since we arrived at 6pm. When we got to the room, there was no coffee packs. Only sugar and creamer.  Bed blanket was upside down. Breakfast buffet option was limited and was not refilled fast enough. when we returned to our room in for an afternoon break, there was only one towel for a family registered room. We found what we think is a covid test kit in the fridge. Again, the coffee pack was not refilled. Upon checkout, I inquired about the promo discount on my credit card. I was informed the rates on my nilling was already doscounted. I asked for the original computation without the discount, only then was I given a new receipt with the same billing but now with the right discount. While the facilities were great, service was very poor. ",0.25

They took care of us from the moment we arrived, it made our experience extremely pleasurable not having to worry about what to do during the stay. We came to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs birthday and the resort just made it so memorable for my daughter and the whole family. The check in and check out has been done very smoothly with very friendly staff and allow flexibility of late check out. We were recommended the best suite from the beginning which can accommodate the whole member of the family, it was large, spacious, wide balcony facing the ocean.Thanks to our housekeeping who takes care of full cleanliness and the special towel arts and fresh flowers. The signature purple sweets/ cakes arranged as welcome compliments so creamy and tasty. We are all so in love with it. We also had the club lounge access which we don‚Äôt need to worry our snacks throughout the day. The restaurant that serves breakfast offers delicious international and native cuisines and all restaurant staff were very friendly and attentive, in addition they surprised my baby girl a lively birthday song during our meal. You have to visit their Thai ‚ÄúBenjarong‚Äù restaurant as well, as it has the most authentic and best Thai flavors you‚Äôll surely love, thanks to Jeffrey, he‚Äôs very professional and knows what‚Äôs best for our appetite and love to mention, they greeted and sang a happy birthday to little girl during our dinner ( something that we haven‚Äôt expect!) . They have beach chairs out in front of the hotel and super wide infinity pool which is the best part of the resort. You‚Äôll enjoy the sun until late and can take a lot of beautiful pictures in any angle.

3.0,"Overall I found the Dusit Thani Mactan to be more like a 4-star property. It is very average and not at all value for money I paid for the room.
- The architectural design isn't user friendly. Layout of bathrooms isn't functional. You end up wetting the whole bathroom while showering.
- Rooms are small for 32sqm. Lot of space is wasted in the entrance vestibule and area probably includes the balcony. The rooms are very small.
- Swimming pools weren't clean. There were some dirt and particles floating in.
- The 'beach' is not a beach as such. Completely rocky. Huge challenge if you go swimming / snorkeling. 
- The view from Sea View Rooms is not bad, though beyond the sea, you see the island of Cebu so the view isn't infinite.
- The food was just average. Service was slow.
- Staff, just like everywhere in the Philippines, were very polite but not trained very well. A lot of construction persons were using the guest lifts very often. That brings to the fact that many parts of the hotel are under construction.
- The Thai restaurant - Benjarong - was awesome, including taste, awesome presentation and super staff!
- Location is far from anything around. Nearest place where you can get some groceries / convenience store is Newtown, around 10min drive.
OVERALL - I wouldn't mind staying here if it was under USD 120 per night but for the current rates, I am not returning. Sorry guys.",0.5

There is also construction going on at the resort which was not stated on the website or the 3rd party site I booked from. There should be a clear message for all potential customers that this is the case before we book.

Paul, Adrianna and Manolitte who made the perfect mojito for the wife (less sugary) at The View Lobby all were accommodating and engaging. We shared a good laugh!  The infinity pool is one of the best we have seen,  well maintained and clean. Everyone has amazing smile to share. Although the location is out of the way, it will only take you 12-15 mins drive to Mactan Newtown.

The OK stuff: My wife has difficulty making a reservation to drive direct business in the hope they would do price match from a 3rd party booking site,  sadly every attempt was denied and so we ended up booking via Agoda. The Breakfast team was very attentive on our 1st & 2nd day, not unitl my wife had breakfast on her own and pretty much was ignored. No one came to ask ""can i get you some coffee"" or ""would you like some water"". I believe this needs to be address and educate staff further to deliver equal customer service, regardless of the stature. Please also look into the bar fridge's temperature.

Dusit Thani, which translates to ‚ÄúTown in Heaven‚Äù,  is a Thai owned resort, integrating Thai culture with the local Cebuana culture & people that makes for a beautiful blend for excellent hospitality that is focused to please resort guests from all over the world.

For my experience, All the resort‚Äôs personnel, from the concierge, front desk, housekeeping & room service, etc., Just to name a few, provided 5-star luxury customer service to fulfill and accommodate my requests to the best of their abilities 24/7.

However, one incident that was completely out of their control  BUT affected my balcony sea view  during my stay 10.10.22-10.14.22 as there was a ‚Äúhuge‚Äù cargo ship stuck in the coral beds near the beach line of the resort.  This was the unfortunate result of Super Typhoon Odette (Dec. 16, 2021) that directly hit the island of Cebu.

When I mentioned this to the front desk staff, I was fortunate to talk face to face with the Duty Mgr. Cecille Jane U. Aristan and she completely understood my point of view and was determined to make my stay more enjoyable despite the cargo ship ‚Äúeye-sore‚Äù on the property beachfront.

Within a few minutes, Cecille invited me & family members to experience the VIP Dusit Club Lounge for the remainder of my stay and it was fabulous! The attentive waiter/Bartender staff (Gerson Purgatorio, Kevin Labay) and chefs (Rufa Mae Soria, Irise Sheila Tagnipes, Kent Jules Deovino) were excellent providing the best customer service experience I‚Äôve had on this Cebu Trip!

I would also like to give a shout out to the Concierge (Earvin) and the Activities Staff (Jade, Cindy) for arranging such a wonderful tour of Cebu City & Mactan where we enjoyed learning about the local culture & historical points. (Lapu-Lapu monument, Guitar Factory, Taoist Temple,The Heritage of Cebu Monument, Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, 10,000 roses, etc.)

In closing, I would recommend this 5-star resort to my friends & family as well as other world travelers that are up to experiencing a once in a lifetime stay in beautiful, beachfront Cebu, Philippines.  I look forward to my return trip and stay @ the Dusit Thani as well as another invite to the fabulous Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu resort & their VIP Dusit Club lounge (Make it happen Cecille!! : ) in the near future after all renovations have been completed!

Evening cocktails  (530pm to 730pm), Wireless connectivity at the lounge. 

In the evening, I had an amazing dinner at ""Benjarong Restaurant""; where you can indulge in a true Thai experience at the newest and most exciting Thai restaurant in the Visayas. Benjarong features a blend of traditional taste and modern culinary technique, prepared before you in an open kitchen.  The next day, I had a good buffet breakfast at Tradewinds Cafe where I enjoyed a lot of amazing pastries and buffet international flavors. 

Right after, I chillax at the pool and then had a good lunch (buffet) at The Sports Bar, where you can relax on the deck sipping sunset drinks, playing billiards, catching the big game, and enjoying live entertainment.  Then, in the afternoon, I had an amazing one-hour Spa treatment at ""Namm Spa""; which I'm so recommending especially if you want to destress.

In the evening, I had nice evening drinks at the Club Lounge; where I also enjoyed canapes and finger foods. The next day, had an amazing Breakfast and Afternoon Tea again at the Club Lounge before my flight.

After 3 days 2 nights stay, I really had an amazing time here, and definitely I will go back to Cebu, and will relax and destress at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu Resort, and with Club Lounge Access again. Definitely worth it.",1.0
5.0,"Had a wonderful meal at the Thai restaurant newly opened September 2022. Everything was delicious.  The meal started with a complimentary signature drink personally served by Reyniel who provided excellent service and care throughout the meal. 

I also had a mocktail cucumber basil slush drink.... Very refreshing. 

Then a spicy shrimp salad. Very tasty but I was expecting a salad with more lettuce. It would be better labeled as an appetizer due to limited lettuce. 

My main dish was green curry chicken. Excellent spice and tasty. 

I recommend this place as a great place to go. I was here after sunset but with the windows facing the city and mountains to the west I believe it will be a great view.

2.0,"I do not know where to start as day after day the level of the experience is decreasing ‚Ä¶
First you have to know that the hotel is under renovation works and no announcement at booking time‚Ä¶in the room because they give me one at the level of renovation, on going job can be heard‚Ä¶do you expect that ? 
Second they have decide to off the water without notice ‚Ä¶we do not care to find a shower somewhere but at least to inform the client ‚Ä¶(due to renovation works ‚Ä¶)
Despite all efforts the personal at restaurant is not so experimented (pandemic has killed everywhere) then asking you 3 times your room number or orders ?!?! Is it what we expect from this supposed category of hotel !? 
Btw the quality of the ID finishing is poor many defaults catching the eyes despite an overall picture that will satisfy the eyes but do not look so close‚Ä¶
The sport room  won‚Äôt accommodate more than 10 personnes or you won‚Äôt feel confortable 
Going to the food it is a mixed experience but room service is weak, always something missing, the sunset bar is average when waiting your dishes do not push you to leave without eating (happen to me today after 45mn waiting for a salad and a wrap while the occupation is quiet normal ‚Ä¶ 
Honestly I can understand a lot but without having a strong exigence the hotel is worst 4 stars but not 5 in these actual conditions, I won‚Äôt recommend it for the time and hope that it will improve a lot.

1.0,"We stayed here for 4 days booking a premium club lounge room and summer staycation package. This hotel has several issues the first being a lack of communication. They did not inform us that the club lounge would be closed for the duration of our stay (in other words we paid premium for a service which the hotel knew they wouldn't be delivering and they had not notified us about it either. Secondly upon arrival our initial email said to check-in at the club lounge however we were told it was closed and to wait at reception in 28-30 degree hear we waited 30mins at reception as the hotel had only 3 staff serving a long line of 12-15 people and strangely they did not have a single fan in the whole reception area - quite shocking for a hotel that calls themselves a ""5-star"" hotel, in my books it was more like a 3-star hotel. However that wasn't even the worst part. From day 1 all the way to day 4, we had to constantly remind the staff that we had booked a special package inclusive of drinks and canap√©s and everytime we went to redeem it, none of the staff knew what was going on, each time we wasted 20-30mins explaining our package to the staff, which was 20-30mins less of being able to claim our limited 2 hours of happy hour. Furthermore, ordering any food or drinks involved a consistent 45-60min wait for it to arrive. Whilst there were 15 wait staff standing around doing nothing only one was making drinks, either the staff are unqualified or the hotel doesn't want to pay to train their staff. Either way this meant you could only have a max of 3 drinks in any happy hour session as the bartender was not capable of making any more than that. Furthermore, the room that the hotel had given us on the first night was not the premium king sized room we had booked. Instead it was a room facing the slums of Cebu. The staff failed to tell us that because we had arrived 30mind early our room was unavailable and instead without any communication whatsoever they placed us in a smaller room facing the slums rather than the premium room we booked facing the pool and spa. Mind you this all happened in just the first four hours of our stay but it certainly set the tone for the rest of the trip. On day 2, first thing we did was contact reception to speak to the manager about all these issues, it was not until then that the manager told us that our room was unavailable only because we arrived 30mins early and that's why they placed us in a smaller room which was not the room that we booked. The manager gave us a 30% discount at the spa however this only involved spending more money to redeem that. We note that the manager did not respond or address any of the other issues at the hotel. Food at the hotel was heavily overpriced for the quality and service, a mere burger and fries for 2 and two cocktails costed us around $65AUD. In Australia this kind of food is usually less than $40AUD and is of gourmet quality unlike at this hotel. The most annoying thing above all was having to constantly carry cash around to pay each restaurant at the hotel and we felt that staff wouldn't serve you within 40mins unless they received a tip and sometimes even if they did it wouldn't guarantee fast service. Finally, the only perk of the hotel is it's infinity pool however most of the time all the seats by the pool are full as they also allow day guests and often towels run out too. Will definitely not be visiting this hotel or Cebu ever again.",0.0

1.0,"The property is old and there is a lot of renovation work going on in the resort. The rooms were smelly and I had to get them to clean the bathroom twice as the bathroom floor was not cleaned well before we could check in . There is some open drain in the room which was quite smelly . I have a feeling it is from the sink in the kitchen area . Furniture is old , and nothing fancy to call the room 5 star resort . The bathroom door doesn‚Äôt close well , so the water kept coming out of the shower enclosure and messing up the other area . The food options are very limited , and their specialty restaurant was quite a disappointment with respect to the taste of the food . The staff everywhere was quite welcoming and warm though . 
The room service was taking forever . Even a bottle of water takes 15 mins at least to get delivered . The bottles of water they provide are 350 ml and you would end up taking more of those bottles as they are too small . Being such a big brand , they have not been environmentally conscious . They are on using small single use plastic bottles for everything.  It is unacceptable . Would make more sense yo have a water purification plant on the premises or use bigger bottles to give water . The cost of everything is unreasonably expensive for no damn reason . And they are all excluding VAT which is something new we saw. 
The just got my period and needed a sanitary pad and they were going to charge me 100 pesos for one pad . I got furious with this . 

We stayed at Radisson blue for two days before this and moved there to have a nice resort feel . But Radisson was 1000 times better in every aspect . Costed lesser , better service , better food , amazing rooms and room service . 

Would recommend not to go the Dusit Thani . They are just trying to over charge for everything without any reason .",0.0
4.0,"We went to Cebu and stayed at the Dusit Thani, the hotel was good but some works were being carried out due the damage from the recent hurricane (I think).
The hotel itself was big though in my opinion a little secluded and out of the way. If you want to stay here and get around then hire a car or scooter, we hired a scooter so was good for us, if you just want to stay and relax then all good.
The swimming pool excellent with great views. There was a boat not so far from the hotel that had been washed up by the recent hurricane which I‚Äôm sure will be salvaged soon enough. The staff were great and friendly though I did find it strange that we had to inform reception to have our room made up daily.
Food at the hotel was decent and the breakfast was buffet style depending how busy the hotel was, a few times during our stay the breakfast was Ala carte and the breakfast location changing due to the hotel not being so busy during the week days.
The bedroom was fine and spacious with a pool view and cleaned daily once reception had been notified, the rooms were also quite modern with the usual refinements expected from a Dusit Thani Hotel.",0.75

3.0,"The hotel is at the end of a peninsula on Mactan island and pretty much isolated from rest of metro Cebu. The room was fine‚Ä¶nice sea view with balcony. King  size bed was really comfortable. The quirky bathroom had a shower with separate tub and no door leaving a wet mess in front of sink. 
The lobby, dining areas, huge infinity pool and beach were really appealing. Considering the devastation of the recent typhoon they have made quite a comeback.
Now, I give it just 3-stars because of food and service. The breakfast buffet was very good‚Äînice assortment of breads, meats, fresh fruit and eggs dishes. Meal Service  was mostly quick and friendly. The other meals were off the menu and were bland and way overpriced. For example the ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù salad was a concoction of chopped up tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers with barely visible feta cheese and olives served warm. 
Room service in this caliber of resort should be performed daily without request but it was not‚Äîeven when requested.
Other missteps included charging our 9 yo for breakfast buffet when it was including in the booking; charging my Visa card in US dollars when Pesos were specifically requested resulting in an exchange skewed in their favor; telling us, in front of our visiting relative, that we must pay 1000 Pesos because she went in the pool.

He was professional and courteous towards us the entire time. We were a big group with 3 senior citizens and a baby so you can imagine we were needing assistance most of the time, yet he and a few of his workers didn't show any sign of complaint or annoyance and just focused on assisting us. 

Safety measures against COVID were well-placed as a staff was assigned by the buffet to spray alcohol on our hands before eating, and we were required to wear plastic gloves while getting food so as to not contaminate the serving spoons, ladles, etc. Food trays were always full and the lines didn't get too long as they were managing it to avoid crowding the buffet area.

Beach was nice, the salty air and the serene summer view of the sea while chilling in the pool was so relaxing.

What a disappointment!!!
The hotel
It‚Äôs self is in a bad way the damage from the typhoon last year has not been addressed instead there are miles of Caution tape everywhere reception is at a makeshift desk handrails are missing from walkways and from stairs.

Check in was as unpleasant as the building it‚Äôs self
No greeting no smile very much pushing to upsell and upgrade.

Once at the room we were shocked at the fact it was so unclean and the smell of urine emanating from the bathroom was disgusting 
This was brought up with housekeeping and the manager but to no avail and we were left to clean the room and bathroom ourselves.

The pool is nice but unfortunately someone had vomited in the kiddie end which was never cleaned during the day after bringing it to the staff attention 

During breakfast there was no decaf coffee available unless you pay extra no tea available unless you pay extra.
The staff in the restaurant are very good and very helpful especially Imee who tried so hard to help and make everything rite.

There seems to be a lack of customer care with the management and the feeling is to upsell at every opportunity.

Having spoken with the manager twice regarding the concerns it was decided it‚Äôs better we move to a different hotel which he had no objection to and quickly cancelled the remaining days of our stay.

Very unprofessional approach to guests and unfortunately this is what is been fed down through the staff.

It pains me to have to write such a bad review but feel it is important to share the experience with others.

Hopefully this can be addressed and this hotel can reach the standards of other Hotels in the Dusit Thani Group",0.0
4.0,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 

The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness. Props to Matthew who checked us in very quickly at 9PM when we arrived.

The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entrees though need to have more variety. I ordered the inasal and it was excellent. So were the frozen mojitos. 

Their famous Thai restaurant Benjarong was closed due to repairs from the typhoon. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant.  There is a buffet available at one of the restaurant but since we are still living in the time of COVID, I thought is would not be prudent to do so. There is a deli that serves good coffee and okay sandwiches. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the shoreline of property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom in our room though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

The resort is located on the far end of Mactan Island so be prepared to stay in because it's far away from everything else. My daughter and I stayed in for three days and two nights and we did not get bored.

As I walked round early morning talking with fellow residents and staff and working out what we could do I thought I would see if the Dusit was open and much to my relief and surprise they were looking at taking some people in despite damage to parts of the hotel ...a number of us checked in with an indefinite exit date until our places were back up and running which ended up taking a month or so. 

I cannot  thank nor praise the GM , Michael and all of the Dusit team where despite the difficult circumstances they made our 'refugee - like' stay a complete pleasure and I was hugely impressed with how they pulled off memorable Christmas and New Year Eve parties with great food and good humour - much needed antidotes to the ongoing challenges with the tidy up, restoring power and water runs required  on the domestic front.

I got to know th the team very well and the warmth and kindness as well as service made my stay feel like a second family and I am very grateful for all their support and help. 

In times of crisis you really get to see how people are and to a man/woman the Dusit truly stepped up and will be forever in memory as a shining light during difficult times.

Thanks Michael and your team! and will be seeing you soon...",1.0
5.0,What a lovely space! We had just come from a required post overseas trip quarantine period in another hotel in Cebu City but as luck would have it couldn‚Äôt go home because one of two house guests had covid. So we opted to have a staycation by the sea and decided to try the Dusit to wait out the Big O visiting my home. It was a great decision. We had such a feeling of space and freshness. Our Seaview room was very comfortable and we spent part of every afternoon by the 100m long pool.  And the food was very good too! So all in all I have to say that I would love to staycation at the Dusit again and I will.,1.0

4.0,"The check-in process was fast, and early check-in was allowed since it was available. The first impression of the hotel showed it looked a bit aged, but it is still in good condition and usable. The room was large, and the bathroom was spacious. However, the room lacked a welcoming vibe on the first day, which was unexpected for a 5-star hotel. The outdated carpet design and antique chairs in front of the elevators contributed to the aged appearance.

The balcony provided a relaxing view of greenery, even though it was far from the beach. kids thoroughly enjoyed the playroom and Pororo Park, although the latter was quite expensive for its medium size. The pools were big and enjoyable, and the lazy river was a highlight. The resort offers a variety of entertainment facilities such as mini-golf, a playground, an activity room, go-karts, and slides. The toddlers‚Äô pool was particularly loved by the kids, and the Amazon River attraction was a standout feature. Various water activities are also available, adding to the fun.

Food prices were on the higher side with an average taste, but the serving sizes were acceptable. There are many nearby restaurants if you prefer dining out. The buffet breakfast was average, and the lunch buffet restaurant itself felt too expensive for the limited selection. However, the 100% natural juice was a highlight. The restaurant personnel were very professional and well-trained. Room service was available through a barcode menu only, with no printed copies, which did not attract us to dine in our room.

The pool design has areas with varying depths, so children need to be supervised carefully. The Wi-Fi was strong but unusable in the rooms, which was a significant inconvenience. It is recommended that someone from management check in for one night with an iPhone to personally experience and address the Wi-Fi issues along with any other areas needing improvement. The poolside entertainment, including Zumba, live singing, and a fire dance, was a delightful addition, and hot towels were provided after swimming.

Additional facilities such as a fitness center, spa, and gym are available, along with huge function halls. Other amenities include an ATM, casino, and photo studio. However, gift shops and necessity shops were hard to find. The presence of ‚Äúno smoking‚Äù signs in the room was unusual and a bit annoying for a 5-star establishment. The staff were helpful and responsive to complaints, making efforts to address any issues seriously. Both check-in and check-out processes were fast and efficient.

Not at this place! Guests look so sour, I mean you are in the Phillipines would it kill you to smile. The facilities are OK. OK pool, we opted for buffet dinner at the Abalone restaurant and the staff were attentive and the food plentiful. We paid 500 pesos to use the little cars for 30 minutes and 100 pesos to use the go carts for 15 minutes. Pool staff were lovely and attentive and the lifeguards were exceptional. My kids spent all day in the water and we just lounged around. This hotel seems to cater especially for guests from Korea whereas Shangri La had a more international crowd. I would advise you take the dinner option rather than the lunch set menu. Seeing the place in the night was a different perspective, pororo meets the kids and there was a fire show. Still didn't justify the cost, it was an ok experience and I probably would not visit again.",0.25

4.0,"We had a memorable staycation at Jpark. It was our baby girl's birthday and she had a marvelous time. 
As a family that loves to travel together, we have tried almost all the good beach resorts in Lapu-lapu city, Cebu. There are negative things we noticed immediately upon arriving at the resort. One, most of the areas in the resort needs maintenance and cleaning. The pools looked clean but the drains were really dirty. However, the pros to Jpark are more than enough to make your stay great! We stayed in a big room with a King bed at the new Jpark Tower. Even with a kingsize bed, chair with stool, baby cot/crib AND and extra bed the room was still very spacious. Big enough for our infant to crawl around when we stayed in the room. We are impressed with the room size however, as with the rest of the resort, it also needs maintenance. We did not have hot water for showering but its not a big deal. What the Resort have that overly compensates for its shortcomings is the CUSTOMER SERVICE and their FOOD. They have a good variety of good food with reasonable prices. We ate at our favorite Nonki and Maru restaurants and tried their chinese Ching Hai restaurant. We have breakfast at Abalone and snacks at Aquos and before we left ate at the Coral restaurant. They all have tasty and good for value foods. But the best part about this resort is their customer service. Most of their staff were accommodating and non-discriminating between foreigners and locals. However some staff were above standard and made the extra effort to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Miss Jomarie at the reception front desk made us feel welcome right from our arrival. She listened to all our requests and did all that she can to accommodate. Kevin at the infinity pool was also noteworthy. As simple as offering to help inflate our baby floaters gave us more time to enjoy playing with our kids. And before we left, Bingbong of the Abalone restaurant left an unforgetable impression to our family and made us think we want to come back just to eat at the Coral Restaurant. He and Mario gave Excellent service and Bingbong later offered the kids to a fishfeeding experience. He took our family photos with enthusiasm and when we said thank you his response was unforgettable. He said ""No, i should be the one to thank you because you chose Jpark Resort"". Amazing! 

The thing also worth mentioning is the Pororo Park. Aside from being ridiculously expensive (2,000 pesos for 2 hours), i felt that it was not worth the extra spend with all the fun things we can do outside (the weather was amazing) instead of indoors.",0.75

3.0,"I have stayed at JPark 3 times over the last 5 years. Most recently with my wife and kids.

At a high level it looks like the perfect resort to stay at with kids. The problem is the place is going downhill fast and the owners are not doing proper maintenance.

We had three rooms this weekend and all of them smelled terrible like mildew or mold or something. The kind of smell that hits you in the face when you walk in the room.

The resort clearly needs new carpet.

The TVs in the room are very small and the system it uses is ancient and not a good experience.

The WiFi was terrible. Unusable.

I went back to my room at midnight one night and couldn't get in my own room. The key card wouldn't work. I had to go to the front desk to get a new key. With amazing Filipino hospitality they even walked me back to my room to assist me. 

We then figured out about 30 minutes later that the problem was my hotel room door didn't properly close. The key card wouldn't work because the door wasn't actually locked. The only way to lock the door was to slam it hard. The door jam didn't line up. The poor guy helping me from the front desk couldn't even figure out what was wrong.

One of the best things about JPark is the nice hot shower. That is something that is hard to find in the Philippines. Sadly, the faucet in the same bathroom was leaking and needed to be replaced. Maintenance not being performed.

The pool is one thing that is functional but you can see paint fading due to lack of upkeep. The pools are excellent and probably the only reason they are in business.

The buffet is a strength for the resort but it is pretty expensive for the Philippines. It's around $30 a person. Overall the food was great.

Pororo Park is about $30 for you and all the real rides and attractions were for whatever reason closed when I was there. Basically we got a playground, trampoline, some building blocks, a water table, and slide for $30. It did keep my son busy for an hour so I still consider it a win.

There is no beach at JPark. There is some sand and then rocks in the water. Don't expect any sort of good beach experience at JPark. Go somewhere else or island hopping if you want a dream beach experience.

When we went before the D Thrones ride on cars were one of my favorite parts. Now they best summarize the entirety of JPark.

They are all broken and no longer available. The amusing part is there are still signs all over the grounds about them. They are too lazy to fix or replace them and then too lazy to at least take the signs down about them.

JPark could be a 5 star resort. Right now it is exactly O.K. and honestly only in business because it doesn't have any real competition. It's super popular for Korean tourists for some reason.

The management team needs to get it together and do proper maintenance. ",0.5

Upon reflection, we strongly suspect that the source of these insect bites might have been the pillow in the room.

2.0,"Disappointed that this hotel was listed as a 5 star property. I will begin with the check in process. It was quick. We got our room fairly fast but I wasn‚Äôt pleased when I went for a swim & ordered a drink at the swim up bar &  my rm# & name  wasn‚Äôt given the option to do room charge as form of payment. In my wet swim suit attire I had to walk to the front desk to ask why. I was then told by the front desk receptionist that the reason why was I had to  pay a 9,000 PHP charge on our account to proceed. This wasn‚Äôt even communicated to me. And that was when my frustration grew. If we knew this we would‚Äôve saved ourselves the embarrassment & waste of time at the pool bar. I mean after all a 5 star property would offer that experience as a courtesy, speaking of the room charge that is. It was embarrassing. The property could use a face lift at that. Including our Pool Villa. It smelled like a public toilet the whole time. I even called the front desk to have someone spray the bathroom so it wouldn‚Äôt smell like feces or a cesspool of a sewer. The decor of the pool was also a let down as some faux grass boards were missing but without it that detail showed sub par contracting work. It just screamed negligence in addition to the moss forming on the door corners. The concept of the pool villa was cool but for 5 minutes and I would honestly recommend it for 1 night only to experience a private pool. The upkeep or the feeling of this room to feel stress free & clean isn‚Äôt worth it. We ordered IRD a couple of times (we stayed from here 7/19- 7/22) and when asked a room service staff member if they could pick up the dirty dishes after we ate they told me ‚Äúmaybe if it‚Äôs not raining‚Äù. This is unacceptable. Another night we ordered from Nonki, the Japanese Restaurant apart of the resort and due to a private function take out was the only option. But when our family of 4 was done eating we had to put all the garbage outside of our room because we had bags worth of trash not picked up. We heard the street cats digging into the bags in the middle of the night.  
I really wanted to have a great experience here with my family however it was the opposite. I recommend not taking the pool Villa for more than 1x night. You‚Äôre better off getting a clean smelling room. Over all I‚Äôd say JPark is definitely a novelty resort for kids but don‚Äôt expect 5 star service. Expect 3.5 and you won‚Äôt be disappointed. The Pororo Park is great for small children, my 7 month old enjoyed it as well as my 4 year old but best to enjoy when the 3h window begins at 1500 php per kid. I hope this place improves. I won‚Äôt be returning though.",0.25
1.0,"2nd time at jpark.  My kids contracted hand foot mouth disease starting with my toddler who only went to pororo park and the water park. After reading other reviews it seems like it happens quite often here. Most likely from pororo park. Emailed reservations about it over a week ago. No reply. Very disappointing from a supposedly 5 star hotel which it definitely is not thus the 1 star. Management should look into their customer service or rather lack of it. 

Lifeguards on the red swirling slide  and the blue slide were also not careful and hit my daughter on the head twice. 

Facilities need upkeep. Wave pool and other slides not working. 

Water is overpriced. 110 for a small bottle of regular bottled water. More expensive than shang mactan.

4.0,"Great resort to take your kids!

Good: Lots of activities to do. The waterpark was fun for the kids. My 11-year old loved the slides. 

Breakfast food was ok, more impressive though was despite the resort being fully booked, there were more than enough tables for the guests.

Restaurant food were good but like any hotel resorts, price is on the high end. I actually loved the Japanese restaurant just outside the main Jpark building. 

Room was nice. Nothing special but bust comfortable enough to get your rest after a whole day of swimming and playing.

Pororo Park was fun for the kids, but quite a pain on the parents‚Äô pockets‚Ä¶I think they can lower the cost a bit and then lessen the time spent (instead of 3 hours maybe just 2).

Needs improvement: Towels! Only resort I‚Äôve been to where there are always lack of beach/pool towels for the guests. One time we went there around 7:30am (pool opens at 7am) and the towels were not ready yet!

Rooms have no bidets. 

Overall, it was a fun family trip for us! The kids loved it and enjoyed the activities the resort offered!",0.75
4.0,"We stayed here 4 days and 3 nights here for the children's birthday trip. Our booking is a package for their Mactan Suite with breakfast, spa, cocktails at the Hacana By The Bay and discounts for other amenities. Prior arrival, I made sure during reservation that a birthday set-up will be prepared in the room ( to suprise my children and make them feel special for their birthday vacation), to my suprise, as per Reservation, they do not offer such thing ( taje note, I am a hotelier mysrlf and all hotels have different birthday set-up to make guest feel special during their stay) Jpark is a 5 star waterpark resort so I guess i expected a lot. Anyway, I then just ask for a cake which i will pay,to be placed in the room before we arrive. Arrival, room is not ready due to high occupancy, so I reminded the Front office regarding the set-up i made with the Reservation. When the room is finally ready, the cake i arranged was not there. I made a follow up in their Call Center at around 3 30pm and was tild to wait for a feedback. Hours passed, no call was returned to me. We are preparing to leave to meet the family for a dinner outside the resort. Then we heard a knock and when i opened tge door, there was a delivery of a cake. I asked the waiter on who ordered the cake, he answered that it is complimentary to our room. Now im confused, the suprise cake was never arranged as agreed, the cake i followed up never got clarified for hours, now, complinentary cake? I have to discuss it with the management to clear things out. Gladly, Mr,Ryan Garcia ( Duty Manager) was there to hwar my confusion and complaints. He gave me rhe assurance that it will be discussed and investigated.  Thanks ro him our firsr visit and first night  in the resort didn't end up tragic and disappointing.
Fast forward to the rest of our stay. The kids enjoyed the slides and Amazon ricer a lot. But you must be prepared to be early even if the slides opens at 10am . Towels are already lying on the pool beds when you get there late.  Breakfast is a feast but again, you have to be prepared to line up and see a lot of people. They do have very high occupancy during our stay,especially with korean groups. The room we had waa very spacious because we booked a suite, we noticed some dirt issues in the barhroom but aside thatbthe room was comfortable enough. We also had a spa at Cara Spa which me and my husband enjoys a lot, it is an high-end facility where you will feel like a queen and king with their service and facility. 

Cuatomer Service, front office 3/5 ( lacks communication skills and empathy) , call center 2/5 (all calls i made that needed call back never happened cake, water dipper) Restaurant 5/5 (they are cery friendly and helps all guest as possible)

Overall, 3.5/5 for our entire stay, it ciuld have been worse if not for Mr. Rran. I wished we couls thank him personally but was not able to. Will we come back? Possibly,because the kids had fun but we are hoping they will be able to improve on all the lapses they had. ",0.75

2. The room is dusty and smells weird. Me and my kids started to sneeze and cough few moments we enter the room.
3. During the room cleaning, we are asked they first if we want the bedsheet to be changed which is I think should be automatically changed. No sweeping or vacuuming of the floor was done.
4. There's no food menu in the room. We have to call and follow up every 20 mins for the menu to be sent. The food is good and fast.
5. We call for an extra towel on the first day for the kids but nothing was sent. We request again on the second day and made follow every 20 mins finally they sent it.
6. There are some activities that has to be paid by cash on the spot and don't allow us to charge to our room. It's a bit troublesome to bring lots of cash around the resort. I don't understand what is the purpose of our deposit.
7.  The shower drain is always clogged we have to call staff to fix it every time.  We have to follow up every 20 mins before someone comes to fix it.  We have to put our shower time on hold because of that.",0.0

1.0,"3rd time visiting this property and it was terrible. We used our ‚Äúvoucher‚Äù in the Cabanas  during the visit. When my Mom order some foods, she was decline that they can‚Äôt serve foods from other outlets and was only offered the pica2x. I was shocked since our previous visit we ordered the same foods and it was served in the cabanas. 

When I arrived, they only ordered the pica2x. So I asked one of the servers that we will order our usual foods that we like. I told them that we are in Cabana 1 and we would like to request for a staff to take our orders in the Cabana. I presumed they are busy since it is Mother‚Äôs Day today so my sister went to Abalone to order. My sister was told that they can only offer take out orders even if they are told we are staying in the Cabana. 

After 1 hour, no one approached us if the foods were ready to pick up. When I went to the towel counter thats the time I was informed that our order was ready to pick up. When I arrived in Abalone, I asked the cashier what time the foods were ready and she said it was ready 15 minutes ago. I asked them why they did not informed me and she just answered she called the towel counter but the staff there did not do anything. I asked her if they can send some glass of water in the cabana and she just said to ask one of the staff near the pool. So they can‚Äôt even assist me with my request. Where is the service here?. (They are not busy when I arrived since 80% of the tables were empty!)

When we started eating, they prepared plastic spoon and fork in the take away plastic. No plates!. What is this, Fast Food service?!. No initiative to provide us a better plates, and utensils when they know we are in the Cabana. 

They lack training. No follow through, No Initiative, and No Genuine care. To think today is Mother‚Äôs Day. I spoke to their F&B Manager and told him everything. Our previous visit was very good compared to our visit today is 1 out of 10. He insisted to give a service recovery but thats not the purpose why I requested for a manager. He was persistent so I requested for a glass of ice instead. 

Be consistent with your service. Hopefully when we visit again (IF), there is an improvement done. ",0.0

5.0,"We booked this resort as a 6-night family holiday with our 3yr old daughter.

This is a huge resort with a beautiful waterpark and quite a few things to do.

Check-in was fast and easy. The desk clerk even allowed my wife to physically see some rooms so we could choose the one that best suited our needs.

We got a 1 bedroom sea-view room that had plenty of space complete with a small balcony and an area to hang our wet swimsuits and towels.

The room was clean and well-furnished.
The kitchen area had a sink, kettle, and a countertop to eat lunch if you ordered room service.
Off to the side is a half bath, great for not having to go into the bedroom to use the toilet.

The bedroom was large with a walk-through closet and separate toilet area as well as a separate oversize bathtub and shower area.
The water pressure was excellent, so having a nice warm shower after swimming all day was comforting.

There are a few different restaurants to choose from, but be cautious as the prices on the menu won't be the same on your bill. There are added taxes and surcharges so be sure to watch out for them and inquire immediately to your server or restaurant manager.

The Coral restaurant right on the ocean is calming and has beautiful views, the perfect setting for a nice dinner. The food was of good quality as well.

The staff was ALL friendly and nice, with no issues at all.

The breakfast buffet is huge and offers a lot of different dishes and drinks.

There is a small entertainment in the evenings beside the main pool consisting of fire dancers and 2 female singers.

There are a lot of stores and restaurants outside the resort, just walk out the gate and there are all over the place.

The waterpark has areas for all ages. Since our daughter is 3, we stayed around the kiddie area where there are many slides and water activities. She also loved the river rafts, that went in a circle and had fun getting wet from all the sprinkles throughout the course.

There is a casino on the site but the minimum bet is $20usd chips.

We had a very good time and would highly recommend this to other families that are looking for a nice relaxing holiday.

Just Okay
- The pool is not very deep, most likely for safety reasons, but it is still enjoyable.
- The beach sand area is too small, not advisable to use on peak days

3.0,"My wife and I live in Cebu city. Our building took a hit from Odette. We have lived with construction noise for months. So we needed a getaway. I paid the most I ever have paid for a hotel in the Philippines and booked a M-F room at this hotel. The place was on the wife‚Äôs bucket list.  With my booking I sent a request for a quiet room. I got a form letter response. That annoyed me, what kind of customer service is that for a 5 star ? So I sent an e mail through the site I booked the hotel. No response. Now I was mad so I sent an e mail to the web site of J Park, no reply. Finally I sent Jason Wu‚Äôs food company an e mail to be forwarded to him telling the millionaire owner his customer service stunk. No response. When we checked in I told the woman who checked me in I tried repeatedly to get a human response to my request for a quiet room and never got a response. So I told her all I care about is a quiet room. Well we check in go to the pool come back are settling into our room and WHAM super loud disco and an obnoxiously loud MC coming from an event by the pool. My head exploded. No blackout curtains in a room that faced the sun and no soundproofing in the room.  I complained and was told initially that I was given a schedule of events when I checked in. It was not until telling the hotel manager I would have any further conversation with his superiors we were offered a room upgrade. We transferred the next day to a quiet room with blackout curtains the room had what once must have been a beautiful ocean themed rug but how would you know it was filthy. Some Five star. The towels in the room were Motel 6 quality. I mean come on a Five star with heinous towels ? The hits just kept on coming. 4 days we were there not once did the water in the shower get hot. You are a supposed Five star with a beach and pools and you have awful towels and no hot water in the bathrooms‚Ä¶..some Five star. My wife loved the breakfast which had great COVID protocols me ? Four days every day my eggs were cold. How do you have a hot plate a warming light and the eggs are cold ? Usually Five stars have an omelet station here no so much. Coffe which I always expect to be awesome at a five star was Folgers quality meh. Oh the food story gets better we went to the Japanese resturant by the front gate it was the only superior meal we had the wife‚Äôs fish and my sashimi and sushi were quite good. The other place Coral very hit or miss. One night we had the best nacho‚Äôs I have had since living in Cebu, but the shrimp we ordered were rubber. Last night there the wife had a very nice crab meal, my entree was served with cold vegetables. This stuff is resturant 101 how does a supposed Five star consistently serve cold or substandard food ? They charge you not cheaply for the food there are expectations involved here. So make your expectations very low for food at this place. One note from the pics it looks like a white sand beach. The beach is all rocks. You need water shoes which I did not have. I cut my foot and the bottoms of my feet hurt for days afterwards so remember your ocean slippers. All in all we got what we came for. The wife and my boy loved the water park and the sea. The grounds are lovely the staff almost too helpful. I still do not understand how there is always someone around to take my empty plate or cater to me but every time I ordered a cocktail it took 15 minutes to arrive, I needed to order my second when the first arrived, sadly I was not that smart. So remember you pay for the kIds. Me the person who has stayed at other five stars and paid the most for a hotel room in the Philippines ever ‚Ä¶.I felt robbed. Hijacked. There are three or four other places on the same island just as good for half the price. Whomever is in charge of giving out stars for this place obviously was paid off or the resort bribed a service to be called a five star it is a three star at best.",0.5

Slides and other parts of the resort is under maintainance/ repair...its quite understandable esp after being hit by a strong typhoon several months ago, but they shouldve advised us and set our expectation before us finalizing our booking. 
Staff - though they are couteous, it couldve been better if they greet their clients proactively.  The pool staff should not be staying in one place  3 to 4  of them, just talking. 
Theres a lot of part of the resort arr also deteriorating esp the rails going up the slides.

We had booked a Villa with private pool for the two weeks which was great being able to walk straight out of the bedroom into the pool on a morning.

We tried all but one of the restaurants in the hotel as well as in room dining, all was good and tried all sorts of food that had not tried before, especially local Philippine dishes as that was one reason for visting there.

Getting around the area was mostly by the use of taxi, for which there was a lot around, as well as wanting, and succeeding, trying the local trikes.

They even attempted to offer us a room that was declined by the other guests. It was very insulting! They said that our room is not ready yet despite of it being pre-booked and paid. Other guests who arrived after us, (Koreans) were immediately escorted to there rooms, while we were in the lobby. While we were there 3 more guests of other nationalities went past by us. It was only when I complained that they allowed us to go to our room! That was almost 30 minutes after. 

I Was told that it's alright not to leave a security deposit and just pay for whatever services we need. Okay. 

During the night, my mom arrived and was in reception, I told the operator over the phone that I need to take a shower and will pay right after. She said okay. I thought she's sending my mom to our room. But no she didn't. I finished showering, and waited for 20 more minutes. Then i went downstairs. She didn't send my mom upstairs because I need to pay additional 2000php because i didn't leave any deposit. It's not like we can escape and leave it unpaid! We paid for an overnight stay! And while we were there a family of another nationality came and was told that they can pay later since they were staying over night. So were we!

4.0,We went here to enjoy a family welcome home trip. Haven't been home since covid hit and decided to come here to celebrate coming home.  First off the entrance is stunning just beautiful. They follow check ins very closely so if your trying to check in early be prepared to pay a 1500 peso fee. Sadly that's just the start of the upsells. Get to the room and a beautiful room and the free waters and coffee is great. Sadly our room wasn't fully cleaned and found a previous guests dirty towel behind the seat pillows on the couch. Had to wait for almost an hour for housekeeping to get.  Went to get the breakfast next am and that was a let down. If you going with any kids over 13 be prepared to pay. They only allow 2 adults and one kid under 13. Any children over 13 is a adult and you have to pay. The food was great not so much the upsell. The water park is ok but once again children get screwed out of it. The slides cannot be used by anyone under the age of 18. So that removes alot of the fun for them. Sadly only the pool is covered in your room fees. Porororo park is a separate fee to use. Any of the activities such as mini golf walking chess and the pedal bikes are all also fees. So if you are coming with family be prepared to pay alot to do things for family.,0.75

3.0,"I am a big fan of this hotel resort (back when it was called Imperial Palace) until our last stay which was just this June 2022. To be honest the only selling point of this Hotel Resort is, of course, the Waterpark. It's only good for families with kids who will surely enjoy the swimming pools and slides. These are what I notice from our recent stay:

1. The lobby and check-in area looks old. It's high time that they elevate it.

2. Abalone, their buffet restaurant, still looks old and the same from the past years we have visited it. Breakfast buffet spread were all the same each day. Mactan Shangri-la is way better with their buffet options.

3. Our room is old. We opt for 2 bedroom suite since we are 4 adults. It was a long walk from the main lobby as it it in the farthest bldg in the property (ocean view) The TV was like from the 2000s and the bath tub has alot of dirt from its hardware material. I was looking forward to have a hot tub but didnt bother to use it anymore. Fridge looks old, dining table is old, every furniture is old. What we only liked here is the view but of course it comes with a price.

4. Dont waste your time in the beach area. Until now its not as sophisticated as Movenpick and Shangri-la. Lots of big stones and the rightmost side of the area is still undeveloped.

To the property owner, do not settle for being branded only as a ""Waterpark"" its now high time that you keep up with technology and change slowly everything inside your property such as furnitures and fixtures. Guests can have best of both worlds with old stylish with a hint of modernism.

Will we ever go back? not anymore. I just find this hotel tired. Will look forward to other beach resorts with modern ambiance (maybe Dusit). If Movenpick wasnt destroyed by the typhoon, it would be our first option to be honest, Jpark please keep up!",0.5

I was able to get the 21 day advance purchase rate for a two bedroom suite. I didn‚Äôt know that the room that will be given to me was an old and un-refurbished room. It didn‚Äôt even have bidets in either of the bathrooms. Shouldn‚Äôt bidets be basic nowadays? No microwave in the room too.

My brother in Law, who also booked the same room category for the same exact rate got a newer room with bidets and a microwave.

My kids loved the Pororo suite room. One tile by the shower area was loose already and the water drain in the shower went down very slowly. At the foot of the beds in the room, there are wooden feet of the characters of the specific bed. It‚Äôs an accident waiting to happen. You should put foam or thick padding on those wooden feet to protect kids from getting hurt. Some of the balls in the ball pit were cracked open or literally sliced in half already. I had to remove all of them to avoid my kids from getting scratched from the broken balls.

Most of the staff were well mannered and pleasant, however most of them also assumed you know how to speak bisaya. As a property claiming to be 5 stars, shouldn‚Äôt English be your primary language there?

5 stars right? FOOD should have been great!!! It is far from great! The only good food we had in the property was from the Japanese resto in the premises called Nonki. And it‚Äôs a third party resto.

Property is beautiful and really a dream destination for kids. But it is very far from being a 5 Star property.

You guys need to hire a new F&B Director and Executive Chef. Food quality is of a 2-3 star hotel. Buffet area food was cold and sloppy.

I‚Äôm just glad that my kids had fun and as kids, did not notice these things that I‚Äôve mentioned. Then again, it‚Äôs the adults your property need to impress right?",0.25

5.0,"I was fortunate to have the opportunity to try the hotel for a night stay and was warmly welcomed by Jessica, the Front Desk Manager, as she did the check-in. I was very impressed with her professionalism and friendliness, and she checked us in.

When we enter the room, the room is modern and elegant with a beautiful view of the beach. The room is big, the placements of furniture are well thought of and the attention of details is impeccable. The hotel room is really modern and chic. One of the features of the room that I really like is that it has a very modern toilet. It also has a very impressive shower with a reasonable size that comes with rain shower. The overall comfort of our room was superb and certainly has a nice ambience about it. The bed is really comfortable, and I had a wonderful night of sleep. I will recommend this hotel to my family, friends and members of Anytime Fitness Cebu IT Park branch.",1.0
2.0,"The pros: The people, super service oriented. The pools, big, with wet-bar, options for kids in the waterpark, games inside like volley and basket. The food is very good, although on a very limited menu.

The cons: Wanna play any of the ""entertainment"" offering they sale? PAY. You arrive couple hours before check-in and the room is available? PAY to get before 2pm. Wanna transport from-to Airport included after paying +u$250/night? PAY.

I really had the feeling of a very much profitability oriented hotel than customer oriented hotel. ONLY free entertainment offer was Darts, which were broken. I had to pay u$2 for 30min of a Ping Pong Table. 

I expect much more from such a pricey and supposedly 5* Hotel.

I spent 3 days in Moalboal after Jpark, on a u$80/night room and I had Pool, Foosball table, PingPong, BoardGames, and more, all included in the hotel rate.",0.25
5.0,"This is the best place to stay with family with kids!

2.0,"The resort boasts that it is a 5 star resort but it doesn't feel like it to me.

Given there are a few positive things we can highlight.

1. The resort is huge, it is very suitable to families with kids who want to go on vacation. Their water park is definitely the highlight of the resort.
2. Staff were approachable and courteous.
3. Guests have lots of activities they can try.

Now on to the not so great things that the resort can improve on.

1. The lobby of the resort has a chaotic feel to it, given that it was a weekend and still in the middle of a pandemic. As a guest my family and I felt lost during the check.in process and no one had helped us with our baggages. We had to meander in the hotel ourselves.
2. Check-in process takes a long time.
3. Rooms are outdated, not that spacious and everything you request from a bucket full of ice to a bottle of water is charged.
4. My family reserved 4 rooms altogether, with an extra bed in each room and never in my life saw an extra bed at a 5 star resort setup from the floor. It was just a literal mattress, laid flat on the floor no folding bed at that! The blanket was very thin which made it more disappointing. 
5. The amenities weren't that great either, the public restroom near the main pool was disgusting. It smelled awful and looked like it wasn't maintained well. It felt like we were at a low class pool resort.
6. The staff did their best ig, but the guest services hotline is no longer available at 9pm.
7. Breakfast service was good in a mediocre kind of way, not much variety of choice given that it was a weekend. 
8. Definitely an experience we wont be repeating, if you're a family who likes to chill then there are better resorts in the area who give better service and amenities.

The drinks are professional and mixed perfectly...

While the Pororo Park may be targeted for kids eight and under...parents and kids of any age will enjoy the 5D adventures...

I know most of the local traveler look for a reasonable place to stay

This 5 star resort is highly recommended for Family with Kids

The pools are great  and my kids love the slides stay there more than an hour

Food : Big serving for 1000 pesos a nice meal for 2 adult and 2 kids
Activity : All are affordable from 100 to 300 pesos ( Except Jetski which is also discounted 1200 for 15mins)

3.0,"I would say that although it is a 5-star hotel, their Cebu Suite didn't really have ""the vibe"" upon entering the living room. Also, and most importantly, they have a broken POS that they already knew about because it happened so many times but didn't do anything about it. I don't know if it's their internet or their device but it was so annoying on our end especially that we had to personally go to our bank to have it resolved and it stretched on for days. So just a tip, don't pay with debit card bc it's really hassle AF! The place is really great for kids though, not so much for adults. AND GREAT BREAKFAST BUFFET!!!! Actually the best thing about the place.",0.5
5.0,"My daughters always prefer a staycation over a party for their birthday. We‚Äôve been to many other resorts but they always prefer to go back to JPark!

It‚Äôs their happy place, very safe for children. They get to run around the whole place and swim from one pool to the other, try all the slides to their heart‚Äôs contents while mama and papa chills by the beach.

The staff are very friendly and accomodating, and there are many other activities that can be enjoyed by all members of the family.

Every year for the past 8-9 years, we‚Äôve always visited and stayed at JPark ( then Imperial Palace) and we‚Äôve never had a bad experience.

2.0,"Although this resort is nice with a water park and direct access to the beach, that's about all the positives at the moment. The service is absolutely appaling. Understand that most hotels here in the Philippines are still recovering from covid and the typhoon but you can tell this resort is trying to maximise the occupancy even though they cannot handle the load. 1.5 hours to check in, with many people in the lobby not covid safe at all, then the nightmare gets worse at breakfast time, doesn't matter what time you go, still need to wait over 1 hour surrounded by many other guests, again not covid safe. My personal experience is I travelled from Australia and brought my family here, accommodated 20 adults and 4 kids, if I had of known their business model is to recoup funds on a long weekend I would have saved my money and stayed elsewhere. We would have loved the option to get a cheaper room rate without breakfast. Based on my experience, I would not recommend staying here, especially with a large group of people. Definitely not 4.5/5 star resort.",0.25

Angelica was extra sweet and attentive. Jegger assured me I had the space to work out whatever needed to be done. 
Everyone else had a nod or a smile from time to time.

One my first visit i was not happy and i will not go into that here you can scroll back to see that.

What i will say is this hotel in my eyes greatly improved - front of house was much better this time taking the time to make sure i was looked after and had everything i needed.
Extended me the curtsey of a late check out as my flight was a late departure and were very friendly in all interactions.

I stayed in the club lounge again and it was great and well worth the extra

The selling point of this hotel is the location 2 mins and you are in the Ayala mall where all your needs can be catered for.

The pool area is a little small but adequate and the food here was great

I cant fault this hotel and will always stay here if i need a central location IE Not Mactan Island

Seda Ayala Center, Seda IT Bloc, and Seda Lio, Palawan and ALL Staff Team Members were wonderful. However, regarding the properties, Seda Ayala Center desperately needs a renovation. The decor has not been changed since Marriott owned it in 2011 and you can see the dated decors. The Seda IT Bloc, it's new and nice. The decor is up to date and it does not have that musty smell like Seda Ayala. Seda Lio, it's has lovely grounds but the rooms may need to be updated.

Standard room of good size with qualitative pillows and sheets. Bathroom likewise but has a stinky smell coming out of the toilet corner. A pity for the price you pay.
Shower a bit slippery but hot water works. Aircon is also easy to set up. TV less so with a bit of some getting acquainted with the system as it was set to a channel that is not available.

4.0,"A very popular hotel in Cebu with a good location next to a shopping mall. 
An hour's taxi ride from the airport.

Check-in and reception worked smoothly. The bags came to the room later and the size of the room was just fine. 

The air conditioning was really efficient, even so that it could be turned off all night so that the temperature became suitable. The heating didn't really seem to work. The room is equipped with an empty refrigerator and views of the roof and the adjacent construction site. So not very attractive in that sector. 
The bed deserves a golden brick award because it was super hard and very uncomfortable. Every movement of the person sleeping next to me felt like sailing, but the pillows were perfectly fine. 
Things worked in the bathroom and the shower was efficient and hot water came out. 

The lobby of the hotel was very comfortable and spacious, you could get drinks at a reasonable price from the bar and the pool area was very clean and the sunbeds were spacious. 
From the hotel, it is easy to visit the shopping center next door, where there were really comprehensive shops and dining options. 

One of the best parts of the hotel was definitely the best breakfast in Cebu. It was really wide and sank into the European bloated stomach really smoothly. The food was good and really varied.",0.75

1.0,"After a long day travelling I checked into this hotel specifically requesting a QUIET room (now I realise Filipino's don't do quiet but hey worth asking right?)
They allocated me the exact opposite overlooking the Hotel delivery bay. I rolled with this as sometimes you have to in life but what followed was unforgivable and an egregious fundamental error in hotel management. Jetlagged I was woken up at 12.30 in the morning by the hotel staff cleaning the room next door. I complained the following morning and asked to speak with the Hotel manager who was not available but was told she would be informed and contact me. Nothing.
Miss Dela Cruz apparently has 35 years of hotel management experience behind her and yet does not have the common decency or common courtesy to personally apologise. Madam you are not fit to work in hospitality. I will be taking this up with my credit card company as there has been a breach of contract in terms of what is reasonable to expect from a hotel of your stature. For the record I have stayed in Seda hotels in Makati and Cagayan De Oro with excellent service.",0.0

3.0,"Former Marriott which we have stayed many times before.

Easy access to Ayala Mall thru the back entrance. Amenities included free refillable bottled water, toiletry kits, electronic safe, refrigerator, kettle, coffee and tea. Room was clean and adequate with 2 queen size beds. There was desk and sofa in the room. 

Buffet was ok. We stayed 2 nights. The food choices varied every day. There is an omelet station and noodle station. The hot meals are catered mainly to the Filipino palette which is ok for us. There are cold cuts, a small salad and 3 varieties of fruits limited to pineapple, watermelons and cantaloupes. Surprised not to see mangoes?

Landers is within a 3 minute walk from the hotel.
There is an ongoing road construction currently across the hotel.

Taxi to SM city about php 180. 

The hotel is showing its age. I take one stars off for the towels. Not as bright white as it used to be. Time to be replaced. 

Another star off for a missing perfume from my unlocked carry on bag. (It was a cheap perfume with 1/4 left. Surprisingly, the more expensive sealed perfume in the bag was not taken) First time I lost something in a hotel room from all my local and worldwide travels. It‚Äôs really sad especially this happened in my home country! The moral of the story is - always lock your bags and don‚Äôt leave any valuables lying around!

I haven‚Äôt heard back from Seda management on the results of their investigation and if anything unusual was seen from their security cameras. I requested them to recheck their security cameras if there was somebody else who entered the room. No update as of this writing.

Security is adequate. Need the room access card to take elevator to your room. Staff were friendly and hospitable.",0.5

5.0,"We went for a quick weekend getaway to Cebu last October 6-8, 2023 as a treat of a friend. My Mom and I were booked in a Junior Suite and stayed in room 907. We had the privilege to enjoy their Club Lounge during our stay. 

Comparing my last stay in this hotel way back in 2019, it felt like the hotel has been refreshed. It felt more ""maaliwalas"" and the entire hotel smelled really nice. The lobby, hallway, room, gym, and other facilities are well-maintained. 

However, what makes this hotel stand-out for me is it's SERVICE and its food. 

The breakfast spread at Misto was really something to look forward to. I will always look forward to their hot chocolate (the best I've tasted ever), omelettes, garlic rice, and the dried pusit. All the rest are so good too. The spread at the Club Lounge during Evening Cocktails wasn't too wide, but it is more than enough to fill and satisfy.

Last but definitely not the list, I shall take this time to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to those staff who gave outstanding service.

Erlyn at the Front Desk, though she wasn't the one who checked me in, greeted me with a warm smile and welcomed me back as I was still approaching the desk. It is heartwarming that she still remembered me. She was also very kind when she checked us out.

Paulo, the Bellman who assisted us with our luggage when we arrived, was very helpful and kind. He gave good recos when I asked about nearby establishments. 

The Misto team, particularly Samantha, Sofia, Kenneth, Gade (Kitchen), and Castillano (Security) were all so remarkable. They are an asset. 

Marry of the Club Lounge also left a mark as she delivered impeccable service. She's always smiling and was extremely courteous and charming. 

Our short but meaningful stay in Cebu was made possible by the team. Ms. Gwen, you are doing such a great job with your team and Seda ACC family. Thank you for letting us enjoy our stay. Kudos to you all! ",1.0

She is professional and again, gone out of her way to communicate to the reservation desk in the other hotel that we are going to stay and ask if we could pay the bill upon arrival. 
All in all, me and partner would like to thank Erlyn that she made our stay very very enjoyable and wonderful experience!!!!

3.0,"I stayed for two nights in a room that offered views of Ayala Terraces and the pool area. The hotel lobby features a waiting area where guests can use a complimentary desktop PC for making future bookings. However, our experience was marred by an unpleasant and musty odor emanating from the carpets throughout the entire property. I strongly suggest that they consider either replacing or removing these carpets to enhance the overall quality of the facilities. Despite the age of the building, there is definitely room for improvement.

The hotel's location, adjacent to Ayala Terraces, proves to be convenient for accessing Ayala Mall. Additionally, there is a small pool with a bar; however, the music from the pool bar can be quite disruptive for those who are seeking rest after a long and exhausting flight. It would be advisable for them to take measures to reduce the noise levels.",0.5

2.0,"This was going to be a 4 star review but it‚Äôs the little things that let it down unfortunately.
We had a club room which was fairly average and quite small but clean and functional. Cleaning staff were brilliant and very friendly even leaving nice messages for us.
The club lounge once again is fairly average with a decent breakfast but the shining point was the staff who were super helpful.
At point of booking I asked for a late checkout, now I am a travel agent and know is not guaranteed however I did ask the night before and they said 1 to 130 should be ok but I should check in that morning.
I called 0 twice and lady said she would call me back in 2 mins, she never did!
Finally I went to reception and met a rude member of staff who point blankly told me no!

As a uk travel agent I will not be returning to this hotel nor will I recommend it to my clients or indeed the other 200 members of staff who I work  with Seda

That‚Äôs a fail",0.25

If you are a light sleeper you need to choose another hotel.

Front desk helped organised late check out and airport transfer, both reasonably priced. Location is fantastic, only a  5min walk to Ayala mall and the many restaurant options. Pool was ok, smaller than what we expected. Breakfast buffet was great, lots of options to choose from. Note need to go before 8am to avoid the rush otherwise will need to wait for a table.

4.0,"First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!¬† Smiles and greetings everyday!

We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).

We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.¬† (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the other side since we booked through Agoda.

The room was nicely decorated and the bed comfortable - the pillows were so-so.¬† Linens and towels were nice.¬† The TV channel list was not correct - and missing quite a few channels (I noticed this last year, but no updates were done to the list).¬† I scrolled through all channels, updated the list and provided it to Reception.¬† There was a sewer smell around the toilet in the bathroom - probably a wax seal gone bad over the years - to which we reported during our stay, but declined the offer of maintenance replacing (or moving rooms) as it wasn't too bad - but I confirmed with Reception when we checked out to have maintenance resolve before they put any other guests in the room.

The fridge (what they refer to as a ""chiller"") was warm - even on the coldest setting.¬† I reported it to Reception - they sent up maintenance to check.¬† They tried to tell me that it's only a ""bar fridge chiller"" - but there was no ""mini-bar"" offerings in it  - and since it was not operating correctly (chilling anything less than the room temperature) they replaced it with a proper small fridge since we'd be staying for two weeks and wanted to store drinks and snacks during our stay.¬† Additionally, maintenance also replaced the A/C filter in the room at my request since it looked like it needed changing.

Housekeeping staff (Grace and Mike) were great!¬† We didn't need daily service, but we did get towel replacements and fresh water every day.

We dined daily in the Misto Restaurant for the buffet breakfast.¬† It was nice to see a smiling Sofia (hostess) every morning.¬† Servers Rhea, Ivy and Ryann were very attentive and were friendly every day.¬†
Chef Aldie walked around the restaurant greeting guests and sharing special desserts on several of the mornings.
The food selection was really good - but as is with most buffets in the Philippines... The temperature of the food was warm at best - and some items (hash browns/potatoes at the start of line) were always cold.¬† Lower temps mean more bacterial issues with food.
** Special note for guests - get down there early (before 7:30am especially on the weekends) to get inside seating otherwise you'll be in the overflow area in the lobby or outside on the terrace overlooking the pool.

We got to meet Hayden Kho and his wife Vivian Belo in the lift one morning going down to breakfast.¬† I didn't know who they were when we entered the lift but my fiance was speechless and starstruck at the same time.

The location is perfect being located next to Ayala Center.¬† We visited the Metro Grocery store several times to stock our room fridge.¬† We also dined at Army Navy Burger (awesome ""California Burger"" - just like ""In-Out Burger"" in the USA), Gerry's, Casa Verde, Burger Haus (great German beer on tap) and TGI Fridays).

Pro's
¬†- Staff - by far just awesome!¬†
 - Location - Location - Location¬† 
 - Room was nice and comfortable¬†
 - Morning Buffet selection and Chef Aldie visiting guests tables¬†
 - Security at every entry - and very friendly

Challenges¬†
 - Room fridges/""chillers"" - if they are not working properly and cooling items to at least 4c they need to be replaced as they are inefficient and wasting electricity.¬†
 - TV channel list / channel availability - needs to be updated when changes occur to programming.¬†
 - Morning Buffet food temperature

Will we stay again? - Absolutely! - We really enjoyed staying here for a second time and look forward to returning.

4.0,"As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.

The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled. 

We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and everyone should find something for his taste. Unfortunately, you had to regularly queue and wait until a place has become free. This was not so in previous years, one was then if necessary placed in the lobby, which dan rather reminded of a company canteen. We preferred to have breakfast outside on the terrace. When it rained, however, the water gradually penetrated the ceiling and breakfast was over. It seems that during the renovation a few years ago, the roofs over the terraces were not repaired, one has the feeling that the hotel has saved at the wrong end.

As a conclusion I can say that I will stay again in the hotel, it is still very good standard. However, one has the feeling that as a foreigner married to a Filipina, you have a somewhat heavier stand overall, which you become aware of through many little things, but which can also only be coincidental.

3.0,"The staff  were wonderful and attentive and  the location of the hotel is excellent.  BUT one negative aspect I experienced   and observed is :  NO DRESS  CODE  posted in the dining room.  As a returning guest, I have seen a male hotel guest coming in for breakfast (July 12, 2023 )  wearing sleeveless T-Shirt exposing his hairy  underarms when grabbing for food served during breakfast buffet hours and this compromises sanitation and safety of the food served to  other guest.  Plus, I also saw a hotel guest ( teenager)  today (July 13, 2023) wearing pajamas and having her breakfast.  It appears that it is an extension of her home living room.

3.0,I always stay in Seda when I visit Cebu but this time - December 2022 the place was a bit sad. The parking lot smelled like piss and the walkway towards ayala was not kept clean. The buffet breakfast also had a lot of waiting as they could not accommodate . I suggest you schedule the timings of each floor to help guest plan their time rather than waiting for 30 mins in the lobby to be seated for breakfast.,0.5
4.0,"The check-in was a problem. We had to wait until 3:50 pm. I had to cancel my appointment since I had to shower & change & don‚Äôt have time already. Well, lobby manager tried to explain their problem. I‚Äôm the customer & I have the right to demand what I paid. Well, after thorough dialogue with her, her top manager offered us a discount of our stay so I told everybody to just stay & say what happens. So, we prolonged our stay until even today inspite of calling service that towels were not enough, had to cal more toilet paper & even empty body wash was not replaced. I had to call service twice cuz the net fix our w/c got stuck up for some reasons we don‚Äôt know. Maybe previous occupants throw something there that they should not. This happens every time we come back to stay cuz we chose this as our base where we can meet our relatives & friends before another day of spending our vacay.

- Perfect location. Close to all necessities.
- Adjacent to Ayala Center Mall
- Super friendly and helpful staff
- Buffet breakfast  is great
- Apart from the room charge, they give the option of ""paying as u go"" instead of immediately charging u with the hotel deposit for the restaurant and bar bills. 

CONs:
- The pool area can be updated a bit to make it look in keeping with the modern lobby.
- Some of the sofas in the lobby have ""stains"" on them that make them look unsanitary
- The gym had 3 treadmills but only 1 was working

 Last March 2023, I have a close friend who stayed there for 2 nights and she told me how amazed she was with the room service and all ‚Äî we met at their restaurant and had lunch, their food was incredible . One thing we wouldn‚Äôt forget is how the servers had the initiative to transfer us to a different table since we were seated by the window and the sun was directly shining on us. 

Second, I made a reservation for my bestfriend and she was able to check in early which made her happy despite the long flight she had from Canada ‚Äî the next morning she had a 6am major exam and decided to take it at Misto while having her breakfast, my best friend couldn‚Äôt forget the person who served her ‚Äî Angelica, cause despite her early morning exam, Angelica figured and was kind enough to serve her some coffee and food while she was answering. 

And just last April 20 ‚Äî we celebrated my mom‚Äôs birthday at their restaurant and she really had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the variety of food, everything was so delicious, they even sang a birthday song to my mom and gave her a free cake. Surprisingly, Angelica was there and she helped my mom with her halo halo and was kind enough to take our pictures too. Although we had a last minute miscommunication cause we asked for 3 extra teacups since we ordered Green Tea, the one who assisted us probably misunderstood and thought we wanted 3 more Green Tea (in a teapot) ‚Äî but the cashier, Ivy, was honest and quick to realize we actually didn‚Äôt order more Green Tea but asked for cups and made necessary changes for our bill.

1.0,"This might literally be the worst hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed in for a long long time. Before I continue my dislike of this hotel, I must say that it is located very nicely beside Ayala mall which is a fantastic mall. Also, the staff have been mostly kind and enthusiastic to us. 

However, I cannot write a review based on what could be, but what I experienced. And what I experienced was mostly torture at nights. Am in their hotel bed as I type this, unable to sleep because they have construction going on at 10:30pm outside. Listening to the sounds of hammers and occasional shouting wasn‚Äôt how I envisioned my nights were going to be at Cebu. My wife and I already had to change rooms once because our first room was exposed to very loud live music coming from the mall from Friday to Sundayl. The second room was ok for abit but come the weekday, the construction has been non stop through the day and now into the night (currently 10:35pm)

If you are travelling to Cebu, you might be looking to go on day trips to nearby provinces like Oslob, Bohol, Moalboal etc and most of these day trips will require you to wake up early ~4-5am. The noise will most definitely make it difficult to do so.

I cannot in good faith recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends. And if you do book this hotel, I pray that you are a heavy sleeper/sleep easily or get a room that is away from the noise.

To add on to this, the hotel itself isn‚Äôt fantastic. You could tell that it had its glory days but it is now old and didn‚Äôt keep up with the times. Soap and shampoo etc feel cheap and the walls and mats are old and outdated. 

Again, good staff and location but I will never ever come back here to stay until maybe the construction is finished in a few years.",0.0

Housekeeping needs quality checks. I do not see or hear vacuuming done so guests come in dusty unclean areas. Linens spotted. Stuff shortages as one waits for rooms to be refreshed. For two days now I see one staff responsible for the whole floor of rooms. The only draw here is location as with kids the mall is the destination area and us old folks hate to cross the busy street so we settle for this place.

BUT, the organization is a disaster. This is not a comment on the cleaning/breakfast staff, etc., but management. The gym is big but the ventilation is atrocious - especially because it's located in the basement, without windows. I felt like I was suffocating. The pool was unmanned, even though someone is supposed to tend to it at all times. For the most part we were left to our own devices, which was fine, but it's hard not to feel neglected when it feels like staff is actively avoiding guests.",0.5

Now it has become a cedar and this is the first time we stayed here since the change. Upon checking in it was obvious that they were understaffed. There were only two people in the front desk and it was a long wait before we were checked in. Bill service was also very slow. We were told that our luggage will be brought up right away however after waiting for 15 minutes And after calling for our luggage,my husband had to go down and said he will bring the luggage up himself if they were not going to do it. 

The room itself was decent however the air conditioning was poor. It did not matter what temperature we set the thermostat at it seemed it was stuck at 23 degrees Centigrade.

The lounge service was excellent with a good selection of food and drinks.

Staff who cleaned the room BARGED in to our other room. This was without knocking or ringing the doorbell. He simply felt at home and walked in while I was sitting on the desk working.

The staff are a credit to the hotel, all staff that I interacted with, from the door man to the room cleaners, were 1st class.the room was a very good size, bed was very large and excellent condition. Bathroom and shower was very good and all very clean. Room comes with a fridge and safe. The cleaner will replenish your water supply everyday.

Small bar but a large restaurant, which I used several times. It does take a long while for food and drink to turn up, even when there is nobody else around and several staff. I would have eaten and drank here more if the service was faster. Food was generally very tasty, however, the Sisig was very oily and pork was very crunchy. A shame as that is one of my favourite dishes here in the Philippines.

There is a small pool which was never busy and sun loungers. Again, all clean and tidy. 

I used the gym most days but this is the are of the hotel that is in need of modernising. All equipment is very old, most failing apart in some way and the air conditioning in the gym area was very poor. The air con in the rest of the hotel was excellent so it must be broken in the gym for it to be that hot and stuffy. Not what you want when you want to work out.

At one point I called to verify my car service and after making me spell my name multiple times she told me I did not have car service scheduled. However, when I rushed down to the front desk, I did indeed have car service scheduled.

At breakfast I had to wait an extremely long time for tea, even when it arrived they still had not brought my friends coffee. No one ever refilled the water.

Worst of all they did an internet upgrade and as a result the cable tv service was out the entire next day.

Check out was miserable. I stood in line behind one person for over 10 minutes. Then it took me forever to get checked out because they sort through multiple pieces of paper‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs an antiquated system that is not appropriate for a 12 story hotel.",0.5

The first time i stayed there was no internet.  This second time,  i was given a room with an adjoining room,  divides by one of those creepy doors,  where you don't know its secure. Why in the world you don't know who i am,  my first lousy experience,  then you put me here in this room. The guy next door waa snoring in my ear and his TV blasting all night. The front desk tries hard and work hard,  as do support staff.  I suspect the problem ia management. My CR had no shower glass or curtain divider. That made the shower water cover the entire CR.  What kind of hotel does this to a customer???!! This is just stupid Gwen.!! How would you like to walk around in wet like you're at a swimming pool. It also takes 30 mins to run the water to a warm temperature! The food at the buffet was cold,  not warm,  many dishes were not heated.  This hotel is good for one thing.

5.0,"Stayed at Sea Ayala Center Cebu with my husband just last week and we enjoyed during our stay. Sharing with you pros and cons of the hotel

PROS
*Upon entering the hotel, you will be greeted with their friendly staff. Queenie helped us during check in and granted our request to be at the upper floor for less noise and to have a good view of the city.

*The hotel is modern and the color scheme is refreshing to the eyes. It smelled good too. The sheets were clean and the room looked really nice. It had the usual amenities. 

*Breakfast starts at 6am. The food selection isn't that wide but the food tasted really good. Try their HOT CHOCOLATE. Super sarap! That was the best hot chocolate I tasted in years. 

*Ayala Center Cebu is just beside the hotel. It practically is walking distance. This I enjoyed the most. I shopped and walked back to the hotel. 

CONS
*Room didn't have bathrobes and iron

They quickly moved me to another room, which was great. But if I am paying that much of amount, I expect that this should never happen. 

On the brighter side, their staff were extremely helpful. Breakfast was great. But not enough seating so I had to wait (and other guests too) to be accommodated for the morning buffet.

Your staff needs to learn to verify guests who will be riding the transport service before deploying your service vehicles.

Bathroom was ok in size and clean. Though the hairdryer had fingerprints from the previous occupant if I had to nitpick a negative aspect.

Hours upon arrival, they changed the rate to $100.00 per night since the promo is no longer available. 

again, I don't mind paying $100.00 per night if the service is good. However, management can't even keep up the customer's needs. for exmaple; they  can't even provide a good quality shower soap and we thought it was a good quarantine hotel.

And there is not a conveant store on site. I had to walk off site the buy, drinks, water, and snacks.",0.75
3.0,"Yes Pillows, beddings and towels are bright white and clean which I consider a very important factor in hotel stays.  I also appreciate that room supply of drinking water is not limited.  Housekeeping staff are courteous especially the ladies making up the rooms.  

Breakfast buffet is great, but they never served danggit for our entire  5-day stay.  We expected that.  

The only thing that disappointed us is when my daughter had diarrhea, their clinic charged us PhP20 each for every diatabs tablet.  Emergency medicines like those should be provided free.  And there is no direct line to their clinic.  That is critical for emergency situations/sicknesses.  And calling tru the room telephone line to the operator/reception or housekeeping is so so hard because there‚Äôs no dial tone most of the time.  You have to patiently wait for a dial tone. I hope Waterfront address this ASAP.  In emergeny cases, hotel guests are left helpless.",0.5

That being said we did have some problems duri ng our 18 night stay..The hotel had no hot water for 4 FULL DAYS..They had a major mechanical issue.....But honestly what upset me more was heading to the pool for a nice cool down at the end of the day,We arrived at the pool at 8:30 p.m. the pool hours are 7am to 9 pm..Only to be told that they were no longer admitting guests..They really didnt give a good reason why...And when I questioned the management they just shruged it off .....THE HOT WATER ISSUE WAS OUT OF YOUR CONTROL..  THE POOL HOURS ARE TOTALLY IN YOUR CONTROL....AND ITS FOR THAT REASON I GAVE YOUR HOTEL 3 STARS...We will be finding a different hotel on our next visit to the Phillipines..",0.5

4.0,"I wonder how this large property will make it's way back?It's a nice enough place to stay but it has frayed at the edges. No faulting the staff which do their best under the conditions, even the Registration desk which is really understaffed. My most unforgivable item is the poor internet. The impact on this across the whole user population has to have a damaging effect. The hotel offers varied and huge spaces, but they are more representative, I think, of an earlier era that was driven by conventions etc. They are more less diminished from the rise and dominance of the internet... there is something very short-sighted at the upper management/owner level, except that they have a huge amount of property that will probably come to market someday in Cebu... Until then, enjoy your time there, but don't expect to do much online work unless you take up residence in the lobby which seems to have better internet. Pity, I won't be back - there are too many other properties to try in Cebu.",0.75

When we first made our reservation the staff took us back and forth two rooms as he didn't how to deal with the discount offer our school gave us. When he finally sat us down to take the reservation, he kept going back and forth to his superior every question we asked him. Going back to checking in, the receptionist upstairs the line at least took 30-40 minutes. Yet still, the receptionist told us to wait another 30 to 40 minutes as our room was not yet ready. The hotel and staff we're completely unprepared despite knowing that there will at least be a 1000 students having attending grad ball on that day. Many of which, checked in the hotel, having no updated list of who paid and did not. Which led to a singular person taking an hour to check-in. The rooms were outdated, I was not in one of renovated rooms. The air-conditioning was slow despite being set to its highest settings. It has the old rattan furniture. There were barely any outlets and one outlet couldn't even charge a phone. The wifi was also slow or uncooperative.",0.0

4.0,"Stayed at this hotel for 3 weeks, a grand old lady of a hotel. Room was dated but veey functional, bed comfortable, shower hot and AC kept the room cool. The fridge did like to grind away and clunk on a regular basis. Pool area a nice place to relax, it is in need of some work and a clean around the side of the pool. Should be closed for a few days to bring back the shine to it. Reception area and lounge area a pleasant place to sit and work while watching the world go past. The women who serve and take orders all wonderful and polite, I could not fault any of the hotel team. Now my own big moan and I did give this feedback! Staying for over 20 nights the problem got worse! The problem being lack of sprites available! Jack Daniels ran out after 2 nights! Never seen again, JB one night longer never seen again Jonny Walker Black a few more days! Then the run started to run down to limited options. I have to say this is very poor and I complained so I am only repeating what I said at the hotel. The hotel needs to have a meaningful stock replenishment process. If I had been a normal guest looking for drinks and a meal I would have gone out after the drinks started to run dry and spent my money elsewhere in the evening.a great pity and the only reason I would not give the hotel a 5. Hope to return again in August for a couple of weeks for work again. Let's see if this has improved!",0.75

4.0,"Our stay at the Waterfront Hotel in Cebu was a very pleasant one. All the staff were very friendly and could help with any request we asked them. Their service was outstanding. 
For our hotel room, overall it was good. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on and the room contained everything we needed for our 1 week stay. One disappointment was the shower and toilet as they did not work very well. But I will say that when the toilet at one time was not working they sent a plumber immediately to fix it which was good.
The Waterfront Hotel architecturally is a marvel. We enjoyed going for walks around the outside of the building and inside the building and observing the huge art works on the walls and ceiling. What was also great was the restaurant and cafe options on the Lobby level of the hotel. We particularly liked the food and service at the La Gondola restaurant.
We also appreciated the hotel's pick up service. At our request the Waterfront Hotel organized for a driver to come to meet us when we arrived at Mactan-Cebu airport to drive us straight to the hotel which certainly was a great help for first time visitors to Cebu like us!
We also appreciated their bus shuttle service which took us to the Ayala Mall and back to the hotel. Also there were always taxis available to take us anywhere we wanted to go around Cebu.
Overall, the Waterfront Hotel made our stay in Cebu a comfortable and memorable experience.",0.75
3.0,"The hotel is ok but could really do with some improvements. It is an old hotel and the rooms are generally worn. The window was very dirty and one of the lights was in poor condition. There was also no bidet or brush for the toilet. 

 For the 14 nights I stayed, there was no soap in the male swimming pool toilets. The toilets were also in a generally poor condition, and it felt like they were just neglected.

I found the staff generally good. The cleaning staff was excellent. Security were polite and numerous. It felt very safe. Breakfast was excellent. As you are not allowed to use the stairs, it can be ridiculous trying to get back to your room when there are big events going on. I had to wait over 45 mins one evening just to return to my room. 

Overall, I would not say this was a terrible hotel, though I do believe it is overpriced relative to other chealer hotels I stayed in the area. I can believe it used to be once great, but it feels like it has been left behind to rot. With investment and a heavy focus on modernization, this hotel has the potential to be great.",0.5
4.0,"Cebu waterfront hotel is a large and elegant hotel in Cebu city (not near the waterfront).  I stayed in an ambassador suite.  It was large and comfortable with a nice living area with a half bath, and a separate bedroom with a full bath.   Everything worked well in the room.  
You are greeted by staff outside the hotel, and the lobby doors are opened for you and you are greeted again by young women in long red dresses in the lobby. 
There are restaurants, conference rooms, a gym and a large pool and garden area.  The pool area looked to be showing its age but it was still attractive. 
Staff were courteous and helpful.  My only problem or complaint is that there were a number of conventions or conferences going on so it was very busy.  The line for the free breakfast was long and there was only one person checking people in for breakfast and it was taking a minute or two for each guest. They needed to get more help at that point. We had to skip breakfast and that was a little annoying.",0.75

1.0,"My daughter, who is based in the United States, booked a hotel room for us. I provided her with my credit card details as I did not have a computer to book the room. When she attempted to complete the payment, the site notified her that ""Payment was not authorized"". Those EXACT words. There was no confirmation number. She subsequently tried again assuming that it could be an error. And again it stated that payment was not authorized. Because of the urgent need for a room, she ended up using her own credit card to book a room for us and this transaction went through. 

Upon arriving to the hotel, we were mortified to find out that we were charged 3 TIMES!! How completely misleading and fraudulent. After explaining the situation to the front desk, we ended up booking a second night and using two of the 3 charges for 2 nights. But we EXPLICITLY said that the third charge must be refunded. We only received ONE CONFIRMATION page, and we even gave in by booking a second night so we didn't have to argue about getting two refunds. We were told that my daughter needed to submit an email request (they provided a specific email), and then the refund could be issued. That email was sent on November 17, and to date, WE HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A RESPONSE. 

Waterfront Management, you should be ashamed. First, you allowed for this malfunction to create duplicate charges on your website. If a page says payment NOT authorized, customers will obviously assume a payment didn't go through. You should have immediately corrected this issue upon arrival. And not only did you not correct his, you completely IGNORED a customer email that required your action.

The housekeeping staff are all such friendly people and it doesn't matter where you go, you are always welcomed with a big beautiful smile. 

I have provided this travelling tip before - book the ambassador rooms which gives you access to the ambassador lounge for the full VIP privileges - it actually doesn't cost that much extra! 4

Located on the top floor with panoramic views back over the city to Mactan Island this is the perfect way to relax and unwind - and as a bonus they provide free happy hour from 5pm - 7pm inclusive of free drinks (yes including alcohol) and snacks. Having been a frequent visitor to this lounge I have had the privilege of being looked after by past butlers Wilden, Mike and Aubrey, who all of whom no longer work in the lounge due to well deserved promotions and still connected to the hotel.

The new butlers Joseph , Chel and Arnold are just as equally professional, friendly, well mannered and very accommodating. I cannot wait to check in tomorrow and see the team again. Truly a great team who cannot do enough for you.

The conference team and facilities are first class with all types of rooms for small groups up to the grand ball room 5,000 people. All needs are catered for and I have attended some amazing events which take your breath away. A special thank to Miss Sophia who arranges my teams conference with such short notice and professionalism.

Finally, the hotel itself has a vast array of restaurants to choose from including buffet (Uno), Italian (la gongola my favourite), Chinese (Tin Gow) and Japanese (Mizu). The pool area is amazing with a large pool and decorative waterfall. The gym and sauna are also world class. The location is perfect, right in the heart of Cebu City and across the road from the IT park and 5 min walk to Ayala Mall.

Not that it‚Äôs a big amount, but the gym manager insisted on charging after she learnt that we are part of the team of competitors.  She even turned the table around and said that we were dishonest! What‚Äôs so dishonest about being hotel guests? And does being a competitor meant being discriminated against ?

The room was just ok. The bed wasn‚Äôt very comfortable, but ok. 
The bathroom appliances were old and my shower pull bottom from switching from bath tub mode to shower mode was stuck so I only got have the water shower. I didn‚Äôt bother asking for new room or getting this fixed. I made due. 
Casino was boring. Lots of slots machines, some card tables, but nothing exciting going on there, so just spent an hour, blew some pesos on roulette and slots and called it a night. Had more hope for that.

Me and my arab boyfriend was upset by the time we enter the main entrance of the hotel.  There is one security guard name Gonzales who went us and talk very rudely. Instead of welcoming us and explain about  the rules here. Because we are using a big motorbike here in Cebu but it‚Äôs very shame the way he talked to us is not acceptable as a guest . Me and my boyfriend felt uncomfortable that time. And was shocked ! We are not homeless he should not talk like that and he‚Äôs behavior is funny. He don‚Äôt even talk to us nicely and calmly. And there‚Äôs one more funny thing about that security, we asked him to give a few minutes to enter the reception for our reservation before we park our motorbike because we are in a rush time . So after that we were at the reception talking to the 2 ladies . And I don‚Äôt understand they are struggle to attain the guest  one lady talking the phone and the other one making herself busy instead of assisting us first and explain about the rooms and the procedure we deny feel they welcoming us . No smile at all even they are wearing a mask we can see if they are smiling or not . So we spend an hour to request our reservation that time. And so ridiculous that security came to us while we are sitting in the lobby with my boyfriend. Because we discuss about our plans for that day. And the security suddenly came to us and keep telling us that we need to park the motorbike . Very annoying !! Common . The management of the hotel pls take action for this ! I don‚Äôt want to feel that to any of ur guest !  We don‚Äôt even complain the room that they gave  us. Very old and not so clean as what we expect . We found a dusty ..until we checkout that hotel one more security is very annoying ! We asked him to find a taxi for us because we are so late for our flight . But he told to us to wait. But he‚Äôs gesture was so bad . They are not doin their job . They act like they are the boss haha lol üòÇ   .. and the funny is I can understand their dialect . They don‚Äôt talk to my boyfriend I don‚Äôt know why they struggle to explain to him in English . They let me explain ito my boyfriend. For what?  Talked to him !!! Anyhow  We just enjoy the breakfast buffet . The service staff and the manager was so nice at the restaurant  They treat us vip and we appreciate.  We will never come back for sure ! The pool is very poor . The ambience very poor .",0.0

The rooms are clean but dark and tired, the casino was almost empty when I looked in, no draft beer in the bar just expensive bottled beer. Good margaritas though.

If that was the test of me keeping my job, i would have lost it. The only bright side for me is that their breakfast was great! Plus it‚Äôs not difficult to get a cab/taxi.

Here are our Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Stay with Waterfront Cebu City Hotel and Casino, Cebu, Philippines!",1.0
2.0,"I have been a regular guest at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City & Casino for the every year for the past 15 years except 2020-2021 due to covid.
Frankly, I see a decline in service and facilities and there is little or no action to address this.
At breakfast I requested more milk for cereal as the milk carafe was empty. To my surprise the waiter returned with a 2-litre carton of unchilled milk. After explaining to him that cereals are always served with chilled milk he returned with chilled milk. But next day same thing. The milk in the carafe was not chilled and the container it was in had no ice to keep it chilled. Once again, I asked for chilled milk and it was replaced. I later saw a manager pointing out that chilled milk is standard provision for cereals and all hotels follow that just as Waterfront has always done in my previous stays there, including my stay at Waterfront Cebu City in May this year.
The manager totally agreed. Next day on entering the restaurant for breakfast a waiter approached me and said you want chilled milk sir? No I said, not just me, everyone expects chilled milk for cereals. I pointed out juices are provided there chilled in dispensers.  Milk should also be provided chilled for cereals and simply just for drinking a glass of milk.
Two days later it happened again - unchilled milk. After leaving the restaurant, I asked to speak to manager, a different one this time. This manager also agreed and same thing again followed next day. A waiter asked if I want chilled milk.  
The two managers were simply identifying the issue as a special request by a particular guest. No.  It is not a special request. Providing chilled milk is a standard requirement for all guests and up till now Waterfront has always automatically done that without being asked during my many stays there, as it should.
Suggestion: Get a cold liquid dispenser for milk just like the 4 chilled juice dispensers that are there in the breakfast restaurant.
When we went down to lower lobby we immediately noticed a bad odour in the corridors like the smell from a rubbish tip. It became clear, that this was not just our imagination, when I saw a small air purifier turned on at a power point in the corridor. But clearly this little purifier was not enough to dispel this odour which was also  outside in the garden and pool area which is critically in need of redevelopment.  Alarmingly, there are no proper change/shower/toilet facilities in the pool area and this was the case well before covid 19. The previous male facility for the pool which had showers, lockers and toilets has been closed for many years. I was told the nearest male facility was in the gym back inside the hotel, quite a distance from the pool. Totally unsatisfactory. You don‚Äôt want to walk inside the hotel wet after using pool. And what are they doing about it? Nothing. Still in the too-hard basket.
The previously provided shade umbrellas have gone. Not one umbrella there. Ground drainage channels need upgrade- algae should not be visible. The rock looks like it has passed its use-by date. Pull at down and redevelop the area providing proper change room facilities.
I reported the odour issue in the lower lobby to a manager. The manager agreed there was a bad odour there but days later no change, odour still there with the one small air purifier working.
I get the feeling, Waterfront has been aware of this odour problem for some time but has taken no proper action to address the issue. I might add this odour problem was not there when we stayed in the hotel earlier this year in May.
What needs to be done? Provide more air purifiers? No. No. No. Track down the source of the smell and contain or remove it.
Waterfront managers just agreeing with guests of an existing issue is not enough. Action to fix it is what is required.",0.25

4.0,"I've been staying at the Waterfront Hotel every few years since 2008. It used to be the go to luxury hotel in Cebu City, and I loved everything that the hotel had to offer.
However the hotel has as of recently dropped below its 5 star standards. Customer service is second to none as always, and it's a reason that I still remain a loyal customer.
Some points to consider;
‚ñ™Ô∏èThe room bathrooms now show visible mould
‚ñ™Ô∏èBasin tap was leaking
‚ñ™Ô∏èCarpets are very worn out
‚ñ™Ô∏èRooms appear very dusty in hard to reach areas
‚ñ™Ô∏èRoom walls have discoloured.

The lobby is a great part of the hotel, I would bring guests here to drink almost every night, an excellent part of the hotel offering.
The breakfast buffet was brilliant as always with a huge selection of international and local dishes.

In conclusion, the hotel does seem to have aged considerably, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but may put into question its 5 star status.",0.75

The staff and the service crew on the day of our event were also very polite and attentive to our concerns and instructions. The food for our snacks at the venue were also good according to our guests. If you have time, please also try their buffet lunch or dinner at Cafe Uno near the main lobby. You‚Äôd be amazed by the visual presentation and the mouth-watering flavors of their dishes. We‚Äôll definitely come back at the Waterfront Hotel for more events. It‚Äôs a 10/10 experience.

Let‚Äôs just say the toilet looked like a public toilet, the ones you see in ratchet clubs at 4 in the morning, if you know what I mean. The food at the reception was horrid!!!! The food looked like it was food for the pigs!! The servers were the ones plating the food, the plates were so full of food that the sauces were mixing, the salad was mixed with the chicken and rice, the lumpia tasted like kaldereta.

just attended the wedding of my dear friend yesterday and the buffet is so dissapointing.  The way they serve the food is like food for beggars. You are not allowed to chose.

Same goes with the drinks. no second drink allowed. one of my friends did not ask for his plate as we shared. the mother of the groom ask for her food and been told that if she want we need to pay additional for another person as all the plates has been serve.

After all taking a family of 3 adults and child to a nice place,  can run as much, if not more, after ordering main, sides, dessert, ice tea and cofffee etc etc .. adds up..
AS ALWAYS the staff is outstanding, everyone in every position. Welcome home was the feeling we got, and that makes for a special ambience all in itself.

The hotel had zero hot water in the whole building and other guests said it had been like this for days.  Any hotel can have issues, but this going on so long gives an insight to how bad it is.

Air conditioning doesn't cool properly
Wifi is slow 
Tiny old TV in the rooms

Good thing only that they allowed us to check in early and check out late as well. However, the pool was disappointing. The small slide is off limits and there were broken tiles in the kids pool, which I unfortunately saw only when my son hurt his feet (there was no notice/warning whatsoever).

2.5,"Room was not superbly clean: the couch and ottoman chair were dirty with stains. Some dust accumulation on the corners, behind the curtains. The door jamb was rotting at the bottom, hinges were rusted. Tiles were a bit dirty.

The elevator from the basement was quite rundown.

At 9am someone rang our doorbell 3x just to ask if we needed anything from them. I found that to be a nuisance rather than helpful. 

At 10:20am we got a call asking if we wanted to extend our stay and reminded us of the 11am check out. This made us feel they were in a hurry to get us out of the hotel.

Mind you, their check in time is late at 3pm and check out is quite early at 11am. That gives them 4 hours of cleaning time yet the room was not clean enough to the standard we were expecting.

The staff were all very courteous though.

But because our overall experience was not satisfactory, we will not be visiting again in the near future nor recommend them to friends or family.",0.16666666666666663

3.0,"FACILiTIES - The only ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù you can do is the pool at the 21st floor. It is a safe option when you have a kid who knows how to swim but not yet that skillfull. Downside cannot use it when it rain and there‚Äôs lightning. Not Happy that we were not allowed to bring the pool towel to our room, imagine a shivering kid.
CHECK In/Check Out- It is not my firsttime but the staff at check in seemed lost. My voucher says it is already paid and was asked for payment again bec. They said that the payment was not reflected. I insisted  to the extent of showing confirmation that my cc was charged. It took awhile for it resolved. Check out was not hassle free made wait for 10mins.  
ROOM- Hotel is small, rooms smaller, small bathroom that you need to go to the other side ,close the door so you can reach the shower area, no iron &board in the room. Broken hair dryer, we had to switch rooms bec the first we had didn‚Äôt have any electricity.
Food- great selection ranges 1-1500 pesos
Accessibility- the hotel is near parkmall, Sm city and other resto but You NEEd car as it is not a safe area too many snatchers/hold upers. Taxi is an option which the hotel can get it for you. 
LOCATION- good when you need a place to stay coming or going to cebu port.

3.8,"I do not have a good experience in Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu. First and foremost, the staff wrote Mr before my name. And they know for sure all Maria in the Phils are females. Besides, i gave my PRC card at the check in counter and for sure Mr Erickson saw me female in flesh. But why, in the big screen I am MR. MARIA PRESA APARIS (pics attached). 2. Mr. Erickson at the check in counter said, the extra bed will be set up later. I said no worries because we will not sleep yet but will take a dip in the pool. Sad to say, we came back to the room after 4 hours and my bed is not fix yet. I still have to call and  follow it up. We are 3 in the room but only given 1 shampoo, 1 lotion, 1 liquid soap, no face towel and only 1 hand towel. Mr Erickson at the front desk said the high tea will be at 4:30-5:30pm at the mezzanine floor. But when we reach Mezzanine at 4:30pm women at the front said it starts 2:30pm-4:30pm. Why is it your crew does not have a consistent answer. When I heard those 2 answers inconsistencies i was like "" so this means i will be eating leafovers"".Worst because the suppose Mezzanine lounge was close and we are transferred to have the high tea at the view lounge.Mr. Paul at the view lounge said that the mezzanine was close because only a few of the residents will have high tea. And what frustrates me is the very long waiting time for the suppose high tea. I said suppose high tea because what was served is not a high tea set up.The suppose unlimited cocktail is also set in the view lounge. And upon check in, Mr Erickson said that in the  unlimited cocktail lots of food will be serve as well that you wont crave for dinner. With this being said, my expectations were so high most especially that I just came from Pearl Farm Resort in Davao and I know Dusit is at par with Pearl and the service there were so great. So sad to say, my expectations perilously drop when after more than 3 hours of waiting our food is not serve.The beach time is set until 5pm and they only have 2 umbrellas with no shades at all to hide under the scorching heat of the sun.Together with me is a senior citizen and sad to say its not elderly friendly area.The pool towels are old yet the incharge does not allow me to bring it to our room. I got angry and said, ""you want me to go up to my room wet and water dripping in the elevator floor? "" He replied, because we still need to wash that one Mam"". what a reason. In Pearl Farm, their towels are new, and very soft. Yet after using I asked, where will I place this? the crew answered, just place it there Mam and we will be the one to get it. I am making this review for them to improve their service. More so to have a good review and encourage more people to come or be back to the place. It is so sad to note that they have a instagrammable view but the service does not reach to our expectation. Credit to Jomar at the view lounge who really did his best to please us. The breakfast though is so good and they sang happy birthday to my uncle. Big thanks.",0.6

Buffet breakfast offered many choices including cook to order omelettes, congee, fruit juice, and coffee selections.

Location - while I may prefer to stay in hotels that are adjacent to malls, I could not complain about this hotel‚Äôs location in the middle of Mandaue. Parking is easy and since you drive inside the hotel compound to get out of the car, I felt very safe. It was easy to get transportation via Grab at the time of my stay.

The people really made it special for us and always made sure our kids (4 and 6 years old) had a great time. Really above and beyond. As is typical for resorts, the property is an island of luxury amidst the bustle of a city, but it was easy to get around as needed.

The Chinese restaurant was also very good.  The pool, water park and ocean beach area was maintained well and clean.  The beach bar had good drinks.  The casino which is connected but not part of hotel was disappointing and not very welcoming.  The majority of the customers seem to be Korean and it was difficult chatting with other guests. 
The suite was well appointed and had 1.5 baths to help with kids. The only strange thing was the lack of Filipino style toilet facilities, no hose or bucket.  I noticed, as with other hotels, a lack of towels in the room.  It is necessary to call for towels especially if you shower before dinner and in the morning.

1.0,"The first thing I noticed was the negative vibes at the reception during check in. This Sheryl or Sherry who is a supervisor according to her name tag couldn't maintain her customer service attitude to save her life. This girl was condescending AF. She kept interrupting me, spoke so fast and kept giving abrupt answers. She had a funny look on her face when I told her I don't have a credit card when she ask for a cc to charge a deposit. I gave her my debit card and she declined it in a condescending way then proceeded to tell me I can use cash. this B could have offered that as an option in the first place. Also, she has this funny look when she gave me my key. I should've known there was something wrong with thr room. I found a leaf on the dresser?! it seems they only do light cleaning. the baby keeps sneezing as the room seems a bit dusty. the air-conditioning was worse than a fan as it couldn't keep the room cool and it keeps making noises. We tried calling the service center and we were on indefinite wait until the line drops. we kept calling till we gave up and resumed in the morning. we finally got someone when we tried calling housekeeping line and the promised to send us someone. we waited for more than an hour for that person to arrive then confirm that the AC is busted and we had to transfer rooms. which was totally useless as we had somewhere to go and had to check out early. the hotel refused to compensate for this because its an online booking. also there was a ball and a lot of people was there to party which caused traffic in the elevators. they had 2 areas with 4 elevators and only 3 out 4 elevators are functioning. we asked if we could take the stairs going to the 3rd floor, they don't have it.

 The breakfast and the hotel decor was nice & clean, The initial room had a bad odor and we requested a different room. Our request was honored. Also, It  is my understanding that on your initial entry into your room at a three to five star hotel a staff person will escort you to your room along with your luggage and provide a brief introduction to the room pointing out the various amenities and qualities of said room. An opportunity for the hotel to feature their reason why their hotel is worthy of their status. An opportunity to ""BRAG"" about their hotel. This hotel provided none of these qualities of  behavior in this regard.  However after the initial failures , the following stay at this hotel was professional, exemplary, helpful, and all around wonderful. From the cleaning ladies/staff to the front desk, to the entire breakfast crew,  the door men, to security. They were all exceptional. Using a baseball metaphor: ""They knocked it out of the park"".  I would recommend this hotel to all of my acquaintances & friends. However not my enemies. This hotel is much too good for stupidity. Respectfully

 Breakfast was awesome!
 The description on the App did not match what the Hotel offered. I have paid an additional 800 pesos for an ""upgrade"" as offered in the App and after the upgrade, it stated that I will have a ""double room"". When I checked in, the staff explained that the upgrade was for a higher floor and complete facilities. I was thankful to the staff who clarified the issue but I am disappointed in the App for it is misleading. I initially paid an extra because I was expecting to get a better room, a bigger space, not a higher floor with more complete facilities.",0.8888888888888888

 The Bai Hotel was beautiful and the food we had was excellent. We ate twice at the rooftop pool area, once in the evening and once in the afternoon, and both were great experiences, with delicious food in a beautiful environment with an amazing 360 view of Cebu. It is very convenient to have late-night dining options at the hotel. The rooms are well designed with a contemporary and fresh look, and the lobby of the hotel provides an extremely impressive first impression. I stayed at another quality hotel in Cebu previously at about the same price, but the Bai was much nicer and we will stay there again on our next visit.
 The only negative about the Bai is that the location is not central to many shopping and restaurant options within walking distance, but there are plenty of options only a short cab ride away.",1.0

 I checked into this hotel today and the air conditioning in the room was broken. It was below 20 degrees the whole time. I waited there for 3.5 hours from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and it couldn't be repaired and I couldn't get an equivalent room. I was offered a much smaller room and I wanted the price difference, but was also rejected. I didn't get a refund for the room either and so I checked out of the hotel. I didn't use anything in the room I booked and just waited there. It was zero service. Never again.

 The true value of this property is in it‚Äôs amazing staff..  from the security staff, to the concierge.. to the servers, the cleaners, everyone has a smile on their face, everyone makes you feel absolutely welcome..  I have never been treated so good at any resort in the world. I almost don‚Äôt like to single to staff members out because they are also incredible. But Vince and Venus went above and beyond, even though they are on a team of complete Rockstars. I appreciate both of them very much.
 The only thing I did not like about the property was with pillows, many of these hotels are moving towards these type of pillows that feel like they have air in them.. they are soft to the touch, but in my opinion, difficult to sleep on. My neck sore for 24 hours. I called to see if they had some different type of pillows. Housekeeping immediately requested to come and change them all, but I asked them if they are different or the same. And they told me all pillows are the same. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal for most people, but I can tell you that my jacket wrapped up in a towel was more comfortable than these pillows. Management needs to change them immediately. I would‚Äôve continued to stay at this hotel if it was not for this. I will come back, but only because of the staff. I will obviously have to bring my own pillow.",0.7777777777777777

 Our stay in this hotel serves as our 1st honeymoon with my husband, and since this was the 1st day we meet again because both of us are working abroad, we were looking for a really nice hotel. I have a lot of friends in cebu and most of them recommended Bai hotel. And indeed, we had a really amazing and great time staying in this hotel. We were so lucky that the receptionist gave us an upgrade of the room from deluxe twin room to a king sized bedroom! We were so happy and excited. The room was really elegant and big with a beautiful city view at night. The breakfast buffet was magnificent. We all like the menu served and the time they gave from 6am to 10am is very nice specially for us who don't like to wake up early for the free breakfast. The swimming pool experience was also great and romantic. All of the staff we encountered were very polite, helpful and approachable. All in all, the experience we had was really amazing üíØ. Surely we will stay again in this hotel once we get back to cebu. Highly recommended üëç

 The rooftop Twilight bar. Oppressive heat and no fans, the barstools were uncomfortable for me being a large foreigner, and the rush to order drinks forced me to ask for a suggestion. I was told the Mai Tai is ""salable."" It was overwhelmingly bitter and was not my kind of drink. I instantly regretted it and wish I had been given more time to order. I stood almost the entire time and didn't take but a few sips. Once I was covered in sweat, we just paid the bill and left. Probably won't visit it again if we return.

the hotel near to a small shopping mall that full of restaurants..

The checking in and out process took long time..
Receipt only available after request..
Room condition need lots of improvements, wall cushion got mould /water stains, floor full with scratches, dusty chair, door got mould stain, toilet wall got red colour stains and old & broken tissue box.
The initial room given has aircon condensation issue which leads to serious water dripping issue at bathroom.
Requested for room change but the whole process was length and not being handled well.
Going up n down the floors several times due to the replacement room key lock malfunction issue, even the manager's universal key also unable to unlock the door.

 Highly likely that it was my fault, but my booking did not include breakfast. The one thing that did bother me was that a discount voucher was offered to my cousins who were booking at the same time as I was but not to me. There needs to be a consistent and standard approach to this.
 The halls smelled a bit weird to me. I've been to hotels that smelled better. My room also smelled a bit moldy but I didn't see any mold whatsoever.

Also, what is up with the metal detectors?! It was such a hassle going in and out of the hotel! I understand safety but a hotel having metal detectors is more concerning to me than a hotel that doesn't have metal detectors.",0.7777777777777777

Great location for most places in Cebu
 - Hotel baggage staff moved my belongings into secret room, which I had to go into to get another credit card, and then found one of the staff going through my bags!
- Hotel has gone down hill (as with all hotels in Cebu area sadly) as foreign tourists are still very scarce.
- Too overcrowded with local guests taking up the rooms (amazed to see how the locals can afford to stay there the same as me)
- With near full occupancy you have to wait several minutes before a lift is ready to move you between floors
- Breakfast time in the restaurant is extremely noisy and very long queues to wait for mainly local focused cuisine (not nice food)
- Room was in poor state, dirty floors, dirty windows with bird excrement and had not been cleaned for a long time
- Difficult to call reception at times
- Check-in is a long battle (though the staff are friendly), it takes them a very long time to program their computer and a lot of paperwork to have to read and sign before you can get your keys
- No Express Check-in or Check-out facility
- Deposit in cash required, or if taken by card can take two months to be credited back
- No hotel liability if room safe is stolen or things in the room go missing (you have to sign a waiver on arrival)
- Entering hotel is slow, as security guard outside does a ceremony walk around car with angled mirror, but doesn't actually look at the mirror.  All bags are screened like airport security, just takes time with lots of bags.
- Chairs in room make it difficult to walk around the entire bed.
- Shower floor has moving grip tape
- Photos look nothing like the actual room
- Room cleaners knock often to check to clean the room
- Water feature in square outside not working (or not switched on)
- Main foyer downstairs over crowded (seemed like a wedding was taking place there)
- Bedroom lights confusing to operate - two glaringly bright lights over the bed
- Bathroom sink plug was closed and difficult to open
- Toilet seat at an angle
- Small rooms",0.1111111111111111

 Amazing service & staff. Comfortable rooms. Breakfast was HUGE buffet, everyone will definitely find something to eat. Hotel also has a small rooftop pool and 4 restaurants in case you want to have staycation like we did on our last night (pretty close to Cebu Int Airport).Tried also their gym and was offering enough equipments and free weights in its small zone.
 We would have wished that the reception told us about ‚Äôdress code‚Äô on the breakfast; men are not allowed in the restaurant in sleevless shirts. We didn‚Äôt mind the dress code but informing before waiting ages the ‚Äôtraffic hour‚Äô elevator to go back to 17th floor and back to 2nd was frustrating. However, the stafd apologised that this was not told us upon check-in, and otherwise all was close to perfect.",0.8888888888888888

 The hotel is modern clean and comfortable. The roof offers great views over the city and access to two pools! The room was spacious and very comfortable. The proximity to the airport is helpful too and was the main reason I booked a night here.
 The only negative thing was that when I enquired about organising a transfer to the airport the concierge quoted me 1400 pesos for what would have been a 20 minute journey. I politely declined as this was far too much. He then reduced the amount to 900. I ended up booking a taxi with Grab and it cost me less than 300 pesos.",0.7777777777777777

And I had a minor issue upon checking in, reception desk told me I only booked for 1 room on their system but I actually booked for 2 rooms (1 bed); showed them my booking.com account booking that reflected the 2 rooms booked prior. It was resolved but they ended up giving me 2-bed rooms instead of my original booking of 1 bed room. 

Breakfast time‚Äî staff told me I only paid for lesser people (when in my booking, I actually paid for 4 people *2 free breakfast/room*); again I argued and insisted my booking. Was resolved.

 The staff were rude. I booked two double rooms but upon arrival I was told they only had rooms with twin beds, I informed them that I had paid for two double rooms but was told that the rooms were allocated on whom made the earliest booking. I disagreed with this and showed my booking was made for two double rooms and to be fair (albeit there was a suggestion I was lying about my booking even when providing evidence) I was upgraded but had one double room and one twin room. The next problem arose when checking out, I was charged for cleaning of a towel as it (as described by the staff on reception) had a small blood stain on it, I was asked how and why it had happened and as it was my partners sister who was staying in the room I had no clue why there was a blood stain. After asking my partners sister what had happened I was informed she had started her menstruation and hadn't realised. The staff showed no empathy and after staying in many hotels over the years this is the first time I have ever had to pay for anything like this. The staff made my partners sister feel very embarrassed and honestly, although the hotel itself was nice, the staff were horrible.",0.0

 Our first time to try the breakfast buffet and we all enjoyed it. Room size was good enough. I did not expect that the 2 small beds, were not really that small. It could actually fit 2 persons. There is an ATM inside & outside the hotel. Although me and my son opted to stay in the hotel instead of our condo, we got the chance to have the view of it and the sea view. Front office staff were very helpful. They said they have upgraded us to a king bed but we did not want it and told them to stick to 2 single beds request and with connecting rooms or at least, with rooms close to each other.
 I got 3 rooms for my family and the room that I was in, if I don't close the toilet bowl cover toilet splashes when flushed. Check out is at 11am. Thankfully, before I left (since I was travelling), I went to front desk and ask for and extension until 1pm since we checked in very late afternoon.

 The staff are amazing, very professional and well trained. Random encounters like sharing an elevator they'll greet you and ask about your stay. I am not a king, but felt like one for a few days. Breakfast is luxurious, and Bai cafe counter layout made access to all those delicacies easier with the competitive guests. We booked two rooms for our family, and the on duty manager put us in neighboring room with side-door which was convenient. The rooftop pool is is pretty impressive, not deep enough for diving, but possible to do lane swimming, and great to laze under the cover and enjoy a mighty fine cheeseburger or pizza. Location is nice and close to Park Mall.
 One night, I needed to call operator or reception, and both didn't answer or call back.  (I suppose they were very busy, but a call-back would have been nice). Upon check-in arrival, we were dropped off by a taxi at the lobby xray machine, which was our first experience of the hotel (with an unhelpful guard). Tired from travel, with heavy suitcases and two kids, it would have been great to have a duty porter to assist load the xray machine (if that doesn't breach security protocol). Talking through the perspex reception screen with everyone wearing face masks, leaning down to try to hear reception staff through the holes is a bit of a challenge. (again, a covid protocol).  It will be good when they can dispense with that discomfort. The overall experience, after the initial arrival and check-in, was very positive, however.",0.8888888888888888

 Booked an airport transfer service car and they forgot to pick us up on the scheduled time. Hassle to wait for so long. We booked another transport service and the driver left us after dropping us off in the venue. He was saying another person will pick us up. We had to call the hotel to pick us up. We were the last visitors and the security personnel had to help so we could go back to the hotel safely. Unfortunately we had to wait for hours and it was dark, raining and we were all cold and hungry from waiting for the driver to pick us up. driver was so reckless and there were instances of near miss and accidents that could endangered us passengers, other vehicles and pedestrians.Terrible hotel transport services!",0.5555555555555556

 We just stay here for one Night. The Size of the room was good and the staff was friendly. Also the style and the Interieur  of the hotel is nice.
 We just stay here for one night but experienced some negativ things about the hotel. First of All we arrived in the Buffet Restaurant and they told us that we will get a discount of 30% if were fully vaccinated (that was possible and definitly a positive point) and they told us if we're just 2x vaccinated (we get a discount of 20% - we had one person for that) - if we want to pay they told us the promo is not available anymore, but dont understand why they offer us before.
The Buffet for my opinion is very big and you have a lot of choises, thats why we been very excited. But for me the Quality was just middle - i defintily eat much better in different hotels in the Philippines.
Then unfortunately my little babyboy was sick and vomiting, thats why my wife decided to bring him to the room after the main course - so that we dont make any mess in the Restaurant and dont disturb the other guests. Because she cant really finish her dinner she was asking if I could bring her some little desserts to the room when im done - so I asked the Waitress and she asked the Manager- decision: not possible. I mean i can understand they want us to eat in the Restaurant and not in the room and i could also understand if we want to bring 5 platters with the main course but i just ask for one platter with just a little bit of dessert and i also told them i will bring the platter back after she finish. So i cant really understand their point even if we had a good reason because of my son.
The next morning we went to the Breakfast (buffet) and the lady at the check-in the other day offered us also a promo for the breakfast if im not wrong it was 540php instead of 988php and we said yes we want it please book that one for us. When we arrived at the Restaurant in the morning they told us no there is no promo booked for your room you need to pay the regulare price... after some minutes discussing they allow us to use the promo.",0.4444444444444445

 Very bad system of checking out. Only one member of staff on the front desk at 10:45 (the peak of checking out time is ridiculous) she was doing her best and it was no reflection on her but management needs to fix this. After a wonderful stay with excellent service it took the shine off of our stay, which is a shame and definitely not representative of my stay .
Also the tiles on the bathroom floor were dangerously slippery when wet. An issue the hotel must know about as there was a horrid (but clean) rubber mat in the shower. Unfortunately the rest of the bathroom floor was like an ice rink too.

 The staff at the hotel are undoubtedly its greatest asset. Their eagerness to assist and friendly demeanour greatly enhanced the overall experience. many of them even addressed my daughter by her name, which surely made her feel special and welcomed.

The water in the sea was crystal clear, offering a picturesque view. However, it is unfortunate that the mornings were marred by litter, requiring the staff to clean it before guests could enjoy the beach. This highlights the dedication and commitment of the staff to maintain a clean and enjoyable environment for everyone.
 What i didn't like was the children's activities were dependent on the weather and if there were any events on the boardwalk.  The hotel has a great playroom, however it is filled with inflatables only.  This is darkly lit in some areas and not well ventilated.   As there is a fee to join this playroom it would have been nice if there were other activities available for children including arts and crafts, shell crafts, and educational sessions about cebu sea life through colouring  for example.  This would be more engaging for children.

I found the sand was not real and hard for children to play with. Additionally, it would be great to have more tents / gazebos to provide shade for children as sun protection is essential.

It is unfortunate that there weren't many healthy choices on the menu.  Considering it is a family resort i didn't see a dedicated children's menu.  There were also no vegan or gluten free options.",0.5555555555555556

 We like how the staff treated us respectfully from check in to checkout. Everyone did a great job especially Christine at that check us in and Zee and her supervisor that took care of us at The View Lounge. The place has a lot to offer. Several dining options to choose from. The pool was the best part. The beach access was easy. The boardwalk was really nice to spend time and wait for sunset. The suite room with sea view was spacious for a family of 5 and we love the view from the balcony.  It was fairly clean as well as the restrooms. Included breakfast buffet did not disappoint.
 Room 2516 was hot when we came in and we thought the a/c was just turned on and still adjusting the temperature to our preferred setting. Voila! 3 hours later, the temperature inside the rooms (bedrooms and living room) remained at around 24  degrees Celsius even if we tried to set it up to around 20-22 degrees Celsius. We called front desk and they sent someone to check the first time and said just try to give it few minutes to adjust now. We closed the curtains to try and cool the rooms down without too much heat from the sun and we went to the pool for a couple of hours. When we came back it was still hot. We called front desk back and they sent somebody back the second time to check but nothing happened. So, we decided to just let it be since we were checking out the following day anyway. 

About 18 of us ate at Tradewinds during their Seafood Night Buffet with an agreeable price of around $34-$39 per person converted to US dollars. It was very disappointing because with that price they only offer WATER as your drink. Anything other than water adds up to your bill! What the heck is that? What kind of ""1st class"" buffet only comes with water with that kind of price? When we told the supervisor on duty our comment about it, he doesn't seem to care! Did not even comment back or even tried to do anything about our comment. 

The lobby was super hot as it is an open environment. The place needs more fan. At The View Lounge, their was only 1 fan shared by several guests there, We were not lucky enough to have it pointed on us until other people left about 9pm! We were there since 7:30 pm wiping our sweat off and hoping for more wind but it was not a windy or breezy night!",0.3333333333333333

 Great resort with the standard resort amenities. Decent private beach right behind resort. Loved the beach dinner event with buffet. Staff were always very super helpful and nice (though sometimes confused as different staff could give different answers).
 There was a corporate event for almost the entirety of our stay that blocked off several areas that would have been nice to enjoy. There were some noisy events in the evening but nothing super disruptive. Wish the beach was slightly nicer (or at least shuttles to nicer beaches) and there were more organized resort activities. We were told we had two double beds but they ended up being two twin beds. Wish TV allowed Netflix. TV was also broken - the screen would periodically go black so nothing watchable.",0.8888888888888888

 Okay, the location was a little on the further end. The staff was helpful and courteous, the accommodation was clean, and they gave us a free upgrade to a wonderful seaview.  Their large bed is the most comfy. We had a wonderful breakfast buffet option. Many hours were spent in their infinity pool. The area was kept up and kept clean all around. The Korean restaurant was rather good.
 We would prefer to watch Netflix or YouTube on their big screen TV, which is not an HD TV. I had to use my personal data wifi to complete some work because the internet was also sluggish. I like to play pool with my partner, but their cue sticks and billiard table weren't in great shape. We ordered pizza, beverages, and cocktails from Sunset Bar, and we felt it was decent considering the hotel's pricing.  We decide to get the most costly massage we have ever had since our final night. The service at NAMM SPA was appalling. It was a major letdown. After spending almost 10,000php on a 90-minute massage each for the two of us, we were dejected as we left the spa. The service was poor; there was no selection of oils given, and while the package claimed peppermint, I didn't smell any. When we first came, the room was unprepared, it was hot, and the air conditioner was hardly operating, they had to open the door. I coudnt breathe so I had to question the therapist why the AC was not working and room door is open. They moved us to another room they claimed was full where AC was working better. But I was already not in the mood.  No hot towel to wipe oils out of our body at the end of massage, feels like staff were in hurry to just go home. No choice of having tea inside the room after the massage but instead found the tea outside in the lobby. The massage itself was good and I would be happy to pay 799 for that service instead of 4800++/head . That was just disappointing!",0.5555555555555556

 I didn't like that there was no soap in the disabled toilet and  did not change even after we reported it. My husband is a liver transplatee and very important to keep in a sanitary environment.

 Dusit was an amazing stay as I went here for 2 nights alongside my partner. Firstly I'd like to shoutout Ruth, Zee and Leo for their amazing service, they were so welcoming, kind and showed fantastic customer service throughout our stay.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun.

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience.

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep. The bathroom and balcony areas were also really nice and clean.

Overall Dusit deserves its 5/5 rating and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would come back to relax here in a heartbeat.

 Breakfast was very disappointing. They seem to be trying to make a buffet with the cheapest food possible. Considering the price to stay there this is unacceptable.

Ordered a pizza and it came with absolutely no tomato sauce and one bite was enough to be turned off and send it back.

 Did not have much western food as compared to other hotels/resorts in Cebu. However, the staff was very helpful and attentive,
 1.  The lobby was an open air lobby. It is not advertised as open air. At a resort most people want to enjoy the outdoor facilities but when inside you want to be comfortable and not continually exposed to the 104 degree Fahrenheit heat index.

2.  On the Sunday night of my stay, someone had rented an area for some function.  The music this group was playing was way too loud. My room was on the 5th floor and sounded like we were in the room next to the party. When I called the front desk to ask about the noise I was told the music/ function would be going until midnight.  When the music continued to interfere with us trying to sleep, I called again and asked to speak with the Duty  Manager. He said he would speak to them. The music turned down to a tolerable level but could still be heard on the fifth floor.  The music finally stopped around 10:45 pm. The resort should ensure that any function or activity does not inconvenient other paying guests.",0.2222222222222222

 Wow Dusit Thani! We have stayed at many 5-Star resorts, but rarely see one so dedicated to visitor services and enjoyment as Dusit Thani!! We used Dusit Thani as a ‚Äúhub‚Äù for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.
 One bad thing we must point out. We stayed one night in a Club Room in Building 3 and the entire building and room smelled of mildew and was too hot out to open the windows. Yuck! Not sure if this is a persistent problem or not, but bad enough for us to never stay in that building again.",1.0

 We stayed here before, end of 2022. The feeling between then and now is that there are less amenities in the room. No laundry bag, only two towels, limited cans with shower gel and shampoo and the conditioning was even missing. Looks like the hotel is doing their best to be good for the environment while they also think about saving money to keep the room price affordable during this period with high inflation. Not all decisions are bad but two towels and no conditioning while all the Filipina‚Äôs with long hair use it‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.thats a wrong way of saving money. We called the reception and additional shower gel and shampoo was delivered, should not be the case.

 It really is a fantastic place. A very large resort area with multiple restaurants and bars, all of them good to very good. A decent private beach (as some reviewers mentioned the water is too shallow - maybe just check the tide times and have a swim when it's high tide, it's totally fine then). An extremely large infinity pool so it looks like it rarely ever gets crowded and feels nicely relaxed. 

The restaurants are excellent, the breakfast buffet is very very good, the staff is nothing short of fantastic.

Bear in mind, as some reviewers mentioned, this is a resort in a rather secluded area. You'd need a taxi to get anywhere else, unless you're fine buying stuff from nearby Sari-Sari stores or grab a beer with some local guys in a scruffy bar (which I'd actually recommend for a change of scenery). The resort character is exactly what you're here for though and you can see the location beforehand, so I don't see what's to complain about it.
 In general, the only noticeable minus is the pricing. Sure, this is a high-end resort, but even for that category it's pricey and at times feels like it's simply too much. Accommodation price seems justified, but for example prices for drinks or seafood buffet are definitely very high, and seem hard to justify on this level.",0.8888888888888888

Sports bar is fun and a good chill spot. The Club Lounge has a lovely afternoon tea set, but is otherwise a barren space that is under-utilized and unwelcoming.
 Many mechanical issues in both rooms, and furniture needs an update. Walls were too thin, could hear neighbor family. The Korean restaurant should be skipped entirely. Location is remote, with bumpy and dirty access roads.  Very hard to get Grab/Taxi.",0.6666666666666665

 Upon arrival, the space was extravagant - it was spacious, clean, and simply beautiful. The staff greeted us, and we started to get a glimpse of how exceptionally and seriously the staff took hospitality. From then on, we were greeted with a smile and a hello or good morning by the workers every day, and this made us feel very valued and seen as customers. Their hospitality was at times almost too much, but I suppose its only a good thing to say that the service was too good, or the people too nice. When dining, they saw the smallest details, and truly made our stay feel very special. 
The dining itself was very good. For the breakfast, they have a variety of food that fits both Asian and Western tastebuds, which was great for an interracial couple like ourselves. I liked that we could have our breakfast outside on the terrace and enjoy the views of the ocean as we ate our breakfast. The swimming pool is very clean, big, and we liked that we could order food and drinks by the pool area. 
For the room, it was much better than expected. We liked that it was just as the picture, if not better. The bed is big, the bathroom is nice, and the view is gorgeous - it was very satisfactory. 
We tried the spa facilities, and it was very nice.
 The location is not good. If you believe that the resort can provide everything you need, and that you will have no interest in leaving the resort, and exploring what Cebu is actually like for normal people - then don't worry about what I'm writing. The location is near the airport ... and that's about it. If you're staying there for a longer time, and get tired of the same food, same vibe, and same activities every day - the location doesn't have many other options for other things to explore. My suggestion would be to book an island hopping tour to get out and see some of Cebu, if you can afford the expensive options the hotel provides then go for it, it's a great way to get outside the bubble of the resort. However, these tours all mean that you have to drive for hours to get to the main sights, so if you're someone who wants to do water activities, or go sightseeing, I'd suggest a place in the city or somewhere near what you want to see. 

I wish there was a convenience store in the resort or a small booth that can provide products such as period products, or cigarettes. I called the room service line to ask if they were able to provide period products, or if that was something avaliable to buy at the resort, but unfortunately it is not. Make sure you bring what you need I guess, as the location doesn't provide much ability to go outside and get small things you need.",0.7777777777777777

 My stay at Dusit Thani was a great overall experience. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, the facilities are in excellent condition and the overall ambiance is also very nice, calm and relaxing. The pool is nice (it could be a bit deeper for my taste but it is ok), and the resort was not too crowded (I was there in the second week of February). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner can be taken at a variety of bars and restaurants, all of which had good food and a great view. The photos of the property really do reflect the place well.

On a side note: the fitness center is quite nice and one can get a decent workout in between relaxing at the pool and dinner!
 The location is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is close to the airport whilst not being affected by airport noise. On the other hand the road infrastructure there is less than excellent, and depending on the traffic it can either take 20 minutes or 90 minutes to get to and from the airport. Also, there isn't much around to see. I was planning on relaxing in the resort so this did not bother me at all, but if you want to explore a bit on foot it might not be the most exciting area as you have to take a taxi/grab to get to the next best starbucks. 

And, on a more related note: whilst the pool is great, the private beach is quite small and the ocean there is not suitable for swimming as it is quite shallow.",0.8888888888888888

the staff, in general, gives the appearance of being there to assist. 
the front office did try to resolve our issues by offering some extra when we brought up the issues we encountered
 Despite being 95% full occupancy, they did not have enough loungers set out by the pool. Unbelievably, on the first day we were told to sit on chairs(!) by the bar instead of arranging for extra lounges to be brought to the pool. In the following days, we raced to the pool to get a spot; not what I would expect in a 5-star resort.
Cocktails were constantly a hit-and-miss.
Every single time we wanted to order something they seemed to have run out of items. One day I wanted a smoothie, but I almost had to settle for Coca-Cola instead. How does a 5-star hotel run out of bananas or coconut in a tropical country when they are sold at every corner?! Every morning for breakfast there were bananas in the buffet restaurant but there were none at the pool bar for an afternoon cocktail or a smoothie(!?) How does a 5-starts resort run out of nachos and Royal (Fanta)? These are all items on the menu, not fancy requests of a spoiled customer. I don't believe these are hard-to-get or delicate items that cannot be stored for a long time. To then be told that it is because they had lots of customers for the Chinese New Year was the cherry on the cake. As if the event came as a surprise and they could not prepare for it. No one wants to spend so much money to travel this far (bear in mind the place is well isolated) and then hear such a sad excuse. All of this wouldn't bother me too much in other circumstances, but it is less acceptable in a 5-star hotel that puts on so much of a show. As a customer, when I choose a 5-star resort I do not want to find myself torn between whether I should keep compromising on my (not so unrealistic) expectations or spend my time making complaints and spoiling my inner peace.",0.5555555555555556

 The hotel is at a lovely location, once you get to it. We arrived at Mactan via ferry, and the hotel was an hour's ride through heavy traffic and some narrow streets.  Same narrow streets en route to the airport, but only a 30-minute drive. The infinity swimming pool is huge, about 100m long, and it was not too busy during our visit. The view across the sea to the mountains on Cebu island is lovely. The breakfast had good variety, but the cooks at the egg station had the smallest pan possible, a huge queue at the station, and were trainees: we never got properly cooked eggs and the wait was very long. The restaurants all (aside from the (fancy)Thai, on the second floor), all had outdoor seating and views of the sea.  The feather pillows and duvet are super comfy!

 Unfortunately I would not recommend (and in fact discourage) anyone from staying at Dusit Thani due to the extreme dampness of the rooms. We stayed in tower 3 and the room was extremely cold with staff having set the aircon as low as possible. When we turned the aircon off we discovered why - the room dripped with condensation and there was a strong smell of mold. My partner and I both left with terrible sinus infections. We did not ask to move again as we had already been shifted from another room where the toilet dripped and there was loud construction noise until late at night outside our room. Our friends stayed in another room and also had the smell of sewage in their room. Dusit Thani should not be allowing people to occupy these rooms as it is extremely detrimental to people's health, particularly anyone with respiratory issues. The quality of construction in the rooms is also very poor with wonky tiles, walls and uneven floors - not 5 star standard",0.1111111111111111

 From beginning to end: horrible stay - avoid this place at all cost

1. Room
Without asking, and without being told, I was apparently upgraded to a better room upon arrival. However, the room I was put in, which is building 3, was another level of disappointing. Sure, the room is spacious and had an ocean view but unless the AC was put on high at 20 degrees the room would start to literally sweat. water dripping from the walls, completely wet floor in the bathroom/toilet which is dangerous as extremely slippery, bed sheets were wet after a while so were my own clothes. It took half a day and me calling about 5 times for the hotel to find a solution. By the way, their initial proposal was to downgrade me with little to no apology. The new room I was in, had exactly the same issue. The hotel is just not build well. They called the ¬´¬†engineering team¬†¬ª about 3 times which proposed every time the solution of simply putting the AC at 20 degrees: this is not a solution, unless you want your customers to all become sick and catch a cold.
Most funnily, the first reaction of the staff was to say this situation was because I left the windows open, which I did not: putting the blame on the client and letting them deal half a day in a humid, wet rooms that smells like you are in an underground cave is not the best.

2. Room Service
Ordered a greek salad and a burger. The burger first came without the steak patty in it: so just buns and salad. The salad had half of the things mentioned in the menu. Tomato and feta cubes roughly cut with some salad leaf on top: no olive oil, seasoning. The cocktail, which was a pina colada, also did not have the coconut cream it mentioned to have in the menu. After complaining for the burger, a new one, or should I say the same one was delivered back just adding the overcooked patty that was missing. Fries were cold, so as the bun. They also brought a new salad, still the greek salad, although I did not ask for it.",0.0

 The hotel exceeded my expectations. The open lobby had a beautiful tree out for Christmas. There were a few varieties of places to get drinks and food. Not many local food options for lunch and dinner, but I am not a foodie, so I didn't mind the more international choices for food. The pool is spacious and I never had an issue getting chairs at various times throughout the day. I loved that the pool was open late, until 10 pm. The breakfast was great - so many options for different types of food & lots of local food options to try.
 The location was quite remote. Honestly, I did not mind this at all. We barely left the hotel grounds beyond going to eat in Cebu City one day and for massages at Cacao Tree Spa about 10 min away. There wasn't much to do close by in Cebu City as a lot of the attractions are further away on the island. It took about 30 min to get to the airport and about 45 min to get to Cebu City because of traffic. The hotel is very helpful at getting taxis when you want to leave the hotel. If you get stir crazy, maybe not the best hotel choice. I enjoyed the hotel itself because it had enough to keep me occupied and feed me for my vacation as we were aiming to relax and hang out.",1.0

 Dusit is a gorgeous resort. All of the facilities and amenities exceeded our expectations. The breakfast selection was huge. There was something there for everyone. There are other restaurants and a cafe on the property. The Thai restaurant was our favorite. The pool area was very big and it had plenty of seating for everyone. The concrete around the pool was never hot on your feet and it was non-slip. The property is very modern and clean. All of the staff were very helpful and friendly. We highly recommend staying at Dusit.

 The pool is great, but a few more chairs would be nice in addition to more places offering shade. The view is beautiful. Breakfast was differing a lot and choice was plenty. Rooms are clean and beds are comfortable. Staff is very friendly and supportive.
 The food is quite pricy for the taste/quality. The beach is very small and not sandy as promised. I guess therefore few people are using it (which is good if you like it quiet). There is nothing around the hotel, not even a super market or convenience store so you are absolutely relying on all the hotel facilities. Wouldn‚Äôt dare to take a walk around alone outside the hotel ground as the neighborhood is very rural and the traffic is terrifying.",0.5555555555555556

 There was a lot of staff in the lobby who greeted us when we arrived but no one helped us bring our bags and accompanied us to our room. The front desk just gave keycard and let us find our room.

Also, 30 minutes before we checked out, the staff knocked on our room and checked what was purchased on the snack corner, I was in the bathroom and in a hurry to open the door thinking it was something urgent.

 Staff that will just say ‚Äúyes ma‚Äôm,‚Äù with arrogance, instead of ‚Äúsorry,‚Äù when you make a disappointing observation. As if to tell you, that‚Äôs how five star hotel works and have to deal with it. They charge me the full price of my 3 nights stay as a security deposit(my stay was already fully paid before I arrived), booking.com states the security deposit will be 3k pesos, when I asked them about why full price, they told me it‚Äôs gonna be back to my account at check out, at check out, Kevin the front desk person told me, when I inquired, it‚Äôs gonna take 2 weeks to return to my account, didn‚Äôt asked me if I needed help for my luggages and just turned his back as soon as he told me I‚Äôm all set. I‚Äôve been hauling our luggages without anybody helping us, they‚Äôve just moving on and pretending they don‚Äôt see me and my companion, I‚Äôve seen them full force with foreign guests. You have to bring slippers for the bathroom, the design is weird, water floods all the way to the adjacent toilet bowl and it‚Äôs gonna be wet all day, have to open the window when you take a shower, ventilation doesn‚Äôt seem right, windows will be covered in mist/fog. The place is secluded from the modern(convenience store) amenities. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who stays in the room, at the bar, at the poolside, you‚Äôll be ok. But if you need something else, getting a grab ride will take a while, they have a hotel taxi which can cost a lot. Thy have free shuttle going to Robinson‚Äôs galleria(2x a day), free shuttle to a mall but not to the airport. The place is secluded but can be crowded, security guards are men with their handheld radios, with their stiff facial expressions, they don‚Äôt appear hospitable at all. I don‚Äôt mind paying for something that is to my expectations(5 star that is), this place is not worth what I paid for.",0.2222222222222222

 our room was unfortunately next to a family with a baby so we had to stay quiet and also the baby did cry throughout the night. We was only there for one night, so it didn't matter.

 If Heaven on Earth exists, The Dusit Thani certainly feels like such a place. The sunsets, atmosphere, absolute carefree environment. Resort is brand new, ideal for a couple that wants to do nothing but spend quality time together. The pool is amazing, with stunning views of the mountains and ocean. It is like a movie set. I have stayed in resorts all over the world, its not that this was the fanciest place, it is that the staff here is so very special. Warm, Attentive, friendly. I guess if I worked in a paradise like this, I would be happy everyday. The breakfast buffet is very special. The fruit here taste like nothing we have in the US, homemade organic honeys, juices, out of this world. Thai rest also, amazing, wonderful experience. The pool bar food, also excellent, loved the pizza. The oceanview room is a nice large size, with a great sized balcony. The room has a great fridge also. Some thanks you's to Wonderful staff, Enan, The rest. Manager, Ravi the Chef, Friendly Mary, part of the breakfast team, and Niki from the pool bar. No amount of money is a big enough tip for these wonderful people here. My girlfriend and I will be back to the Dusit Thani sometime this year, and I cant Wait.

 The pool was lovely and the staff were very friendly.
 the shower flooded the whole bathroom floor and outside the door even if taking a short shower. We reported this to the front desk but no effort to fix or change rooms. the hotel had very few guests and yet ran out of towels by 10am and we were told more towels would be dropped off at 11.30am. the music at the pool was terrible. loud and more suitable to a night club than a family resort during the day.",0.4444444444444445

 1) Resort is really nice.  The view bar area is truly a great spot to hang out.
2) Staff were extremely friendly to myself and my mother who are from the US.
3) Service was exception for myself and my mother who are from the US.
4) The infinity pool is quite a treat.  
5) There is a kids play area that is indoors which we didn't know about until we got there.  It was really fun for our 4 year old son, and they do provide supervision at all times while children are playing in the area.  300 PHP for 1 hour or 600 PHP for the full day.
 1) My biggest issue was the service to my wife and mother in law who are native to the Philippines.  They were guests just like myself and my own mother, but when I was not in the vicinity of them.. the service was a completely different experience.  The staff would not do simple things like refilling water at the table, and they would not make eye contact and engage them either.  I remember returning to the resort after island hopping carrying a bag full of snorkeling gear and not one person even asked to look in the bag.  That same bag the prior day when we returned my mother in law was carrying it.. and when I was not with her entering the resort they made issue of it and searched the bag.. and made her go through a metal detector. (as another example)  My wife was quite upset with this fact, and it bothers me as well.  Every guest should be treated with the same level of service.  
2) There is a corkage fee to bring a single bottle of wine from outside into your room, and that was 1500PHP per bottle.  What was surprising about that is you can purchase a bottle of wine in their deli at the resort for 500-700PHP on the low end. The front desk agent told me that the bottles in the deli  were all 1500PHP.
3) Could not find spa service pricing anywhere online for the resort spa.  The only way to see pricing was to go to the spa when it was open and come to find that the prices at the resort spa are the same price you would pay in the US for full body massage for example.  You can take a taxi to two nearby spas (5 minute drive) and only pay 27$ US for a full body 90 minute massage.  Quite interesting that they don't advertise the pricing considering this fact.
4) There really isn't much beach front.  There was a tiny manmade beach one one side of the resort, and it was not appealing at all.",0.4444444444444445

 It could benefit from more options for food as well as a place to purchase convenience store items.

I mention more options for food because the Sunset Sports bar is very underwhelming in its service. The food is not bad but when you see customers left waiting, to get orders or receive their change,  it doesn't leave a good impression.

This hotel nowhere a 5 star resort and shouldn't even be carrying the prestigious name Dusit.
I need to comment Kevin who has been doing a great job in the beach bar and serving us at the pool. Good job..
 Low quality materials used for the way too small rooms. Rooms looks like a 89$ city hotel and not like a 5 star resort room you charge $300 per night. It's completely laughable. If you present such room to travelers in Bali, Phuket or Phu Coq you might have a riot at your hands. This hotel only exists to cater to Korean tourists. Every expat or local who knows what a real 5 star hotel is like will avoid this place like the plague. We are so disappointed.
No balcony, view is facing an ugly blue condo bldg.
No shower separation, water runs free in the bathroom like in a cheap roadside motel.
Upon arrival bags were taken out of our hands without a greeting, not a word. Handed a luggage stub. NO WELCOME DRINK, nothing.
The worst unhelpful concierge ever. Unprofessional behaviors by staff all 3 days. Waiter asked me at the view bar where I'm from, when I replied that I'm German he said "" oh wow, that's from where Hitler was, that very bad president, I saw Schindlers List and needed to cry"" Excuse me ??????
Coffee and hot chocolate are served without saucer. Dishes at the pool ignored for hrs even dozens of time staff passed by. Hot chocolate for 250 pesos which is just Swiss miss and no hot chocolate.
Does the manager ever do a walkabout on the premises? Trash everywhere in the garden, same as swimming tissues in the pool and whatnot..I'm completely speechless.
I stayed in Dusit hotels over, just recently in Davao and BKK which both were fantastic in terms of staff and room etc. This place is nothing but an unprofessional overpriced tourist trap for Koreans.
Upon check out of course no receipt was given. He didn't even put the SOA in an envelope to hand it to me, he simple kept it. No OR. Hello BIR?
We left for the airport, 3 staff behind the FO jokingly entertaining themselves, several bellboys only chatting, not even looking at us bringing our own luggage to the car. The worst of the worst ever.

 1) Staff is friendly and tries to help within their boundaries
2) Price range is within my budget given I am not willing to pay too much when most of the time i am not in the hotel. Other hotels like shangri-la or Shenton would have been too pricey. However it is still steep and comparable price to certain 5 star hotels back in Singapore
3) Availability of services like Pool, dining in restaurants (given the distance to everything else you may wish to have a nice dinner in the hotel after a day of tours), 24 hr room service etc.
 - Digital TV with the channels did not work for 2 days which I always like to turn on as background noise when I am in the room.  No attempts at service recovery though its not a huge matter for me since I am not always in the room. A simple later check out time even by 1 hr would be nice but no such offer even though I asked for one.
- Walls are super thin. At 1 point I can heard our next door neighbors having their conversation as though they were standing right next to me. I feel bad since I have early days (4am hours) and getting ready would have disturbed them.
- Taxis are a challenge. I had to wait sometime for the hotel to get me one. However when I was at Shangri-la (for lunch) they seem to a couple of taxis already on standby. I guess the difference in price do show.
- Provided towels in the room are bare minimum, ie 2 towels for 2 guests for showering. 5 star hotels usually provide separate towels per guest for washing of face, additional shower towels sometimes etc. In a way I supposed its more green ..
- Wife could not find the hair dryer in the room so likely housekeeping forgot about it. When we had it sent up, it did not work...
- 2 very small bottles of water to last your day. Keep in mind there is no gift shop/convenient store on hotel grounds that you can purchase bottled water.",0.4444444444444445

 Dear all

I would like to write you this e-mail, to share with you my disappointment regarding my stay in your hotel.

First of all, I want to let you know that we are travelling for the last 28 days as we are honeymooners and we visit more 3 continent and more than 8 cities and hotels and this was our unique misadventure.

We checked in on Feb 6th and our room was great but without a view nor a balcony and despite of the fact that I informed the hotel that we are honeymooners, you just did a bed decoration upon request on the second day. 
We kindly asked the reception to move us to a room with a balcony and they find us a king size bed room with a view but it would be better if not.

Our room now is 3410 and is way downgraded compared to the 2505.
The bathroom floor is wet since yesterday night and in some places dirty, the walls are wet also because of the humidity, and on the top of it the pillow smells moisture and the towels are extremely used.

My wife is allergic, spent a horrible night, and this is really irritating.

I strongly recommend you send your team to the room to acknowledge how critical the situation is.

 Infinity pool was really beautiful, overlooking the ocean. There are sufficient daybeds for the number of guests in the hotel and lots of other lounging areas around that overlook the ocean. Rooms are also well furnished, beds are really comfortable with bathtub for use.
 Hot water in the room isn't hot at all, showers at night were really cold.

Food - service is slow, at the sunset bar, food takes 20-30 mins to serve even when its not crowded. Quality of food across all the restaurants in the hotel also leaves more to be desired. For the amount they are charging, I think they can do a much better job with the food - pasta, korean dishes, thai dishes were all lacking. Only the burger was decent

Service - service in general is inconsistent. Some staff were really friendly and welcoming, but some weren't very helpful. I left my Fitbit watch in the spa on the last day and only realised when I was at the airport. Managed to contact them after a lot of hassle and they promised over the call to reach out to me thru WhatsApp after I hung up, but after almost 24hours, I'm back in my home country and I haven't received any replies to my messages or email. I'm hoping they will get in touch about my watch, and if they do, I'll edit this review accordingly. But for now, a little disappointed in their service and help.",0.5555555555555556

we were trying to book for a dinner reservation on Christmas Eve but staffs were redirecting us to different locations (as no one was stationed at the reception) and we kept walking around the lobby from the reception to the sunset bar back to reception then tradewinds cafe

Very good breakfast with a lot of various options
 - Extremely slow on check ins and outs.

- Only one power plug next to beds in a twin bed room

Liked the front desk when we checked in, just trace who did that in our records.
 Humiliation In Sunset bar started after occupying a table for 15 min and started ordering ala carte my family was asked to moved out because waiter and Manager told us they cater only to Buffet clients. In full view of other clients.  They should have put a sign at the access areas that its only for Buffet clients OR they cordoned off a place specifically for ala carte only and/or Buffet only.

We were asked to move to The view.  Imagine eating Family Dinner meal crouching because  table and chairs were not dining tables and dining chairs.

Earlier on, Food served especially the Baby back ribs were tough and tastes sub par.  You cannot say ""compliments to the Chef""..  Food taste doesnt match with what to expect for a world renowned Hotel.

TAKING a bath inside the room posed a problem as the water leaked outside the perimeter of the bath area onto the Toilet bowl area. Must be because of the flat design of the floor.

 We did not like property, we came from 11 hour flight and we arrived in the hotel at 2AM in the morning to relax. When we arrived in the room, there was foul smell and when we checked, there was molds all over the curtian. 
We immediately request to change room and it was already 4AM and we did not have sleep.  In the other room we were not able also to relax as the whole room (floor, wall, mirror, cabinets) is wet of moisture. Even our stuff is wet - luggage, shoes, including the furnitures and our comforter. 
What is worst was, we almost slide in the toilet because of moist in the floor and in the morning we have colds and cough due to moist, three of us my wife and my child. It is very unusual experience we had and very bad one. I was not convinced with their explaination as I have experience in the industry.

 I enjoyed infinity pool, grand luxury ambience of entire hotel, spacious, clean, relaxing & luxurious  atmosphere, the luxurious amenities, comfy luxurious beds
 During this trip - the room i reserved was not available upon check-in .... and staff did not inform us that room was not available  - staff simply put us into whatever room was vacant ... i had to put a lot of request  and back and forth to get the type i reserved ... staff soon put us into a suite room .... but told us 2 reservations will now have to stay in 1 suite having 2 rooms & bath ....

This did not work for us, as the point of having 3 separate reserved rooms was to have each of our privacy .... i had to escalate and and after close to 3 hrs of discussions ... staff agreed to maintain our 3 separate room reservations - the wrong type of room was upgraded to a suite 

By the time we were able to check-in and unpack luggages ... it was after 7pm .... check-in was at 4pm .... that meant ... we (7 people/ 2 families) were waiting in 1 room while staff figured out how to resolve ...

Note - that one of the 2 in-house restaurants was scheduled to close at 9pm ..... and it took 45 mins. to have all our ordered meals arrive ...

 The room was lovely, clean and very comfortable. The pools were beautiful, clean and a good temperature. The staff were generally good. The food overall was good, particularly good in the thai restaurant. It was nice to sit at the sunset bar and watch the sunset. The facial in the spa by Neri was absolutely amazing. The spa is particularly luxurious and it was very easy to get a booking. 
Staff that were especially amazing include Lovely at the Deli, Gabriel at the front desk, and Jahil and Tina at the sports bar.
 There was a lot of construction going on, which meant the main lobby bar was basically unusable. Unfortunately there is a big tanker that sits right in front of the sunset, so we didn't get the sunset views we were hoping for. I'm not sure if it is because it was low season, but the only food options were the sports bar and the thai restaurant. The service was inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad. The soundproofing in the rooms was not very good at all, I could hear the next room watching tv and even their 6am alarm. There is also no store to buy additional items, which is difficult as the hotel is at least 2km away from the nearest 7/11.",0.6666666666666665

- This is a 5 star hotel, but they did not even have welcome drink, What a dissapointed service.
- They have flyer that there is free shuttle bus to Nustar resort and casino, but when I booked it, they said it`s not available on weekdays. If like that, you should make better advertisement.

 The building is new though there were still parts being repaired or renovated due to the previous year's typhoon. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant to the guests.

Thai restaurant on the 2nd floor served delicious dishes with fresh ingredients. Bar on the ground floor also served good Filipino dishes. They also have really good breakfast. Though I missed it, I heard they serve taho (silken tofu) during the weekends in a very traditional Filipino way of serving i.e., with a vendor carrying taho containers on a bamboo pole on his shoulder and yelling ""taho!

 This resort is overrated compared to other 5-star facilities in Mactan (e.g. Shangrila, Plantation Bay and Solea). Nothing is special about it except for the bigger pool that they boast about. The rooms are poorly maintained (toilet walls not wiped clean, bathroom doors and wardrobes are not in good condition - I couldn't close my bathroom door at all!). Pillows are not comfortable enough and had some pungent smell (smells like urine) on them. The food they serve (via room service) are super expensive but not really tasty.

 Didn't take breakfast... wanted to leave.
 It already started bad, during check in.. requested a extra bed during booking. During check in said was an extra 2k PHP. So said on website state, kid until 13 is free of charge. Then there was suddenly no upcast anymore, but needed to pay for breakfast. Okay no problem... So I said, why do you not ask before making any comment.. or check her passport yourself. So I asked, is the extra bed in the room or not.. she said no... Finally when to the room, guess what.. the extra bed was there. Only the extra towel wasn't. So when going for dinner, passed by the reception, and said.. well your info is not correct, the extra bed is there, only one towel missing. Her comment.. maybe they did do that during check in.. I said you are really funny ;-). 

Dinner in the 'The view"".. well that's another story... Ordered food. A chicken Soup, which was the highlight of the stay, as the simply was really nice and good. Unfortunately needed to ask after ¬± half hour when my food would be served, but first needed to catch the attention of at least 7 people staff, who were having a great time together chatting and laughing but not paying attention to the few tables. My food was served... but when ingredients are present which you do not eat, which are not specified on the menu, is not helpful. 

The fact that there are works, due to the typhoon Odette is normal and they try to minimize. The fact that a big ship broke loose during the typhoon and now is within ocean view scenery is bad luck for them... so I suggest, look left on your balcony.

The best part and smoothest one, was my request earlier checkout. That was smooth, quick, efficient and friendly. First time they performed up to the standards, and of which I am thankful how they did handle and process.

 Really disappointed with the property. We were put in building three where we were met with a very damp smell as soon as we entered the building and our room. Once we lay on the bed it was evident that the bed and bedding was also damp. We complained to reception who told us they had no rooms in another building but could move us to a new room in the same building. So we agreed which smelled lovely but left for dinner for a few hours and upon returning to the room we were met with the same damp smell. It was clear to us that the staff had just sprayed the room with air freshener. We complained once again and magically they had a room for us in the other building.

Those who relieve the fatigue of travel while taking a shower with warm water. There is no hot water in this hotel.

People who are sensitive to sound when sleeping. A sound like raindrops falling on an iron roof came from the vents and disturbed my sleep.

In addition, there are many places where the paint is peeling off or the facilities are being repaired, so the aesthetics are not good.

 The TV in room and movies option was good. Some of the staff we friendly and some could work on being friendly.
 False advertise, there was no fitness centre, even though was stated that it was available on website. Spa room unavailable but only option was to be done on bed which was not ideal. Bufet was not best and food cold, was off putting. To much yellow caution tape around and put me off a bit. Noise in night, think construction and you can hear through walls quite easily and hallways.

Restaurants all serve the same menu, that was rediculous for the price to stay at resort and food was quite expensive I find for what I was getting. 

There was no house keeping for rooms unless you called for it to be service. Was not told on arrival but to find out when I saw a room being attented to. They said you need to call to prebook and it is due to pandemic. I was like really, or was it to minimise on cost. 

Was annoying to always call house keeping or hopefully catch someone in hall way if you cannot reach them. 

There was no Managment on site to talk to at all, no Duty Manager. Reception can only listen and help as far. 

Beach closes at 5pm, was told no life guards around that time, pool closes at 8pm even though it is 4 foot pool all around. Was told is to service the pool but there are guest who are not kids are would like to enjoy the pool a little later than earlier.

Kids are in same pool as adults, a little noisy. Would of liked to enjoy a little peace and quiet by the pool and not kids running up and down.

 The property is beautiful.  Just a renovation work in progress, since they‚Äôve been hit badly by typhoon Odette.  It was a busy weekend, being a long one since it was a holiday in Cebu.  Service is wonderful.  Restaurant for dinner was at the Sunset cafe temporarily, since the typhoon, so not all items on buffet needing warmers had it, so some were cold.  My table reservation was given to somebody, disappointing, but accommodated with my demand to be given what was available/reserved for a different group who didn‚Äôt arrive.  They were busy, and staff still coping‚Ä¶needing improvement, but staff are all kind and hospitable.  Beautiful rooms, beautiful design of resort, well planned for the property they have in Mactan Cebu.  White sand beaches is not something to expect in Mactan Cebu, just an fyi.  But being by the sea is still calming and relaxing, and they have a nice huge pool.  Still a good relaxing stay over all.  I would come back.

 No Wi-Fi and no pool due to the bad weather (understandable). 

Since majority of their amenities aren't available, they should have opened their indoor facilities like their gym (if they have), spa and the like. What we did was just go to the room, wander a bir and eat in their expensive restaurant (not even a discount).

 PROS: Pool area was so nice, room was great, everything was perfect. The elevator didn't take forever. I had had a very bad experience at another hotel that I initially booked, which was a scary experience for me so I came here last minute knowing that it would be quite the opposite. So thank you for helping me out here! The lunch and dinner options were super great.
 CONS: Ok this is more personal preference, so please take it as one person's opinion. I would have liked to just be called by my name and not ""ma'am"" constantly. I know this is a 5 star experience, so it is to be expected. Though I was referred to as ""ma'am"" only in the Philippines and not just at this hotel (traveled to 3 other SE Asian countries and they treated me normal) and it just felt like it created an uncomfortable divide. 

I was even asked if I preferred to be called just my name, which I said ""yes"" to and then was immediately called ""ma'am"" again by that same staff. I do not need to be treated like royalty, but again I understand that this is a 5 star hotel so it is possible many prefer that treatment here. I just think it is good to ask first for preference from guest and then actually listen to their answer.

 The staff was very friendly and professional. The spa was the highlight of the trip as far as adult things go. Our daughter (2yo) was having the time of her life at the pool and slides.
 The facility is not properly maintained, the pools are all cracked and need to be repainted/sealed the Jay Park Island sign is basically gone from the top of the building which makes me think that it was put together unsafely. The pororo Park was disgusting my daughter didn't mind but the water play area had so much debris the entire kids indoor experience was very unsanitary. It  was 28 USD for me to go with my daughter to Porroro Park and it was absolutely not worth it. A lot of the activities were either broken or poorly maintained. 

The check-in experience was horrible. I reserved our room with a king bed one month prior and it wasn't ready at our 3:00 p.m. check-in time they tried to ""upgrade"" us to a villa which seemed great but we were in that room for less than 5 minutes because it smelled and there was mold in the bathroom. We ended up getting the room that we actually paid for and finally checked in at about 4:20 p.m.. 

The food was terrible as far as good healthy selections go, an exception to this was the Chinese restaurant which we ate at twice, the Korean restaurant was also pretty good. Coral and the j lounge and the pool lounge restaurant all basically have the same menu and are very overpriced for what it is. I ordered tacos and my wife ordered caprese salad. The tacos were sloppy with most of it being different sauces with very little meat. The caprese salad seem to have had a pesto sauce on it that tasted like cut grass. Even when we ordered pancit, the flavor was there but the ingredients were not fresh. 

The bartenders were very slow and the entire staff seemed overwhelmed and not prepared for the amount of people that were there. They were, however, friendly and professional.",0.5555555555555556

 Fantastic place for young kids. A number of swimming pools that cater for babies, toddlers and older kids with lots of pool beds that had shade. The pool bar was also great, and you could order food as well. The food options were great, there are a number of restaurant options with good food and service. Also the nighttime entertainment was excellent too. We had a great time.
 It was a bit annoying that you had to pay extra for the Pororo play area and also for the Segway cars. Also the pools probably need a bit of maintenance as some of the paint at the bottom was peeling off. The decor in the rooms was a bit dated too but that didn‚Äôt really matter as the rooms was spotless and the beds were comfortable.

You had to pay for almost all the hotel facilities (even for the table tennis and snooker). I reached there after 10 hours travel at 12:00 noon with my 4 year old daughter and the lady in reception asked me to pay another 500 pesos for early check in although I had informed them previously and the room was ready. Note that in my all other stays in other 5* hotels in Cebu I was never asked to pay.

 UNFRIENDLY STAFF NEAR THE BIG SLIDE. He told us that go-pros were not allowed at all which was ok. We asked him for the direction of the lockers and he points us in the general direction where its at. He does it with a scowl though and is clearly tired of people asking him the same questions over and over again. He does see that my girlfriend was wearing a necklace and fails to tell us that too wasn't allowed. The lockers are a fair distance from the big slide so he could've mentioned it before we deposited our go-pro. When we came back to the slide, he told us we still weren't allowed to get on because of the necklace then points us to a sign with tiny letters and paragraphs telling us what we couldn't wear. Keep your signs simple. Use symbols. Hire a new guy there. If he's sick and tired of his job don't take it out on us. We got too upset to get on. Since the giant slide was the reason why I chose this resort over the others, it was disappointing that I never got on it. Never going here again. Aside from that, the resort caters well to children but keep in mind that since it's more family oriented, the breakfast buffet gets very full and very loud very fast.",0.4444444444444445

 I like the flexibility of the hotel in allowing us to check-in early and check-out late with a minimal fee of P500 pesos. The ladies at the Check-in counter  are very courteous and helpful. The breakfast menu lacked some of the basics of real Filipino breakfast like bacon, tocino, longganisa, danggit but there were other alternative food choices like fish fillet,  curry, sushi and lots of bread which we enjoyed very much. Surely, I will recommend to friends with young kids.

The stated 24/7 valet parking doesn't exist. At all. But they sent a bellhop with me in car to take me to parking. Which is a 1km drive to end up 45 secs walk from elevators.

 The service provided from security to door-persons to bell hops to concierges to one specific front desk lady(Steph) to all housekeeping who serviced our rooms.  All very service oriented.
 One front office did not check properly that our room has been fully paid and called me back after I checked out saying that there is still half of the bill unpaid.  It was embarrassing as I even paid for my laundry bill the day prior we were to check out to prevent any delays and hassle during check out date.  I had to remind the lady that I paid for 50% deposit way ahead of time when she was saying that I only paid for half when my card was swiped during check in date when it was actually charged for full balance payment upon checking in time.   She appeared to even doubt what I was saying and I was on the verge of opening my email and scrolling to locate my email thread with my deposit payment proof then she said let me check again.  She should have been thorough before putting a guest in an unnecessary embarrassing situation.  It would be good that front desk staff are trained to check before chasing a client and saying ‚Äúhindi pa po kayo bayad.‚Äù  The person she asked to run after me was nahihiya somehow to say it kasi nga nakakahiya nga naman if it were true.  Rather than ruin my day, I just had to keep calm.

Further, when I had queries right after using the Bookings app and called in for room verifications versus the description stated on the app, Seda front desk canNOT answer queries properly.  There seemed to be a lack of knowledge as to their rooms‚Äô features.  How can they sell the rooms if they do not even know what to answer.  I had to ask the reservations person to at least go to the rooms and revert after inspecting the rooms.  They just kept insisting that the powder room/guest bathroom is a piece of mirror which boggled me.  As I have never come across a powder room that does not have a lavatory and a water closet.  Thankfully, the person in the end after quite a bit of discussion agreed to do an ocular of the room I was verifying and called me back to confirm that what was described in Bookings app is wrong and I had to make an upgrade instead.",1.0

 Well, the hotel is outdated . Needs renovation, and the pictures don't reflect reality
. Never the less they maintain it quite well. 
But the noise from the traffic easily gets inside the room, especially at night you want to sleep. 
This is due to old alumimiums with the  single.glrass layer. Also, there is a new construction going on next to the hotel that makes the noise situation even worse. 
The internal soundproof simple doesn't exist. You can listen to everyone speaking  next room easily..

He's got a problem with western men who date Filipino women and makes it very obvious. I got thick skin so if he managed to work me up its pretty bad.

 NO DRESS CODE!  It is imperative to have a dress code  posted  on the main entrance of the dining area, especially  during breakfast hours.   I have seen  male guest walking in with his sleeveless shirt and exposing his underarm when reaching for  the food buffet. For a 5 Star hotel and  by allowing such guest to come in, it compromises sanitation.  The guess is NOT at fault because NO DRESS CODE POSTED on the main entrance of the dining area.

 If you‚Äôre booking for someone else (e.g. my parents in my case) be prepared to sign an ‚Äúauthorization form.‚Äù They want the original card used for the booking to be presented in the check-in counter, in my case it was impossible.

The staff was very swift in sending me the form that needs to be filled up, attached together with my scan copy of my pertinent card details and a valid Philippine ID.

 The hotel is literally a few steps away from Ayala Center Mall. The staff were courteous and polite and the breakfast selection was excellent.
 The front desk was understaffed. There were only two staff manning the counters for both checking in and out as well as for other concerns. There were no bathrobes which is usually available at hotels within this price range. The towels were particularly old, darkened, and hard from repeated use. And the bathroom amenities were certainly not at par either. The lobby has this annoying loud music which were neither calming nor pleasant. I‚Äôve stayed at other Seda hotels and expected more, but turned out dissatisfied. I guess I‚Äôll be staying somewhere else when I‚Äôm in Cebu next time.",0.6666666666666665

Stayed in one of their junior suites, air condition was working well and the wifi was strong too.

they asked me to leave security deposit which would never asked in other branches. refusing to put anything in room charge. when I asked them to show me this policy they didnt. 

the room was not comfortable and clean as i expected of other branches.
very commercial and I wouldnt stay nor advise anyone to stay in this branch",0.0

pros:
- the location: it's near Ayala shopping mall, a lot of taxis and drivers know where it is.
- the staff is very friendly and always try to accommodage requests
- they have healthy meals which is great for those with dietary restrictions
- love the breakfast buffet
- fast wifi. my work is zoom-heavy and I was able to work without any internet issues
 cons:
- DUSTY! the room at first glance looks clean, but the corners and under the furniture are dusty, and the a/c is dusty too- it looks way overdue for a deep clean
- staff can be slow, especially in the restaurant, maybe they're understaffed? 
- the breakfast buffet is worth the price. lunch was consistenly the worst- with presentation, taste, and portions lacking. 
- dinner buffet is mediocre. don't go an hour before it closes, the meats are dry and bard, everything has been overcooked because of the warmer and lights.",0.7777777777777777

 limited information from Reception at time of checking in. asked for security deposit, gave me their inclusive menu, and showed me to my quarantine room. it got worst after typhoon Odette hit Cebu everything was a mess, phone kept on ringing for ages. and if answered, either I was put on hold or can‚Äôt give me any assurance about the delay in my PCR swab, considering the hotel was classified as Multi-purpose Quarantine Hotel they weren‚Äôt helpful and can be very frustrating. suffice to say, my quarantine stay was extended and stayed 8 days in total. being a ROF I had to pay for everything myself.

The food was really good, they even ask you for your preferred next meal if you are picky; the servings were also enough. 

I especially appreciated their hospitality. On the day of my check-out, the test results were released very late and I couldn't check-out by noon. They let me stay in the room til 6PM for free, or until I got my test results.

Their food is always well presented and they do theoir best to make the food as authentic as possible.  Their Pizzas are particularly good as are the desserts.
 Staff can be very helpful, but ocassionally the check-in staff can be a bit short and dismissive.   I sent an email to the Hotel informing them that my fiance would be arriving around three hours before me and that they should let her into the room.  She ended up having to explain all sorts of things to the check-in staff to be able to get into the room when she arrived.  Then they gave her a lower grade room.

 The room smelled musty, we wanted one bed, but they gave us two single beds pushed together. They literally just pushed together, obviously, there was a gap in between so it's still like sleeping on a separate single bed. We thought that they would at least modify the bedding and the linens. Speaking of beddings and linens, they had this old, mostly, mouldy smell. The toilet was clogged after one use, the THERMOSTAT WAS BROKEN. It was 11 degrees in the room when we woke up after our first night. We left the hotel slightly under the weather because of the irregular and dysfunctional thermostat. The floors and even the carpet were sticky. We can hear the people from across the room and they weren't even being loud. They were just having a normal conversation but we can still hear them.

 The rooms were very clean and spacious. They are a bit out dated but the hospitality and amenities definitely make up for it. The beds are quite comfortable and the AC was able to keep our room at a decent temperature. The Wi-Fi though could use some work. The signal was very spotty. It was either too weak to connect or not strong enough to keep a stable connection. At one point I just started using my data because I got frustrated with the constant disconnects. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when we asked questions, always smiling and greeting us when passing in the halls or lobby. Check in did take longer than usual as there was only one receptionist, we arrived around 7PM, but when we checked out a few days later there were 3 people working front desk. The pool area is HUGE and there is a life guard on duty, good idea since the main pool is quite deep right from the start. I'm 5'6"" and  couldn't touch in the centre. There is a kiddie pool separate from the main pool as well. The hotel offers swimming lessons for kids which was really nice to see. Unfortunately the waterfall was under construction but the outdoor area was still beautiful and we enjoyed our afternoon there. There were plenty of loungers and seating available around the pool so finding a close seat was never an issue. 
In the mornings there is an outdoor space, same area as the pool, to enjoy yoga and the gym was one of the nicest ones I have seen in any hotel (or some gyms even!). There is room service, avail 24 hours, and a few restaurants on site. However they were a little over priced so we opted to eat out or have delivery. We don't gamble so we never bothered to check out the casino side but it looked quite popular. At the main entrance there is security and a dog on site to ensure the guests safety. 
We had such a relaxing vacation and a great time visiting the city. Highly recommend staying here if you get the chance.

The front desk said they had to call their credit card processing company and manually cancel it and suggested I dispute the charge. This is at check in I'm being told to dispute a charge.

What was disappointing was I had to negotiate hard for a paper CC payment (as I didn't have a physical CC) and that they would only allow one night accomodation and no food. The room was very average and given they would only allow me to pay for one night I went to a better quality hotel",0.3333333333333333

 Nice ambience, lobby and building. Good AC, warm water, but no shower handle. Ok morning robe and slippers, but you have to ask for it.
 Worn down, elevators don't show if they go up or down(!), pool area still under renovation after several years.
Breakfast don't even have decent bread, warm food is of the cheapest kind and they us the smallest glasses (like in budget hotels).
No more valet parking and parking garage is a disaster. You have to walk quite far and then drive down several levels just to get out and they demand payment to leave, if you don't have a validation slip (like in cheap hotels). Too much hassle. Parking outside the lobby too strict, considering the inconvenient and time-consuming garage,
Casino worn down, no bar or decent drink service, very few games. They didn't even have Black Jack or Roulette (last on request and therefore mostly empty).

 Its an okay stay for me. I was expecting better room design but I guess since this is an old hotel. So the design of the room is already old compared to newer hotels. I did not see a mini bar though. breakfast was at 500 per person and I was told that its 750 or was it 800 if I will just go directly during breakfast and pay at their restaurant. So I took their promo and well, the breakfast was just ok. its not that great. but its not also bad. we went during Holy Week, we check in for 1 day during Friday and check out Saturday. I thought their casino would be available but unfortunately its Friday and Saturday. I choose this hotel thinking that they are operating their casino during Holy week. But unfortunately it was not.
 When I first entered their room. I did not like the smell. I guess its their air freshener that they used. its just does not smell nice. Its a little strong and kind of confusing. its like an old smell.",0.6666666666666665

 This hotel is absolutely beautiful. Service is exceptional, we had to leave super early for a 6am flight, I had accidentally booked this hotel thinking it was the one in front of the airport, although they weren't able to switch my bookings they more than happy to find us a taxi to pick us up early in the morning. Hot water, bed was decent. I was unable to use any of the good amenities that I saw, since our flight was so early. I saw a casino and I believe I saw they had a bar, room service, though more on the expensive side, had a lot of options and is 24 hours when I was there.
 There is a limited amount of plugs in our room, though it's not a big upset, it was still a little inconvenient. There is quite a big step to simply get in the shower, I did find it a little strange. A big upset that there are two waterfront hotels. This one, and the one right next to the airport, and unfortunately I wasn't able to cancel my reservation without a fee, though it is my fault for not paying attention.",0.8888888888888888

 The on-site registration/rebooking. The room and the room maiden. The Breakfast. The hotel included restaurants. The Hall for our venue. The cocktails. The experience and the appearance. Elevators: Fast and big.
 The online registration. If  i am the manager, i would fire the responsible persons. I could not book the whole needed time online because of a voucher. I could only book the voucher-attached times. So, i ask by email before to extend my booking. No answer. So i extend the needed day by booking.com and ask for connecting the bookings to use the same room. First Answer: No Problem. Second Answer: Not possible. I was already really pissed off by the waterfront hotel! But the on-side desk corrects anything. No problem, Sir! This changed my mindset for the Waterfront.

 For dinner we didn't try the dinner buffet because we were not hungry enough so we decided to order Ala Card. The food in the Uno restaurant is very delicous and the stuff are very friendly as always but how can you forget the plates. But how can it happen that the dimner will be served but nobody noticed that we do not have any plates. How are we supposed ti eat it. So we gave the restaurant another try at the next day during the breakfast buffet. The choices are great, stuff were very helpful and food again was very delicous. Unfortunately, the stuffs are a little bit disorganized and the stuff who guide you to your table are not aware which customers were first in the line, so it happened that other customers after us were served first. If you finished your plate they will directly try to get the old plates which is ok but please stop asking customer if you can have the other plate which is under your current plate while you are still eating. That's annoying and rude. Ask for empty used plates which are besode but not the one under your current plate while you are still eating. But overall it is apways a good choice toeat there.

 Check-in took forever and it was inaccurate. Booked for 1 adult and 1 child and only reflected as one adult and was told I have to pay for breakfast for my child. 

The hotel upgraded me but actually it was actually a downgrade. The Ambassador room was dated and my initial room had a double bed but was given twin beds. Beds were uncomfortable and one of the twin beds was already leaning on the side.

The elevator also had a mind of its own thus being on 18th floor did not help. On the outside of the elevator, there was no indication which direction it was going - either up or down. 

The bathtub certainly needs to be uprooted and replaced. All chipped in so many places and the temporary remedies they made kept floating whilst having a bath. Missing shower cap on amenities and had to request for this. The room was also only provided one toilet tissue so this was also again being requested. 

The room was however clean and of ample size. The view was absolutely rubbish during the day since you then overlooked some deprived areas of the area. The room lacked charging sockets too. 

Disappointing breakfast to say the least and certainly wasn't worth what they were charging. 

Check out was exactly the same as check in that took forever.

The hotel's parking area also smells and is dirty. 

Thank goodness the staff were brilliant with an exception of the Front desk / reception staff who I feel deserve more training and in my opinion were not very good at what they do. 

Overall, not coming back to this hotel and will certainly not be recommending this to family, friends and business colleagues.",0.2222222222222222

 They have great facilities including some nice restaurants, a casino, separate kids and adult pools, and the best hotel gym I have ever seen. The gym had a cross fit training area, a boxing ring and one of those air aerobics rooms where people hang from curtains. You would never know this as there is absolutely no marketing to guests at check in or in the rooms. Maybe that‚Äôs why the restaurants are empty. 
The staff was consistently gracious and super friendly. Requests for maintenance and laundry pick up were prompt and professional. 
Kudos go to the front desk manager who, unlike her colleagues, jumped in to assist when there was a long line. Also the sales department who booked one group after another, keeping the property full. Maybe they can apply their talents to some in house marketing
 What bothered me was the overall lack of management presence, supervision, and training of staff. This extended to fine dining mechanics and timing, to housekeeping details, and attention to the breakfast buffet. 
For example, there was a huge line at the egg station. If the manager checked, he would have seen that a cook who was trying to help the woman at the egg station was instead getting in her way. He kept invading her space and breaking her rhythm. If I was managing a restaurant in town I would hire that woman and double her salary without hesitation. An outstanding employee by any measure. Seeing her being disrespected that way was upsetting to watch.",0.6666666666666665

 First, as we went into the hotel we were impressed with the  entrance and the beauty of the place but as we went into the elevator, we noticed a foul musty odor. Not sure if it was the carpet with moisture or what but it smelled almost like moldy musty odor. As we we t into the room, we liked the view and the suite but odor was still in the room and it was hot and muggy in which I could not sleep. I called the front seat in which they sent an engineer up abs said there was nothing they can do as the AC was centralized and they had an issue with the AC. End of story.

 I have been going to the Waterfront for many years now whilst visiting the Philippines. What can I say? I have never once been disappointed.

Polite, happy, and friendly staff, and at least for a hotel in Cebu, amazingly quiet. Food menu is awesome.

Breakfast is exceptional. And without a doubt the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in (will need to find out who makes them one day).

Always happy to return.
