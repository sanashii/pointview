Agoda,823756808,"Me and my boyfriend booked JPark because his family went there and had a positive experience. Personally, it was going to be my first time at JPark. I saw it’s a 5 star resort and having had a negative experience in another 5 star resort, I thought I should lower my expectations. Turns out, even at my expectations lowered, JPark EXCEEDED my expectations. 

First of all, they treated us like kings. And I’m talking royalty royalty. We arrived in our Deluxe Room and saw there were no bathtubs and being a couple, we needed one. The front desk immediately offered a room exchange. They even sent someone to carry our luggage, AGAIN! 
In the new room, we have our bathtub, we are very happy and the employee that assisted us was lovely. 
Then, we realize that the water is lukewarm and coming from the slides, we needed a shower ASAP. The front desk offered a room change yet again and to our delightful surprise, we received a free upgrade. 
Jpark made us feel cared for, made us feel like we needed to expect nothing but the best from them and they outdid themselves. 
We will come back!!! Thank you JPark for making us truly disconnect and truly enjoy our vacation time.

You have to pay for everything - pool table, table tennis, mini golf, etc. food is not great and expensive. Our son had fun with the slides and lazy river. 
I got a massage which was  amazing. The masseuse was great. However, I came home with massive bed bug bites all over my body. I’m pretty sure it’s from the massage table.  I messaged the hotel to make sure they clean/sanitize - no response yet.

Agoda,802256120,"Stayed for 4 nights- couple with 3 young kids(ages 7-9) 

The good:
- Waterpark is great fun for the kids,
- Location is ideal - in the center of town - many shops and experiences around,
- AC in the room was at a steady 18C Hooray!!,
- They offer several water activities,
- Breakfast and dinner buffet are good,
- Staff is lovely,
- Drinks are delicious,
- The Coral restaurant is special - live music and good food and drinks,
- 4 restaurants to choose from or you can experience the restaurants right outside of the hotel
- The “beach” is rocky,  the kids spent a lot of time snorkeling.

The not so good:
- Room had a bit of funky smell,
- Found other’s people hair all over the room,
- Mattress was hard and pillows too soft and uncomfortable,
- Stayed in a large suite and no sofa bed in the living room area - had to pay extra $ per night for the extra bed,
- Water pressure is very weak and water suddenly stops when showering,
- AC keeps room cool but is extremely loud,- kept being awaken by the loud sounds, 
- There is a rooster in the neighborhood that woke us up from our already poor night sleep at 5:00am everyday,
- No kids club. They offer some sort of one on one babysitting for $75 per two hour session. 
- US prices for everything. Dollars are very much loved there. 

I say - Go if you have kids. They will love it.

Agoda,799093380,"""bitin"" is a term in Tagalog used when we feel like there are still so much more to enjoy but we just could not stay any longer. This is exactly how I describe our trip. Since it was an overnight stay only, there were so many more amenities we were not able to see and enjoy, especially the kids. Looking forward to our next stay, so we can time our stay better and make sure we get most of the experience we can have from this place. thanks

Agoda,798198428,"The Hotel is one of the better in the Philippines, absolute! But it is so much overpriced... We booked with 67% Discount, and still 13K a night (including a good breakfast Buffet). The Hotel is made for ""Stay Inside"". You have 5 (or more) Restaurants inside, a giant Poolside with 3 pools (one behind the J Tower). But also the pools... 1/4 of the poolside smells for diesel (because of the nightly fire show), 2/4 of the pools smells for septic tank...
But the most nagging is their Greediness! 30K for a night regular rate, and you are charged for extra 100 Pesos for using the wall plug in the business center!! 2.500 Pesos for a average Diner buffet, but you are charged for 100 Pesos extra for the Beer Tap. And at the end it is a philippino hotel: Faucets are ""flexible"", toilets out of order, seals of the bath tub let the showering water rinse down to the next flor... Overpriced. I think they don't want other Customers than Koreans, i think 90% of the guests are koreans, very nice, best hotel guests you can spend time with. And 90% of this are families with kids... sometimes loud kids. Multiply it with 100...

Rooms were big, clean, and comfortable.

Facilities inside were great and there were enough activities inside to make us happy. The beach was awesome and my 5 year old son and my wife enjoyed snorkeling near the shore. Water activities were available too inside the resort and priced reasonably. 

Easy transfer to and from the airport via Grab. Same with going to Cebu City via the new expressway.

Only thing we didn't like was the food. It was just okay. There are options outside the hotel though.

Will come back again for sure.

Agoda,578872714,"Overall had an amazing time at JPark. It’s a kids wonderland and seeing the joy on my kids faces was worth the money spent here. 

1) Room- mactan ocean view suite was large and roomy and had an amazing view. 2 bathrooms and a separate living area and bedroom area- much needed for a family of 4 for a week’s stay.  Note: for the very first night, we booked a deluxe room (cheaper) since we arrived at 3:30am. The deluxe room was not 5 star. The bathrooms looked dingy and the caulking was horrid. Hopefully all the deluxe rooms do not look like this. We were so happy to move to our mactan suite. 

2) spa - 5 star spa. I went twice to try two different packages. Highly recommend shynn. Her hands were magical. I left fully relaxed and highly recommend this spa. Gabby at front desk was also very nice and professional. 

3) food- abalone breakfast buffet- 5 star all the way. A multicultural breakfast buffet of Filipino, Korean, American, Japanese and a full pastry section. Only thing I’d recommend is to maybe have the expresso section be able to customize drinks. They make the most amazing lattes but don’t have the stuff to customize like caramel or chocolate :) special shout out to Jonathan for his amazing service.

note: we tried the coral,  Korean, Chinese, Japanese and all the pool bar food. Never had a bad experience. 

Housekeeping: very good 

Pororo cafe: nice but pricey for what it is. For the price we are paying per night, would be nice to have one free play time. 

d-thrones: the mini scooter car rentals for kids . 300 pesos for 30 minutes. So fun and worth it.

Babysitting: there are babysitters who offer care at the pool area while parents can relax. They all seem to offer different rates but it’s very affordable. Tip them well. They do a great job to actually give the parents a relaxing vacation as well . It seemed about 50 percent of the guests were aware of this service and used babysitters. 500 pesos is paid to the hotel to host them for the day at the resor

Agoda,568133156,"The staff were great - smiles and friendly attitudes all around.
We stayed in 909-B (Deluxe Ocean View).
A/C in the lifts/elevators - but as soon as the doors open for your floor - whammo! - Heat and humidity, but it's not an open air hallway, so why not turn on the visible A/C units in the ceiling? 
Though the bed was comfortable, the room needs to be renovated - dated from the 1990's and the chase lounge in the room... the foam pad is so old it doesn't fit correctly into the cover and it's very uncomfortable - Bathroom has combined bath/shower. Very narrow bath that caused both of us to have a few near accidents.  Also, the drainage around the bath is poor and they rigged up a pipe under the counter to do this, but it's clogged and ran slow.
The breakfast buffet (madhouse) is mediocre at best.  Food temps too low - eggs cold - not warm - cold.  ""Juices"" are some sort of powered mix - no signs of any bits of fruit in them.  If you want bacon ask one of the roaming chefs around the buffet - they keep it in the back to avoid the stampede.
The staff are the real reason for the success of this property - management need to bring this hotel into the 2020's.
Would we stay here again?... Perhaps, but not until the place was renovated.

We just missed it coz of the rain during our stay. Snorkling is fun, they provide lifevest for uncertain one, so just have some fun. Sadly typhoon Odeth just visited the area before us and damage not only parts of the property but the reef also, it deprive us of diving also. Maybe next time when we visited again.

The only thing that bothers me is  the streets going there. I know Cebu is very famous of her small street.. Goodness can't their LGU make a one way of this streets?  Considering the Standard it is a one lane street luckily everybody accepts the 2 way purpose. So if you don't have the nerve to ride a car in this area better leave it... I've accepted the challenge but with la lot of cursing. Don't worry! Only my passenger heard them all.

If you only stay at the resort then everything is fine.  If you want to roam around I'd rather suggest to know their public transportation network or hail a cab or grab(über).

I asked for the manager, they said maybe I can speak to the duty manager at 7pm! 

I eventually got my room, which was nice. Just shame the management seems oblivious about the first impressions of guests as he/she is missing from the action. 

I encountered other incidences such as no towels at 9am by the pool and told to come back in an hours time. And having to pay cash for facilities IN the hotel.

,955161577,"The check-in process was fast, and early check-in was allowed since it was available. The first impression of the hotel showed it looked a bit aged, but it is still in good condition and usable. The room was large, and the bathroom was spacious. However, the room lacked a welcoming vibe on the first day, which was unexpected for a 5-star hotel. The outdated carpet design and antique chairs in front of the elevators contributed to the aged appearance.

The balcony provided a relaxing view of greenery, even though it was far from the beach. kids thoroughly enjoyed the playroom and Pororo Park, although the latter was quite expensive for its medium size. The pools were big and enjoyable, and the lazy river was a highlight. The resort offers a variety of entertainment facilities such as mini-golf, a playground, an activity room, go-karts, and slides. The toddlers’ pool was particularly loved by the kids, and the Amazon River attraction was a standout feature. Various water activities are also available, adding to the fun.

Food prices were on the higher side with an average taste, but the serving sizes were acceptable. There are many nearby restaurants if you prefer dining out. The buffet breakfast was average, and the lunch buffet restaurant itself felt too expensive for the limited selection. However, the 100% natural juice was a highlight. The restaurant personnel were very professional and well-trained. Room service was available through a barcode menu only, with no printed copies, which did not attract us to dine in our room.

The pool design has areas with varying depths, so children need to be supervised carefully. The Wi-Fi was strong but unusable in the rooms, which was a significant inconvenience. It is recommended that someone from management check in for one night with an iPhone to personally experience and address the Wi-Fi issues along with any other areas needing improvement. The poolside entertainment, including Zumba, live singing, and a fire dance, was a delightful addition, and hot towels were provided after swimming.

Additional facilities such as a fitness center, spa, and gym are available, along with huge function halls. Other amenities include an ATM, casino, and photo studio. However, gift shops and necessity shops were hard to find. The presence of “no smoking” signs in the room was unusual and a bit annoying for a 5-star establishment. The staff were helpful and responsive to complaints, making efforts to address any issues seriously. Both check-in and check-out processes were fast and efficient.

,946010172,"We visited J Park as day guests and I cannot help but compare my experience to that of a day guest at the Shangri La. Firstly the price of the day pass was exorbitant. The staff at the day use desk and the guests at J Park were just so unhappy. I was actually shocked by it. We have been travelling all over the Phillipines and everyone is so friendly and happy. Not at this place! Guests look so sour, I mean you are in the Phillipines would it kill you to smile. The facilities are OK. OK pool, we opted for buffet dinner at the Abalone restaurant and the staff were attentive and the food plentiful.

,944233523,"We had a memorable staycation at Jpark. It was our baby girl's birthday and she had a marvelous time. 
As a family that loves to travel together, we have tried almost all the good beach resorts in Lapu-lapu city, Cebu. There are negative things we noticed immediately upon arriving at the resort. One, most of the areas in the resort needs maintenance and cleaning. The pools looked clean but the drains were really dirty. However, the pros to Jpark are more than enough to make your stay great! We stayed in a big room with a King bed at the new Jpark Tower. Even with a kingsize bed, chair with stool, baby cot/crib AND and extra bed the room was still very spacious. Big enough for our infant to crawl around when we stayed in the room. We are impressed with the room size however, as with the rest of the resort, it also needs maintenance. We did not have hot water for showering but its not a big deal. What the Resort have that overly compensates for its shortcomings is the CUSTOMER SERVICE and their FOOD. They have a good variety of good food with reasonable prices. We ate at our favorite Nonki and Maru restaurants and tried their chinese Ching Hai restaurant. We have breakfast at Abalone and snacks at Aquos and before we left ate at the Coral restaurant. They all have tasty and good for value foods. But the best part about this resort is their customer service. Most of their staff were accommodating and non-discriminating between foreigners and locals. However some staff were above standard and made the extra effort to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Miss Jomarie at the reception front desk made us feel welcome right from our arrival. She listened to all our requests and did all that she can to accommodate. Kevin at the infinity pool was also noteworthy. As simple as offering to help inflate our baby floaters gave us more time to enjoy playing with our kids. And before we left, Bingbong of the Abalone restaurant left an unforgetable impression to our family and made us think we want to come back just to eat at the Coral Restaurant. He and Mario gave Excellent service and Bingbong later offered the kids to a fishfeeding experience. He took our family photos with enthusiasm and when we said thank you his response was unforgettable. He said ""No, i should be the one to thank you because you chose Jpark Resort"". Amazing! 

The thing also worth mentioning is the Pororo Park.

,930254345,"I have stayed at JPark 3 times over the last 5 years. Most recently with my wife and kids.

At a high level it looks like the perfect resort to stay at with kids. The problem is the place is going downhill fast and the owners are not doing proper maintenance.

We had three rooms this weekend and all of them smelled terrible like mildew or mold or something. The kind of smell that hits you in the face when you walk in the room.

The resort clearly needs new carpet.

The TVs in the room are very small and the system it uses is ancient and not a good experience.

The WiFi was terrible. Unusable.

I went back to my room at midnight one night and couldn't get in my own room. The key card wouldn't work. I had to go to the front desk to get a new key. With amazing Filipino hospitality they even walked me back to my room to assist me. 

We then figured out about 30 minutes later that the problem was my hotel room door didn't properly close. The key card wouldn't work because the door wasn't actually locked. The only way to lock the door was to slam it hard. The door jam didn't line up. The poor guy helping me from the front desk couldn't even figure out what was wrong.

One of the best things about JPark is the nice hot shower. That is something that is hard to find in the Philippines. Sadly, the faucet in the same bathroom was leaking and needed to be replaced. Maintenance not being performed.

The pool is one thing that is functional but you can see paint fading due to lack of upkeep. The pools are excellent and probably the only reason they are in business.

The buffet is a strength for the resort but it is pretty expensive for the Philippines. It's around $30 a person. Overall the food was great.

Pororo Park is about $30 for you and all the real rides and attractions were for whatever reason closed when I was there. Basically we got a playground, trampoline, some building blocks, a water table, and slide for $30. It did keep my son busy for an hour so I still consider it a win.

There is no beach at JPark. There is some sand and then rocks in the water. Don't expect any sort of good beach experience at JPark. Go somewhere else or island hopping if you want a dream beach experience.

When we went before the D Thrones ride on cars were one of my favorite parts. Now they best summarize the entirety of JPark.

They are all broken and no longer available. The amusing part is there are still signs all over the grounds about them. They are too lazy to fix or replace them and then too lazy to at least take the signs down about them.

JPark could be a 5 star resort. Right now it is exactly O.K. and honestly only in business because it doesn't have any real competition. It's super popular for Korean tourists for some reason.

The management team needs to get it together and do proper maintenance.

,905216821,"Disappointed that this hotel was listed as a 5 star property. I will begin with the check in process. It was quick. We got our room fairly fast but I wasn’t pleased when I went for a swim & ordered a drink at the swim up bar &  my rm# & name  wasn’t given the option to do room charge as form of payment. In my wet swim suit attire I had to walk to the front desk to ask why. I was then told by the front desk receptionist that the reason why was I had to  pay a 9,000 PHP charge on our account to proceed. This wasn’t even communicated to me. And that was when my frustration grew. If we knew this we would’ve saved ourselves the embarrassment & waste of time at the pool bar. I mean after all a 5 star property would offer that experience as a courtesy, speaking of the room charge that is. It was embarrassing. The property could use a face lift at that. Including our Pool Villa. It smelled like a public toilet the whole time. I even called the front desk to have someone spray the bathroom so it wouldn’t smell like feces or a cesspool of a sewer. The decor of the pool was also a let down as some faux grass boards were missing but without it that detail showed sub par contracting work. It just screamed negligence in addition to the moss forming on the door corners. The concept of the pool villa was cool but for 5 minutes and I would honestly recommend it for 1 night only to experience a private pool. The upkeep or the feeling of this room to feel stress free & clean isn’t worth it. We ordered IRD a couple of times (we stayed from here 7/19- 7/22) and when asked a room service staff member if they could pick up the dirty dishes after we ate they told me “maybe if it’s not raining”. This is unacceptable. Another night we ordered from Nonki, the Japanese Restaurant apart of the resort and due to a private function take out was the only option. But when our family of 4 was done eating we had to put all the garbage outside of our room because we had bags worth of trash not picked up. We heard the street cats digging into the bags in the middle of the night.  
I really wanted to have a great experience here with my family however it was the opposite. I recommend not taking the pool Villa for more than 1x night. You’re better off getting a clean smelling room. Over all I’d say JPark is definitely a novelty resort for kids but don’t expect 5 star service. Expect 3.5 and you won’t be disappointed.

Restaurant food were good but like any hotel resorts, price is on the high end. I actually loved the Japanese restaurant just outside the main Jpark building.

Our booking is a package for their Mactan Suite with breakfast, spa, cocktails at the Hacana By The Bay and discounts for other amenities. Prior arrival, I made sure during reservation that a birthday set-up will be prepared in the room ( to suprise my children and make them feel special for their birthday vacation), to my suprise, as per Reservation, they do not offer such thing ( taje note, I am a hotelier mysrlf and all hotels have different birthday set-up to make guest feel special during their stay) Jpark is a 5 star waterpark resort so I guess i expected a lot. Anyway, I then just ask for a cake which i will pay,to be placed in the room before we arrive. Arrival, room is not ready due to high occupancy, so I reminded the Front office regarding the set-up i made with the Reservation. When the room is finally ready, the cake i arranged was not there. I made a follow up in their Call Center at around 3 30pm and was tild to wait for a feedback. Hours passed, no call was returned to me. We are preparing to leave to meet the family for a dinner outside the resort. Then we heard a knock and when i opened tge door, there was a delivery of a cake. I asked the waiter on who ordered the cake, he answered that it is complimentary to our room. Now im confused, the suprise cake was never arranged as agreed, the cake i followed up never got clarified for hours, now, complinentary cake? I have to discuss it with the management to clear things out. Gladly, Mr,Ryan Garcia ( Duty Manager) was there to hwar my confusion and complaints. He gave me rhe assurance that it will be discussed and investigated.  Thanks ro him our firsr visit and first night  in the resort didn't end up tragic and disappointing.
Fast forward to the rest of our stay. The kids enjoyed the slides and Amazon ricer a lot. But you must be prepared to be early even if the slides opens at 10am . Towels are already lying on the pool beds when you get there late.  Breakfast is a feast but again, you have to be prepared to line up and see a lot of people. They do have very high occupancy during our stay,especially with korean groups. The room we had waa very spacious because we booked a suite, we noticed some dirt issues in the barhroom but aside thatbthe room was comfortable enough. We also had a spa at Cara Spa which me and my husband enjoys a lot, it is an high-end facility where you will feel like a queen and king with their service and facility. 

Cuatomer Service, front office 3/5 ( lacks communication skills and empathy) , call center 2/5 (all calls i made that needed call back never happened cake, water dipper) Restaurant 5/5 (they are cery friendly and helps all guest as possible)

Overall, 3.5/5 for our entire stay, it ciuld have been worse if not for Mr. Rran. I wished we couls thank him personally but was not able to. Will we come back?

3. During the room cleaning, we are asked they first if we want the bedsheet to be changed which is I think should be automatically changed. No sweeping or vacuuming of the floor was done.

,890308387,"3rd time visiting this property and it was terrible. We used our “voucher” in the Cabanas  during the visit. When my Mom order some foods, she was decline that they can’t serve foods from other outlets and was only offered the pica2x. I was shocked since our previous visit we ordered the same foods and it was served in the cabanas. 

When I arrived, they only ordered the pica2x. So I asked one of the servers that we will order our usual foods that we like. I told them that we are in Cabana 1 and we would like to request for a staff to take our orders in the Cabana. I presumed they are busy since it is Mother’s Day today so my sister went to Abalone to order. My sister was told that they can only offer take out orders even if they are told we are staying in the Cabana. 

After 1 hour, no one approached us if the foods were ready to pick up. When I went to the towel counter thats the time I was informed that our order was ready to pick up. When I arrived in Abalone, I asked the cashier what time the foods were ready and she said it was ready 15 minutes ago. I asked them why they did not informed me and she just answered she called the towel counter but the staff there did not do anything. I asked her if they can send some glass of water in the cabana and she just said to ask one of the staff near the pool. So they can’t even assist me with my request. Where is the service here?. (They are not busy when I arrived since 80% of the tables were empty!)

When we started eating, they prepared plastic spoon and fork in the take away plastic. No plates!. What is this, Fast Food service?!. No initiative to provide us a better plates, and utensils when they know we are in the Cabana. 

They lack training. No follow through, No Initiative, and No Genuine care. To think today is Mother’s Day. I spoke to their F&B Manager and told him everything. Our previous visit was very good compared to our visit today is 1 out of 10. He insisted to give a service recovery but thats not the purpose why I requested for a manager. He was persistent so I requested for a glass of ice instead. 

Be consistent with your service. Hopefully when we visit again (IF), there is an improvement done.

,879379067,"We booked this resort as a 6-night family holiday with our 3yr old daughter.

This is a huge resort with a beautiful waterpark and quite a few things to do.

Check-in was fast and easy. The desk clerk even allowed my wife to physically see some rooms so we could choose the one that best suited our needs.

We got a 1 bedroom sea-view room that had plenty of space complete with a small balcony and an area to hang our wet swimsuits and towels.

The room was clean and well-furnished.
The kitchen area had a sink, kettle, and a countertop to eat lunch if you ordered room service.
Off to the side is a half bath, great for not having to go into the bedroom to use the toilet.

The bedroom was large with a walk-through closet and separate toilet area as well as a separate oversize bathtub and shower area.
The water pressure was excellent, so having a nice warm shower after swimming all day was comforting.

There are a few different restaurants to choose from, but be cautious as the prices on the menu won't be the same on your bill. There are added taxes and surcharges so be sure to watch out for them and inquire immediately to your server or restaurant manager.

The Coral restaurant right on the ocean is calming and has beautiful views, the perfect setting for a nice dinner. The food was of good quality as well.

The staff was ALL friendly and nice, with no issues at all.

The breakfast buffet is huge and offers a lot of different dishes and drinks.

There is a small entertainment in the evenings beside the main pool consisting of fire dancers and 2 female singers.

There are a lot of stores and restaurants outside the resort, just walk out the gate and there are all over the place.

The waterpark has areas for all ages. Since our daughter is 3, we stayed around the kiddie area where there are many slides and water activities. She also loved the river rafts, that went in a circle and had fun getting wet from all the sprinkles throughout the course.

There is a casino on the site but the minimum bet is $20usd chips.

We had a very good time and would highly recommend this to other families that are looking for a nice relaxing holiday.

,863238651,"My wife and I live in Cebu city. Our building took a hit from Odette. We have lived with construction noise for months. So we needed a getaway. I paid the most I ever have paid for a hotel in the Philippines and booked a M-F room at this hotel. The place was on the wife’s bucket list.  With my booking I sent a request for a quiet room. I got a form letter response. That annoyed me, what kind of customer service is that for a 5 star ? So I sent an e mail through the site I booked the hotel. No response. Now I was mad so I sent an e mail to the web site of J Park, no reply. Finally I sent Jason Wu’s food company an e mail to be forwarded to him telling the millionaire owner his customer service stunk. No response. When we checked in I told the woman who checked me in I tried repeatedly to get a human response to my request for a quiet room and never got a response. So I told her all I care about is a quiet room. Well we check in go to the pool come back are settling into our room and WHAM super loud disco and an obnoxiously loud MC coming from an event by the pool. My head exploded. No blackout curtains in a room that faced the sun and no soundproofing in the room.  I complained and was told initially that I was given a schedule of events when I checked in. It was not until telling the hotel manager I would have any further conversation with his superiors we were offered a room upgrade. We transferred the next day to a quiet room with blackout curtains the room had what once must have been a beautiful ocean themed rug but how would you know it was filthy. Some Five star. The towels in the room were Motel 6 quality. I mean come on a Five star with heinous towels ? The hits just kept on coming. 4 days we were there not once did the water in the shower get hot. You are a supposed Five star with a beach and pools and you have awful towels and no hot water in the bathrooms…..some Five star. My wife loved the breakfast which had great COVID protocols me ? Four days every day my eggs were cold. How do you have a hot plate a warming light and the eggs are cold ? Usually Five stars have an omelet station here no so much. Coffe which I always expect to be awesome at a five star was Folgers quality meh. Oh the food story gets better we went to the Japanese resturant by the front gate it was the only superior meal we had the wife’s fish and my sashimi and sushi were quite good. The other place Coral very hit or miss. One night we had the best nacho’s I have had since living in Cebu, but the shrimp we ordered were rubber. Last night there the wife had a very nice crab meal, my entree was served with cold vegetables. This stuff is resturant 101 how does a supposed Five star consistently serve cold or substandard food ? They charge you not cheaply for the food there are expectations involved here. So make your expectations very low for food at this place. One note from the pics it looks like a white sand beach. The beach is all rocks. You need water shoes which I did not have. I cut my foot and the bottoms of my feet hurt for days afterwards so remember your ocean slippers. All in all we got what we came for. The wife and my boy loved the water park and the sea. The grounds are lovely the staff almost too helpful. I still do not understand how there is always someone around to take my empty plate or cater to me but every time I ordered a cocktail it took 15 minutes to arrive, I needed to order my second when the first arrived, sadly I was not that smart. So remember you pay for the kIds. Me the person who has stayed at other five stars and paid the most for a hotel room in the Philippines ever ….I felt robbed. Hijacked.

They even attempted to offer us a room that was declined by the other guests. It was very insulting! They said that our room is not ready yet despite of it being pre-booked and paid. Other guests who arrived after us, (Koreans) were immediately escorted to there rooms, while we were in the lobby. While we were there 3 more guests of other nationalities went past by us. It was only when I complained that they allowed us to go to our room! That was almost 30 minutes after. 

I Was told that it's alright not to leave a security deposit and just pay for whatever services we need. Okay. 

During the night, my mom arrived and was in reception, I told the operator over the phone that I need to take a shower and will pay right after. She said okay. I thought she's sending my mom to our room. But no she didn't. I finished showering, and waited for 20 more minutes. Then i went downstairs. She didn't send my mom upstairs because I need to pay additional 2000php because i didn't leave any deposit. It's not like we can escape and leave it unpaid! We paid for an overnight stay! And while we were there a family of another nationality came and was told that they can pay later since they were staying over night. So were we!

They follow check ins very closely so if your trying to check in early be prepared to pay a 1500 peso fee. Sadly that's just the start of the upsells. Get to the room and a beautiful room and the free waters and coffee is great. Sadly our room wasn't fully cleaned and found a previous guests dirty towel behind the seat pillows on the couch. Had to wait for almost an hour for housekeeping to get.  Went to get the breakfast next am and that was a let down. If you going with any kids over 13 be prepared to pay. They only allow 2 adults and one kid under 13. Any children over 13 is a adult and you have to pay. The food was great not so much the upsell. The water park is ok but once again children get screwed out of it. The slides cannot be used by anyone under the age of 18. So that removes alot of the fun for them. Sadly only the pool is covered in your room fees. Porororo park is a separate fee to use. Any of the activities such as mini golf walking chess and the pedal bikes are all also fees. So if you are coming with family be prepared to pay alot to do things for family.,4.0,2022-08-02,0.75,jpark_island_resort_and_waterpark,went enjoy family welcome home trip havent home since covid hit decided come celebrate coming home first entrance stunning beautiful follow check in closely trying check early prepared pay peso fee sadly thats start upsells get room beautiful room free water coffee great sadly room wasnt fully cleaned found previous guest dirty towel behind seat pillow couch wait almost hour housekeeping get went get breakfast next let going kid prepared pay allow adult one kid child adult pay food great much upsell water park ok child get screwed slide used anyone age remove alot fun sadly pool covered room fee porororo park separate fee use activity mini golf walking chess pedal bike also fee coming family prepared pay alot thing family,2

,843617799,"I am a big fan of this hotel resort (back when it was called Imperial Palace) until our last stay which was just this June 2022. To be honest the only selling point of this Hotel Resort is, of course, the Waterpark. It's only good for families with kids who will surely enjoy the swimming pools and slides. These are what I notice from our recent stay:

1. The lobby and check-in area looks old. It's high time that they elevate it.

2. Abalone, their buffet restaurant, still looks old and the same from the past years we have visited it. Breakfast buffet spread were all the same each day. Mactan Shangri-la is way better with their buffet options.

3. Our room is old. We opt for 2 bedroom suite since we are 4 adults. It was a long walk from the main lobby as it it in the farthest bldg in the property (ocean view) The TV was like from the 2000s and the bath tub has alot of dirt from its hardware material. I was looking forward to have a hot tub but didnt bother to use it anymore. Fridge looks old, dining table is old, every furniture is old. What we only liked here is the view but of course it comes with a price.

4. Dont waste your time in the beach area. Until now its not as sophisticated as Movenpick and Shangri-la. Lots of big stones and the rightmost side of the area is still undeveloped.

To the property owner, do not settle for being branded only as a ""Waterpark"" its now high time that you keep up with technology and change slowly everything inside your property such as furnitures and fixtures. Guests can have best of both worlds with old stylish with a hint of modernism.

Will we ever go back? not anymore. I just find this hotel tired. Will look forward to other beach resorts with modern ambiance (maybe Dusit).

,839414112,"They claim to be a 5 Star Property, sad to say, your property is far from being 5 stars.

I was able to get the 21 day advance purchase rate for a two bedroom suite. I didn’t know that the room that will be given to me was an old and un-refurbished room. It didn’t even have bidets in either of the bathrooms. Shouldn’t bidets be basic nowadays? No microwave in the room too.

My brother in Law, who also booked the same room category for the same exact rate got a newer room with bidets and a microwave.

My kids loved the Pororo suite room. One tile by the shower area was loose already and the water drain in the shower went down very slowly. At the foot of the beds in the room, there are wooden feet of the characters of the specific bed. It’s an accident waiting to happen. You should put foam or thick padding on those wooden feet to protect kids from getting hurt. Some of the balls in the ball pit were cracked open or literally sliced in half already. I had to remove all of them to avoid my kids from getting scratched from the broken balls.

Most of the staff were well mannered and pleasant, however most of them also assumed you know how to speak bisaya. As a property claiming to be 5 stars, shouldn’t English be your primary language there?

5 stars right? FOOD should have been great!!! It is far from great! The only good food we had in the property was from the Japanese resto in the premises called Nonki. And it’s a third party resto.

Property is beautiful and really a dream destination for kids. But it is very far from being a 5 Star property.

You guys need to hire a new F&B Director and Executive Chef. Food quality is of a 2-3 star hotel. Buffet area food was cold and sloppy.

Given there are a few positive things we can highlight.

1. The resort is huge, it is very suitable to families with kids who want to go on vacation. Their water park is definitely the highlight of the resort.
2. Staff were approachable and courteous.
3. Guests have lots of activities they can try.

Now on to the not so great things that the resort can improve on.

1. The lobby of the resort has a chaotic feel to it, given that it was a weekend and still in the middle of a pandemic. As a guest my family and I felt lost during the check.in process and no one had helped us with our baggages. We had to meander in the hotel ourselves.
2. Check-in process takes a long time.
3. Rooms are outdated, not that spacious and everything you request from a bucket full of ice to a bottle of water is charged.
4. My family reserved 4 rooms altogether, with an extra bed in each room and never in my life saw an extra bed at a 5 star resort setup from the floor. It was just a literal mattress, laid flat on the floor no folding bed at that! The blanket was very thin which made it more disappointing. 
5. The amenities weren't that great either, the public restroom near the main pool was disgusting. It smelled awful and looked like it wasn't maintained well. It felt like we were at a low class pool resort.
6. The staff did their best ig, but the guest services hotline is no longer available at 9pm.
7. Breakfast service was good in a mediocre kind of way, not much variety of choice given that it was a weekend. 
8. Definitely an experience we wont be repeating, if you're a family who likes to chill then there are better resorts in the area who give better service and amenities.

 The staff was very friendly and professional. The spa was the highlight of the trip as far as adult things go. Our daughter (2yo) was having the time of her life at the pool and slides.
 The facility is not properly maintained, the pools are all cracked and need to be repainted/sealed the Jay Park Island sign is basically gone from the top of the building which makes me think that it was put together unsafely. The pororo Park was disgusting my daughter didn't mind but the water play area had so much debris the entire kids indoor experience was very unsanitary. It  was 28 USD for me to go with my daughter to Porroro Park and it was absolutely not worth it. A lot of the activities were either broken or poorly maintained. 

The check-in experience was horrible. I reserved our room with a king bed one month prior and it wasn't ready at our 3:00 p.m. check-in time they tried to ""upgrade"" us to a villa which seemed great but we were in that room for less than 5 minutes because it smelled and there was mold in the bathroom. We ended up getting the room that we actually paid for and finally checked in at about 4:20 p.m.. 

The food was terrible as far as good healthy selections go, an exception to this was the Chinese restaurant which we ate at twice, the Korean restaurant was also pretty good. Coral and the j lounge and the pool lounge restaurant all basically have the same menu and are very overpriced for what it is. I ordered tacos and my wife ordered caprese salad. The tacos were sloppy with most of it being different sauces with very little meat. The caprese salad seem to have had a pesto sauce on it that tasted like cut grass. Even when we ordered pancit, the flavor was there but the ingredients were not fresh. 

The bartenders were very slow and the entire staff seemed overwhelmed and not prepared for the amount of people that were there.

 Fantastic place for young kids. A number of swimming pools that cater for babies, toddlers and older kids with lots of pool beds that had shade. The pool bar was also great, and you could order food as well. The food options were great, there are a number of restaurant options with good food and service. Also the nighttime entertainment was excellent too. We had a great time.
 It was a bit annoying that you had to pay extra for the Pororo play area and also for the Segway cars. Also the pools probably need a bit of maintenance as some of the paint at the bottom was peeling off. The decor in the rooms was a bit dated too but that didn’t really matter as the rooms was spotless and the beds were comfortable.

 Five star hotel only in books. Destination is really managed poorly which is giving a terrible experience. i wouldn’t go back there even it was for free. The room was not clean and especially the bathroom, the pool was in a terrible and shabby condition as well as all most of the hotel’s common areas. You had to pay for almost all the hotel facilities (even for the table tennis and snooker). I reached there after 10 hours travel at 12:00 noon with my 4 year old daughter and the lady in reception asked me to pay another 500 pesos for early check in although I had informed them previously and the room was ready. Note that in my all other stays in other 5* hotels in Cebu I was never asked to pay. There is a general feeling that the hotel is abandoned and not proper care is given to keep the visitors happy and feel welcomed.

 UNFRIENDLY STAFF NEAR THE BIG SLIDE. He told us that go-pros were not allowed at all which was ok. We asked him for the direction of the lockers and he points us in the general direction where its at. He does it with a scowl though and is clearly tired of people asking him the same questions over and over again. He does see that my girlfriend was wearing a necklace and fails to tell us that too wasn't allowed. The lockers are a fair distance from the big slide so he could've mentioned it before we deposited our go-pro. When we came back to the slide, he told us we still weren't allowed to get on because of the necklace then points us to a sign with tiny letters and paragraphs telling us what we couldn't wear. Keep your signs simple. Use symbols. Hire a new guy there. If he's sick and tired of his job don't take it out on us. We got too upset to get on. Since the giant slide was the reason why I chose this resort over the others, it was disappointing that I never got on it. Never going here again.

The hotel could’ve had maybe a few more food choices for international travelers.",8.0,2022-03-19T16:10:03+07:00,0.7777777777777777,jpark_island_resort_and_waterpark,staff friendly room service great downside property fiancée mild skin reaction pool water hotel couldve maybe food choice international traveler,2

 Breakfast was good. I did not like the room, I have been to better rooms at 50% less their price. I expect at an expensive resort a better room with better view. The slides were closed including the pool that we wanted.
 Better room and better view. All pools must be open during the day.",3.0,2022-03-14T07:14:51+07:00,0.2222222222222222,jpark_island_resort_and_waterpark,breakfast good like room better room le price expect expensive resort better room better view slide closed including pool wanted better room better view pool must open day,0
