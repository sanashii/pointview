Agoda,791504757,"I had flown from Vancouver to Manila and then connecting flight to Cebu. It was a long travel day and the Fairfield Marriott was my hotel stop. The front desk staff were very professional and had me checked into my room very fast. The Lobby was immaculate and all the staff helpful. The room was just as advertised, and I was very pleased with the room arrangement . I had some travel arrangements to make and again the front desk went above and beyond  to help me get it all arranged . The restaurant and serving staff were beyond amazing. Having me seated promptly and my taking my food order  in a timely fashion.  The food was spot on and the dessert even better than I could have expected. The end of the night came and the bed was very comfortable and clean. Checking out was again a pleasure as they were prompt and efficient on getting me on my way.

 PROS: Pool area was so nice, room was great, everything was perfect. The elevator didn't take forever. I had had a very bad experience at another hotel that I initially booked, which was a scary experience for me so I came here last minute knowing that it would be quite the opposite. So thank you for helping me out here! The lunch and dinner options were super great.
 CONS: Ok this is more personal preference, so please take it as one person's opinion. I would have liked to just be called by my name and not ""ma'am"" constantly. I know this is a 5 star experience, so it is to be expected. Though I was referred to as ""ma'am"" only in the Philippines and not just at this hotel (traveled to 3 other SE Asian countries and they treated me normal) and it just felt like it created an uncomfortable divide. 

I was even asked if I preferred to be called just my name, which I said ""yes"" to and then was immediately called ""ma'am"" again by that same staff. I do not need to be treated like royalty, but again I understand that this is a 5 star hotel so it is possible many prefer that treatment here. I just think it is good to ask first for preference from guest and then actually listen to their answer.

Cook food a bit more; I had an omelet was undercooked. I did have eggs at another place in the Philippines which were also undercooked, so maybe that is normal here - not sure!

The location of this place was particularly impressive. Situated in a convenient and picturesque area, it provided easy access to local attractions, dining options, and scenic spots. We loved exploring the surroundings and found it to be the perfect base for our adventures.

Without a doubt, we will be returning to this wonderful place. It met our expectations apart, and we are already looking forward to our next visit.

 PROS: Pool area was so nice, room was great, everything was perfect. The elevator didn't take forever. I had had a very bad experience at another hotel that I initially booked, which was a scary experience for me so I came here last minute knowing that it would be quite the opposite. So thank you for helping me out here! The lunch and dinner options were super great.
 CONS: Ok this is more personal preference, so please take it as one person's opinion. I would have liked to just be called by my name and not ""ma'am"" constantly. I know this is a 5 star experience, so it is to be expected. Though I was referred to as ""ma'am"" only in the Philippines and not just at this hotel (traveled to 3 other SE Asian countries and they treated me normal) and it just felt like it created an uncomfortable divide. 

I was even asked if I preferred to be called just my name, which I said ""yes"" to and then was immediately called ""ma'am"" again by that same staff. I do not need to be treated like royalty, but again I understand that this is a 5 star hotel so it is possible many prefer that treatment here. I just think it is good to ask first for preference from guest and then actually listen to their answer.

Cook food a bit more; I had an omelet was undercooked. I did have eggs at another place in the Philippines which were also undercooked, so maybe that is normal here - not sure!
