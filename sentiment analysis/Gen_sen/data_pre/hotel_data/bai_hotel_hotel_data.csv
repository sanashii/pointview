Agoda,798121410,"The facility and female receptionist are exceptional. The issue that I have is with the receptionist, elevator and room access, first incedent I don't have elevator access, I went to the receptionist to have it fixed, but only to know when I reached my room (I got elevator access from the other customer with the same floor) there is no access also. The receptionist is not smiling also looks so suspicious even after I prove my identity. The second time I went to the reception, I went directly to the manager after 1 customer he attended to, I was waiting patiently only to find out he needs to reverify me again, I told him was already verified by the previoua receptionist and he can ask him and he told me in a bit higher tone of voice and iritated manner that he needs to reverify, so I did, then there is no apology or empathetic manner I heard from them even though I told him I went from elevator to the reception twice already and I am tired and frustrated. I even overheared him that my access is blocked. I asked him what was thr problem but he ignored my question and he just asked me who is the receptionist who attended me before. I felt really bad that I have to go through all of this. Out of frustration, tiredness and anger and also the urgent need to go to my room to do something urgent, I told them to make sure it will work or else I will come back to them in a very irated manner. So the manager went with me, I was about to tap the elevator access, he told me he already tapped it with his access, I told him i want to tap it myself and check if it is really working. Everything is good except for this and I was about to let it pass but I was not satisfied at how my experience was on this matter and I am hoping it will not happen to the other customers.

A lot of food options and you don‚Äôt have to worry if they run out of food and beverages as they are quick to replenish. I have no complaints on the taste of any food they‚Äôve served. Since I so full, I missed to try their Pani Puri,  Italian& Japanese cuisine, customizable noodle counter and other desserts. I guess something to look forward when we come back.

The pool bar on the roof is lovely, with a great view of the city.
However, they're not always the most organised- four times, our room keys malfunctioned, and once, a massage appointment was mishandled. The managers made sure that the problems were all rectified, but these things happened once too often. One of the rooms that we had showed signs of mold, but our subsequent rooms were clean. 

In other words, service isn't perfect, but the staff will make the effort. The breakfast buffet, which had a blend of Filipino, Western, Indian, Chinese and Korean dishes was fine. The concierge was also very good, and made sure our transport was well taken care of.

In short, I would still stay at bai Hotel, but I would definitely vocal about any mishap. The staff, at least will do their best to correct any problems that arise.

they have this ‚Äòincidental fee‚Äô they ask of you during check-in and it is very inconvenient if you do not have cash as it will only be refunded sixty days after checkout, if you use your card. 

they claim to be an international hotel but then the staff can‚Äôt talk in English even when we were addressing them in English, we had difficulty understanding Bisaya whenever we had any questions or requests. 

their entrance to the hotel felt like an entrance to the airport where you have to remove your belongings and pass it through a conveyor belt then you have to be searched. so, so inconvenient. felt like i was going to jail. 

housekeeping does not change the sheets everyday even though we clearly stated we wanted them changed, even when we called through their landline they still did not change the sheets when we came back. they only tidied the bed. 

they keep boasting their breakfast buffet was Cebu‚Äôs best in 2022 but damn there were barely any choices. they did not even have soda or japanese cuisine choices available. 

i was so disappointed. the only reason we stayed here is because radisson blu‚Äôs pool was out of service during our stay. and the price point between the two hotels is not far off.

Agoda,776042213,"I stayed here during a visit in Cebu  to view potential real estate investments as I am currently living abroad and lives in a different city in the Philippines.

Upon arrival to property, I was given a twin room and I checked-in ALONE. I told her I very much prefer a large bed which I also mentioned on my booking.

Now imagine if I showed up with a husband? We will be forced to sleep in 2 separate beds because the lady at the front desk was unwilling to do anything about it. No upselling provided, no options given, no nothing.... 

The lacklustre of the service experience was a let-down, not sure why though. The rooms had a lot of defects from the shower room to the poor finishing round the corners of the room. 

It later made sense to me, they wanted to make more money from the rest of their room inventory hence given out their least favorite rooms to guests booked on OTAs such as Agoda. 

So, to make use of the spare bed, I asked my real estate agent to stay with me since there's a bed I am not using, and I was forced to sleep in a smaller bed than what I originally expected to have paid for.   

As  a hotelier myself, this left a bitter taste, or maybe... I EXPECTED WAY MUCH. Nevertheless, breakfast was very good and the front-line team are amazing and were very hospitable throughout.

They would have let me waited longer if I didn't ask the reception again and again when the room will be ready while most of the other guests just could check-in straight away.
Room was clean, bathroom cleaningness could be improved though (stripes on mirror and glass surfaces looks not good). Windows dirty inside and outside. Parts of the room looked old already. Not possible to connect computer to TV (HDMI or USB-C). 
Internet was good and reliable. 
Room had a door to neighboring room where they played loud music and talked loud including noise of certain activities nobody want to hear! Not nice in this price class!
Security outside extremely rude against vaping outside the designated smoking area on the parking space where nobody else was present or bothered, the guy seemed just bored and had nothing better to do.  I am not a smoker and dont want to smell like an ash tray or inhale cigarette smoke! Smoking area terrible in general. Should have better options for guests in a hotel in this category!
Breakfast was okay though you have to walk long distances to your table and it is very crowded most of the time.
Would maybe book again but never ever a room with door to next room!
Staff is extremely friendly towards guests. Staff should have it's own service elevators though, elevators are over used already by guests, staff going in and out makes it worst.
Location is OK but can't do anything without a taxi ride. Area outside dodgy especially during night time. Beggars and hookers will bother you day and night few steps outside the hotel, not nice. Mall next to the hotel is low grade, need to take taxi to better mall. No nice restaurants or anything within walking distance.

This time I upgraded to the Bai hotel which is only slightly more expensive for a more premium experience.  Location is farther from the airport but it's conveniently located across the street from ParkMall for convenient shopping/dining/transport.  The doormen always helped with taxis and luggage.

Beds were extremely comfortable.  Food at breakfast buffet was great and huge.  Spa was nice and affordably priced (slightly more expensive than non-hotel massage services but very reasonable).  Received a free room upgrade at check in.  This will be my new Cebu hotel for anything other than a 1 night stay near the airport.

Agoda,760086836,"We were surprised about the big discount we got at Agoda, especially being able to stay in a high end place like BAI.  For the price we got it in, it was a steal.  However, we soon figured out why.  Unlike the usual / standard rooms at Bai, the ones on the 8th floor seemed to be behind the times.  There was a slight, weird smelly odor in the room (nothing anyone can do),  unlike the rooms we've stayed in so far, it seems like the rooms on this floor were not carpeted.  The pool, because they allow day use, was crowded at the time.  DO not go to the pool until sunset. Since it's on one of the top floors, there is no shade from the burning sun.  I was quite happy with the service and staff. Very excellent. The breakfast buffet was good, lots of options.  And overall we enjoyed it because we realized that the money we were spending just to do a walk-in at their buffet was close to the price that Agoda offered.  So if you think about it that way, that  it's basically just the buffet price  + a place to sleep / stay for the night, then it's a great deal.  Otherwise, you're better off booking at much nicer / more comfortable budget hotels.

Agoda,759209436,"Concerned by the increasing number of negative reviews for the initially booked hotel, I opted to cancel my reservation and chose Bai Hotel instead. Despite initially booking with the breakfast option, a system glitch led to its exclusion. Despite addressing the issue with Agoda, it remains unresolved. Agoda promised a response within 24-48 hours but closed the case without providing any information. Consequently, during check-in, an additional fee for breakfast had to be paid. Agoda's lack of partnership with the hotel seemed to hinder their ability to address the situation, preventing me from canceling and rebooking. This disappointing experience with Agoda has left me contemplating the use of their services in the future.

Turning to Bai Hotel, a 4-star establishment, it lived up to expectations. The staff exhibited professionalism, offering a top-notch greeting upon our arrival. As check-in wasn't until 3 pm, we stored our luggage and purchased breakfast vouchers, a process complicated by Agoda's limitations. Thankfully, Maria and Rose proved invaluable in securing the vouchers. Despite the inconvenience of luggage screening at the entrance, the lobby left a lasting impression. Exploring the hotel before check-in, we glimpsed the steakhouse and sushi restaurant.

The room, boasting cleanliness, provided a scenic view of Mactan Island. An evening visit to the 21st floor, where the pool and restaurant were located, revealed an outstanding view. While the pool restaurant's drinks were satisfactory, the appetizers were underwhelming, both in portion size and cost. I strongly advise against ordering Beef Salpicao.

On a brighter note, the buffet breakfast the following day was a positive experience, featuring an impressive array of international dishes. Although lacking in specialties, the variety and quality of the offerings were commendable. With two more nights ahead, I anticipate the remainder of our stay will be enjoyable, despite the early check-out time of 11 am.

While I would love to consider staying here again, the unresolved breakfast issue with Agoda and their system glitch pose a hurdle. If Agoda can address these concerns and enhance their customer care, I would be more inclined to book through them for future stays at Bai Hotel. However, the absence of communication from Agoda regarding the breakfast issue casts doubt on the feasibility of future bookings through their platform.

Hotel staff were very polite and always ready to greet you with a smile.

Gym was great and the breakfast buffet had so much selection. 
The location was right near a shopping mall but it was not nice to go outside as the air smelt so bad. 
We dined in the Ume restaurant which the food was decent but the service was extremely slow, even for drinks. But I guess you are pretty stuck unless you were to get a taxi anywhere else. The same was across the other venues such as Twilight. 

Disadvantage is that drinking water was not provided even in the restaurants. All of the other places I‚Äôve stayed in the Phillipines so far had drinking water filters on every floor. 

Also sadly missed out on the breakfast on the second day due to an early flight and it was not a possibility for me to pay for extra to put this towards a buffet dinner the night before.

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted with warm smiles and a level of courtesy that set the tone for our entire stay. The staff at BAI Hotel are not only professional but also genuinely friendly and accommodating. They go above and beyond to ensure that guests have a memorable and comfortable stay. What impressed me the most was that they never once said no to any of our requests. Whether it was arranging transportation, providing recommendations for local attractions, or accommodating special dietary needs, they always found a way to make it happen.

The hotel itself is a masterpiece of design and architecture. The moment you step into the lobby, you are greeted by a stunning blend of modern elegance and Filipino culture. The attention to detail in the interior decor is remarkable. The rooms are spacious, well-appointed, and offer breathtaking views of the city or the sea, depending on your preference. The cleanliness and overall maintenance of the property were impeccable.

One of the standout features of BAI Hotel is the dining options. The restaurants on-site serve a wide range of culinary delights, from local Filipino cuisine to international dishes, all prepared with precision and flavor. The breakfast buffet was a particular highlight, offering a diverse selection of fresh and delicious options to start your day.

The hotel's amenities, including the pool and fitness center, are top-notch, ensuring that guests have plenty of ways to relax and unwind during their stay. Additionally, the hotel's location in Mandaue is convenient, with easy access to nearby attractions and transportation hubs.

The amenities were also great and very also well maintained.

This is easily a 5-star hotel, but less than the price that you would you pay at a 5-star hotel.

Agoda,689728479,"Bai Hotel is a nice hotel, clean and affordable. Our stay was comfortable however I was dismayed with Agoda. I strongly recommend to BOOK DIRECTLY WITH THE HOTEL'S WEBSITE AND NOT THRU AGODA. On my last online booking with Agoda, I feel I was scammed. I booked for 2 nights stay for two persons hence I requested for twin beds. I paid 12K plus in pesos (with free breakfast for 1 PAX ONLY!) while the price in the hotel is only around 4800 per night or 9K plus only for 2 nights and with free breakfast for two persons already. SO I STRONGLY RECOMMEND TO BOOK DIRECTLY AT THE HOTEL AND NOT THRU AGODA. Because of this experience, probably we will choose another hotel to stay. Bai Hotel should warn Agoda for overpricing since its their hotel's business or reputation will be tarnished. That's our experience.

The rooms were spacious, clean, fresh towels upon request, and super friendly and gracious staff.  We ordered room service, had breakfast at the restaurant in the lobby, lunch by the rooftop pool and throughout it all we had good food and good service.  The staff made sure we were taken care of.  Kudos to the staff at the rooftop patio for taking care of a nice evening out without the kids! We had so much fun! Would definitely go back again.

Agoda,656336928,"They were generous enough to allow us to check in earlier than 3pm since they have an available room na. The room was clean, staff were nice especially the housekeeping ladies who kept on greeting us or smiling at us whenever we glance at them. I understand na Cebuano/Bisaya dialect is being used sa hotel, but I'd appreciate if staff would ask (like reception, phone operator, dining staff) if we know Bisaya or we're comfortable with Tagalog or English. I had to say, ""Sorry I don't know how to speak Bisaya"", and had to ask them to repeat what they're saying in Tagalog/English. Bed was soft and you know that the aircon's air was okay. We had work before our flight so we were surprised that we slept through the day and woke up at 12am. Such a shame that I wasn't able to use their gym nor the pool. Breakfast buffet -- Taho with the waiter in a costume is amusing. I was also surprised na may champorado, banana bread, and different bread loaves, which is very seldom with hotel buffets. I would love if we could interact with the chefs like sa Omelette station, parang may window and di ako sanay. I know na may process but I prefer na makita ko din how it's being cooked. I ended up just getting the ham and cheese omelette which was already cooked and placed in the chaffing dish. I just wish there were more dried fish, squid, or mangoes since Cebu is famous for these. There was an incident as well and the staff was quick to assist us, and had us compensated too. We were not travelers whose fond of complaining but we felt the urge to raise our concern and we were glad it was handled professionally and discreetly. Only room for improvement maybe is the bidet -- lol the pressure was way too high it felt like certain parts of us would be ripped. üòÖ We ended up not using it. Overall, we enjoyed sleeping at Bai and would still stay here whenever we're in the city.

Check in took a grand total of 30 minutes despite only 2 others before us. It was slow. Staff encouraged us to provide cash of 2000 PHP for deposit instead of charging to card, stressing that it takes I think up to 15 days? for refund.

Agoda,630310289,"Booked as it was recommended by my friend, initially it's not my hotel choice but I just gave it a try. Here what happened though.

My room changed 3x. Lack of  staff communication and request for city view  during booking if not you will be seeing cargo containers during your stay ( harbour view as advertised). 

Room is spacious and safety is the top priority (undergo scanner before entry), only positive during my stay. It's worth it if you will just stay in the hotel most of the time, however if you're out daily and just use it to sleep and rest it's not so worth it anymore ( considered expensive for a solo traveller and compared to other hotels in the city).  Stayed 4D3N and mostly I'm outside ( day tour). On my 2nd day, since I'm a bit sensitive with drinking water (hotel provided:nature's spring), I need to order online different brand of water (7liters) and other necessities. The driver was not allowed to enter even at the lobby or entrance door at least, I need to pick up my delivery items outside (near the main street) which is really inconvenient and difficult most especially it's heavy (my reason ordering online so I won't carry it too long since I'm having back pain). Nobody offered to help me out and staffs are just watching me, entrance staff did not open the main door even he saw me carrying heavy things, I just hope at least he can open it as I don't expect him to help me carry. I'm really disappointed on that time. I don't expect them to carry it for me since it's my things but at least have the act of initiative to offer help (just opening the door for me to go in since my hands are full is already a big help).

Caution ‚ö†Ô∏è: Worst bathroom/toilet floors I have seen in my life: very slippery ( dangerous! High fall risk).

Otherwise, has a good view at the top floor bar area but need to use stairs going up. Not sure if they have lift for PWD.

Btw, don't forget to bring cash or credit card with you as you needed to deposit php 8000(check in). They don

- after having taken just a normal shower, the mirror in the bathroom was full of condense.  A modern 5-star hotel should have heated mirrors

I wish that they would clean the windows and glass wall by the infinity pool. I had a spectacular view from my room, but I couldn't take any photos since the windows are so dirty.  Location is nice since it had a mall adjacent to it, but otherwise, anything else 'Cebu' will require a Grab or taxi ride.  Staff could also be trained in being problem-solvers and resourceful. Default response is often 'sorry sir, we're out' or 'we can't ' or 'I don't know' or 'sorry this is the way we've been doing it'. Otherwise a great stay.

One, food delivery riders are only allowed at the parking lot designated to them. We needed to walk and pick up our food from there. Two; hotel trollies can only service you within the hotel lobby to any floors. They can't go down to the basement parking or parking lot area around the hotel. So, if you are parked at the basement, you need to take the stairs or the elevator yourself and drive your car up outside the lobby.

Agoda,567874197,"Maybe it's just me, but I think this is a favored hotel for foreigners and csw's. They're teeming in the lobby, the buffet restaurant, and at the elevator entrance/exits. There are a lot of ofw's as well, with their family coming to fetch them. It is understandable as it is near the airport, the price is reasonable especially if there's a promo, and it also includes a buffet breakfast with the rate. Security is top notch as xray being done for everyone who enters the main lobby. Elevator will only work with your own room card. Plenty of choices for buffet breakfast with one station devoted mainly to SK tourist or long term cebu staying SK. There are a lot of them here as well. Parkmall just across the road offers lots of foid choices if you don't want to eat at the hotel. Poolbar and pool at the top of the hotel was nice, although always full. Daily housekeeping makes up the room and makes one stay comfortable. TV's audio is maxed at vol 25, so you can't disturb other guests. Always ask to be placed at the high floors and away from the elevator.

Agoda,538408442,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well. 

Departure was fairly smooth, though.

Refrigerator chilled beer is not cold enough in this climate.

My sole disappointment was their buffet breakfast for which I had to pay P500.00 since my booking did not include this. It was more of the choice (or lack thereof). They try to be international but it's like the same chicken pieces in different sauces. Where's the bacon? Is this not a standard in buffet breakfasts? The egg chef was hidden at the back, away from the main buffet corridor. This badly needs an improvement considering the type of hotel they are.

,957328485,"I hate to say but our recent stay was quite disappointing. We have been choosing this hotel for the past five years, consistently booking the same one-bedroom executive suite at approximately $180 per night. At this rate, we expect excellent service. Unfortunately, my fianc√© and I were very dissatisfied this time.
Compared to our previous stays, numerous aspects have declined, including the breakfast experience. While I understand the increase in guests, it is disheartening that they no longer serve water or coffee at the table. Instead, we had to walk to the refreshment station for a single glass of water. There were no placemats, and it was challenging to find staff for assistance. Such basic courtesies are typically upheld even by smaller hotels. After that, we avoided the breakfast buffet for the remainder of our stay, opting to order from our room instead, which felt both sad and wasteful.
Also, the lounge's alcohol selection was subpar, much to my fianc√©'s displeasure, and the food choices were minimal and repetitive.

We stayed for four nights and aimed to salvage the rest of our trip. Fortunately, the food was excellent, especially the Indian cuisine. Kudos to the chef for the authentic taste! The roof deck bar was a highlight, with attentive and entertaining staff, particularly Rica and Jennecil. Maira, Kent, and Aris were also very accommodating to my friends. Despite the overall disappointment, their hospitality made our time enjoyable.
Special thanks to Janry, Marden, and Don from the lounge for ensuring we received the service we needed. Their efforts were the main reason our stay was tolerable. But after this experience, we're not sure if we'll come back. It's sad, given our years of loyalty, but we hope things improve in the future.",3.0,2024-06-30,0.5,bai_hotel,hate say recent stay quite disappointing choosing hotel past five year consistently booking onebedroom executive suite approximately per night rate expect excellent service unfortunately fianc√© dissatisfied time compared previous stay numerous aspect declined including breakfast experience understand increase guest disheartening longer serve water coffee table instead walk refreshment station single glass water placemats challenging find staff assistance basic courtesy typically upheld even smaller hotel avoided breakfast buffet remainder stay opting order room instead felt sad wasteful also lounge alcohol selection subpar much fianc√©s displeasure food choice minimal repetitive stayed four night aimed salvage rest trip fortunately food excellent especially indian cuisine kudos chef authentic taste roof deck bar highlight attentive entertaining staff particularly rica jennecil maira kent aris also accommodating friend despite overall disappointment hospitality made time enjoyable special thanks janry marden lounge ensuring received service needed effort main reason stay tolerable experience sure well come back sad given year loyalty hope thing improve future,1

Apple provided my mom with different recommendations so my mom didn‚Äôt have to walk to the line (she is 90 years old). They both treated my mom with care, respect and compassion. This is the reason why we will be back and will tell all of our friends and family to stay at the Bai Hotel Cebu. Thank you to Marcel and Jenn who always stops and chats with us and makes sure my mom is getting all the food she wants. 
Now off to enjoy the fantastic pool. Don‚Äôt miss experiencing the Bai Hotel Cebu. It will give you hope that there are people who care. All we want is for my mom to enjoy and the staff at Bai Cebu has succeeded.

,949955287,"I‚Äôve been traveling around the world for well over 50 years. Whether it be North America, South America, Asia, Australia, or Europe I have never found a more welcoming hotel than the bai Hotel in Cebu. The accommodations were incredible. Where do I start?  The room/bed was so comfortable with luxurious sheets and pillows, the A/C was top notch and easily controllable, the TV was huge and crystal clear, the complimentary water restocked everyday, turn down bedding with snacks, and the most wonderful rain shower ever. The rooftop pool was a delight and the bar with food service is incredibly delicious. The prices for everything were more than fair and for a New Yorker like myself cheap. I must stop and take a moment to comment on the breakfast buffet which whenever possible I opt for. If you do stay here I highly recommended you include this when you book. I once stayed at a hotel in Iceland which I thought was a phenomenal buffet breakfast until I came to the bai. My words cannot do it justice so you can take my word for it (or not) but I challenge you to find one better. I know you won‚Äôt. If I have the opportunity I‚Äôll post some pics of the breakfast here. But the over all best part of our six night stay were the staff. Everyone from the checkin desk to checking out was the most helpful people I ever came across. Their service was fast and courteous. Everyone couldn‚Äôt have been better. I could go on and on about the fantastic stay we had at the bai but if you‚Äôve read this far you get the idea.

,947553416,"Bai Hotel was nice, and I would definitely stay there again. I chose it as it is close to the airport for a late arrival and early departure a few days later. The taxi rides were both quick and under 200php. 
The room was clean (although a few hairs in the bathroom) and well-equipped. The bed was quite hard but the bedding was very comfortable, so I slept really well.  Toiletries were provided but in large containers.  Robes were available upon request and slippers were in the room.  I especially appreciated the loofa to scrub away the sun cream. Two water bottles were provided daily.
The Park Mall had a small grocery but otherwise was very underwhelming. However it was a very short taxi trip to Alaya Mall. 
The rooftop was nice for city views and a cocktail. I had a pizza at the restaurant after asking if I could take half away for the morning.

,935447544,"During my five-night stay at the hotel, I encountered numerous issues that significantly detracted from the overall experience. The trouble began during check-in when the receptionist, Marjorie, claimed that none of my pre-noted requests for a Harbor View Room on a higher level could be accommodated due to apparent lack of availability. Despite my prior communication and assurance from a representative, Marjorie only fulfilled my request when I expressed frustration in front of other waiting guests.

The problems continued during check-out, where a pre-arranged late check-out was seemingly disregarded. Despite confirming a late departure and agreeing to associated charges, the housekeeping staff interrupted my rest at 11 am, insisting on a 12 pm check-out. To exacerbate matters, upon returning from lunch at 1 pm, I discovered that my room key cards had been deactivated, preventing access despite notifying the front desk of a planned 3 pm check-out.

These incidents collectively indicate a disorganized check-in/check-out process, poor communication within the staff, and an overall lack of coordination.

,931254281,"Being a hotelier for the last 10 years driving guest experience, i do have an understanding of how a hotel operates. I just checked in with Nina, friendly yet she lacked many aspects of what Hoteliers should do but for some reason I understand, I booked through Agoda, a deluxe room for two with a request for a large bed. Upon arrival I was told there was no request, and yet when I told her I requested for a large bed, she proceeded and said - it's subject to availability. Unfortunately, hotels gives the lowest category to their guests booked thru OTAs. But on many occasions, hotels do find ways. 

Now, here's what Nina failed to do 1/Apologize that I am unhappy with room choice I am getting because accordingly that's what's available 2/Offer alternatives such as combine the twin bed! It takes 5minutes for a room attendant to do this change 3/offer a paid upgrade for a higher room category 4/inform me of the hotel facilities, she didn't even mention where breakfast is but has reminded me that since I have deposit everything will be billed to the roon 5/to make matters worst, she ended my check in wishing me to ""enjoy your stay"" which I clearly won't.

I would have settled for this room if I felt cared for, some level of empathy or some lip service that if a room with large bed will be available she would inform me so a room move could be made, also offer me some options etc. So much for expecting a hotel in the heart of cebu to deliver. Or maybe, I should have lowered my expectations or better just stayed elsewhere.

,930526697,"Receptionists at check in and check out were friendly, talkative, and welcoming. The room is spacious, clean, with a great view. Everything was going quite smoothly until we went for breakfast. We called ahead the night before to inquire about protocols for bringing guests. We were informed about the charges. When we asked about the possibility of reserving a table, we were told tables are on a first come first served basis. When we arrived to the buffet, we picked a free table with no ""occupied"" sign on it for our party. The hostess insisted the table is occupied even though there were no signs on it that say it is. We kept asking where are the guests that are seated at the table, instead of answering us the hostess decided to put the ""occupied"" sign on the table right in front of us. To avoid further arguments, we found 2 separate tables nearby and asked if they could be put together so we have one large table. About 4 staff members stared at each other instead or assisting us, leaving us no choice but to move the tables and add chairs ourselves. This whole encounter made us and our guests feel unwelcome and the way the staff handled the situation was disappointing. 
Once we got the tables together, we went to the buffet, where the cherry on top of this disastrous experience was found. At the tea selection and coffee station, there was a cockroach roaming around freely. I fled the premise and went back to my table, no food in hand. I found another cockroach roaming on the floor around our table. I lost my appetite wondering about the cleanliness of the food and whether or not the kitchen is infested with more cockroaches. When we left the premise, I checked the table we originally wanted, only to find that it remained empty, with the solitary occupied sign on it. This was very disappointing, if tables are indeed first come first served, then why was this table reserved the whole time for guests that never showed up?

Overall, the diversity of the food at the buffet was met by equally diverse disappointments of unprofessionalism and lack of proper sanitation.

,930494516,"Overall, I must say that the staff at the hotel were very nice and accommodating. They were always ready to assist with any inquiries or requests I had during my stay.

However, I must express my disappointment regarding a couple of issues I encountered. Firstly, there was a persistent moldy smell in the floor hallway, which was quite unpleasant. It made me feel uncomfortable and concerned about the general cleanliness of the hotel.

Additionally, the air conditioning in my room was extremely loud, making it difficult to have a peaceful and relaxing night's sleep. The constant noise was quite bothersome and affected my overall experience at the hotel.

On a more positive note, I found the breakfast buffet to be quite enjoyable. There was a good selection of food available, and I appreciated the variety of options to choose from. It was a pleasant start to the day.

Unfortunately, my stay took a turn for the worse when I woke up with insect bites that resembled bed bug bites. Naturally, I was alarmed and immediately went to the management to request a thorough checking of my room. I expressed my concern about the possibility of my belongings getting infested if there were indeed bed bugs present. The management conducted an inspection, but they confirmed that they couldn't find any evidence of bed bugs.

While I am relieved that there were no bed bugs, I must admit that I am quite upset about the itchy bites I experienced. It has affected my overall satisfaction with my stay at Bai Hotel and left me feeling saddened by the whole ordeal.

 On the second night we went to the ""Marble and Grain"" the steakhouse, and my girlfriends birthday. Roy was there and I can only assume he let the staff know about us. The Head chef came out and spoke with us, talked about our steaks and sauces, laughed and joked with us as they all did.

Modern amenities adaptable to both locals and foreigners is great and I highly recommend. Also just across Parkmall so that‚Äôs a plus. 

Mum and I both having hospitality background have a special eye for what we know is good service, and no there are no words to express how much they go beyond that. Our room was clean and comfortable and the attention to detail and fast service is rare to come by so if quality service is what you‚Äôre looking for and inevitably more, Bai Hotel doesn‚Äôt disappoint as they tick every box. 

Extending my special gratitude and appreciation to Ray‚Äôs compassion at midnight over the phone who helped get my booking all in order before arrival. Gian‚Äôs warm and kind welcome upon check in were outstanding, even went to go out of his way to check how everything was in the room once we‚Äôve settled was unexpected but it was another cherry on top. The porter‚Äôs which I didn‚Äôt get their names should never be left unappreciated as their strong and lively aid is what makes the first impression worth while - purely stunning. Archie‚Äôs politeness and considerate source of info in the cafe made it concrete that it was good to be back home again. Thanks to Khino‚Äôs lovely assistance at the front desk for attending a request I had so quickly even though it wasn‚Äôt urgent whatsoever - grand top to bottom and all round.

,908189533,"The best thing about using Bai Hotel as a venue for official functions is the Banquet Service and Facilities, and Cafe Bai Service and Food. The front office and the rooms are a different story. They‚Äôll need to improve the tangibles and the service in order to merit thumbs up. 
The Banquet Facilities are good. Spacious and cool. Well set-up. With great technical support from engineering (special mention Marlon - he is technically competent, pleasant, prompt). Banquet Service is excellent. The service team is punctual, courteous, pleasant, personable and responsive. Special mention must be made of Quin, Edmar and Clark. They anticipate what you need, they are fast. They give Bai a very good name. They MUST be recognized and commended internally!
Cafe Bai food is hands down the BEST! The quality is great! The variety is great! And most of all, the F&B staff do their job Very Well! Maricel Newman leads them very well! She is experienced and sets a very good example. The rest of her team is equally as good! Rowel, Rachel, Lenie - they all have smiling welcome expressions consistently, they serve very well. Like the banquet staff, they are swift, responsive and they anticipate and think of what you need even before you ask. They MUST be recognized and commended internally as well!
The front office and the rooms division - they have a lot of work to do to catch up. The front office (next to the guards and bellman) is the first encounter you have with the hotel. And unfortunately, they‚Äôre not consistently good. Sometimes you meet someone who‚Äôs competent and who knows his/her job, most of the time you are handled by personnel who give the vibe of being unsure. They‚Äôre not sharp nor fast. You‚Äôll need to wait your turn most of the time. Their turnaround time could be faster. As for the rooms? Very inconsistent. You get rooms that are ok. They give you welcome pastries or drinks, you are welcomed with your name on the screen and in cards addressed to you personally, you have complete amenities and everything works. But at other times (this last trip was one for the books!), you get a really bad experience: no more welcome pastries (they call the next day and say sorry they forgot) AND the TV doesn‚Äôt work (housekeeping looks at it, is helpless, so calls IT and IT fixes it - supposedly! - and assures you it‚Äôs ok, and then it bogs down again). They transfer you to another room (because you repeatedly complain) - but in that next room, you face a TV that works tbf (but it uses ‚ÄúGreek‚Äù and hieroglyphics for you to understand how it works - it‚Äôs customer unfriendly! - they acknowledge and explain that they upgraded the TV but still use the old remote so it‚Äôs hard to use). The new room you‚Äôre transferred to does not have hot water (faucet on the sink) and is dirty (the housekeeping did not see the dirt (a used plastic they must have overlooked below the mirror near the sink). The door jamb is also stuck all the time. The pillows are not as soft. Sigh. The duty manager comes to you and apologizes profusely and does what he can to pacify you. The question is: why put yourself in a position where an apology is needed? If the front office and rooms division can look into their tangibles and can do their job as well as F&B does, they‚Äôll definitely merit two thumbs up and more.",3.0,2023-08-06,0.5,bai_hotel,best thing using bai hotel venue official function banquet service facility cafe bai service food front office room different story theyll need improve tangibles service order merit thumb banquet facility good spacious cool well setup great technical support engineering special mention marlon technically competent pleasant prompt banquet service excellent service team punctual courteous pleasant personable responsive special mention must made quin edmar clark anticipate need fast give bai good name must recognized commended internally cafe bai food hand best quality great variety great fb staff job well maricel newman lead well experienced set good example rest team equally good rowel rachel lenie smiling welcome expression consistently serve well like banquet staff swift responsive anticipate think need even ask must recognized commended internally well front office room division lot work catch front office next guard bellman first encounter hotel unfortunately theyre consistently good sometimes meet someone who competent know hisher job time handled personnel give vibe unsure theyre sharp fast youll need wait turn time turnaround time could faster room inconsistent get room ok give welcome pastry drink welcomed name screen card addressed personally complete amenity everything work time last trip one book get really bad experience welcome pastry call next day say sorry forgot tv doesnt work housekeeping look helpless call fix supposedly assures ok bog transfer another room repeatedly complain next room face tv work tbf us greek hieroglyphic understand work customer unfriendly acknowledge explain upgraded tv still use old remote hard use new room youre transferred hot water faucet sink dirty housekeeping see dirt used plastic must overlooked mirror near sink door jamb also stuck time pillow soft sigh duty manager come apologizes profusely pacify question put position apology needed front office room division look tangibles job well fb theyll definitely merit two thumb,1

The concierge are very welcoming and the ladies with teal long gown assisted me going to check-in counter and entertained my son.
I had no reservation, Venus happily assisted me.

My first room was on the lower floor with no view, and you could hear families walking by. After few minutes someone from the customer service called to check on me, told her my concerns: I have senior citizen mother coming late evening and the room is small plus no view at all, Venus immediately responded and assisted me for room transfer. I was upgraded to the top floor, which was the suite, and a very comfy-accessible room for my mom because its near lift and I got an ocean-view room. The room was very quiet, and enjoyed watching the sunset.

The buffet restaurant had a fantastic breakfast. We used the spa for massages which were top-notch. Once you get to this hotel, there is no need to go anywhere for the rest of your vacation or business trip.

Lastly, would like to give a tap on the back of all your staff esp. the hotel manager for a job well-done! Everything is well managed and organised. We can really see they trained and choose their staff well. Keep up your outstanding and phenomenal customer service ever.

We had an issue with our sink but it was immediately handled by Mr. Barriga from housekeeping. Mr. Barriga and his housekeeping team also made sure that we had everything we needed during our stay. 

The King size bed has great fit/quality for foreigners or taller people. 

The breakfast buffet has a lot of choices and always fully stocked and not to mentioned, tasty. 

We tried the Marble and Grains restaurant, the servers were very attentive but a few issues overall. 1. The cheese and meat boards took over 30 mins and was served later after we had our soup (it was disappointing) the rest of the meal was great. 
It's a nice restaurant but some guests are so rude to have their phone blasting on loud speaker while dining not everyone wants to hear somebody else's conversation. 

Also visited the Twilight bar, our server Almar was great. We had some questions about the place and the surrounding properties and he answer it all politely more like we are talking to a friend.

- concierge is superb and attentive -- one of them even remembered the taxi company we used the first 2 days even with the weekend guest influx that they had - mind blowing in a great way!
- must hangout at the pool bar --- I enjoyed the view and the food/drink service provided
- one of the best halo-halo (especially the leche flan and ube) I've tasted since I've been in the country for almost 2 weeks.
- bed was a little too firm but the pillows were comfortable that suprisingly I didn't have any neck/back aches after waking up.

Cons:
- the dressed up lady greeters are more attentive and bubbly IF you are a guy and looks more foreigner... ü§£
- no welcome drink or complimentary water or coffee in the lobby even if you're in a long wait for check-in.
- there's a baby cockroach in my room ü§Æ my 1st night

The service then was as it was during our recent stay- we were so glad to be able to enjoy the big room together this time. 

The staff are all very friendly and I have to mention how one of them went out of his way to make sure I got to the airport on time despite the ridiculous traffic (the bridge to the airport was closed that morning due to an accident), who had my bags brought to the check-in counter while I had gone ahead sprinting to the counter. It was also my birthday and instead of being a very lonely one, they gave me a cake. 

Then, and during this recent visit,  the staff were very friendly and attentive. 

We missed the mad scramble for the breakfast buffet by going as late as we could (past 9am). 

Unfortunately we weren't able to check out their facilities. I had a ramen lunch at Ume and it was served as fast as I requested.

You can see wallpapers have yellowish spots, bathroom ceiling which indicates mold is under it and on tiles. Very bad for your health especially if you consider to stay more than a night 
- No spa. I asked if there is spa, staff guided that there is so I made a reservation. However apparently there is no spa, and therapist comes to room. Cancelled because did not want oily sheets and neck aching after having massage in pillow.

,871956918,"One night stay at a junior suite. Room was quite nice overall. The room had four distinct areas - a living area, small utility kitchen, the bedroom proper and the toilet. Interior design was contemporary and generally pleasing to the eye. The bathroom was probably my least favorite space because it‚Äôs tiny compared to the rest of the room. I would have gladly accepted a smaller utility kitchen for a larger bathroom. Everything in the room worked. I had two TVs, one in the living area, the other in the bedroom. Both were HD (at least), sufficiently large and up to date. The bed was king sized. The mattress was firm but not hard. There was little in the way of stationary or pens in the room though and I couldn‚Äôt get the WiFi to work. However, I didn‚Äôt call it in.

For a nice little touch, J received a welcome pastry from the hotel. The pastry was only okay.

The breakfast buffet looked good. However, because the space got so full and crowded so quickly, I sort of lost my appetite. I dislike eating in a zoo like atmosphere. Of the viands I tried, they were only okay. Had breakfast been more relaxed, maybe I would have enjoyed it more.

Location wise, the hotel is located  in a gentrifying area of Mandaue. There is a shopping area across the street but nothing much else. The decrepit convention center is also right across.

Some positives are that the location is in walking distance to both Parkmall & City Times Square where there are restaurants and resto bars. The rooftop bar is a great experience, especially for the view and the attentive staff. However, on occasion the band or DJ are just very loud, which takes away from a pleasant dining experience. The Pool Bar was also worth a snack and drink and only one level down from the rooftop bar. 

This past overnight stay was made very pleasant mostly due to the staff, especially Chai at the front desk, Guia & Rechelle in the lobby, assisting with check-in and check-out and other guest needs, and also Duty Mgr Johanne.

Pros:
Room service was quick and delish 
Taxis and transport are easy to catch 

Cons:

at the entrance you are required to walk through a metal detector and have your bags scan through X-ray. 

No water fill stations so you are required to continuously use plastic water bottles 

Secondly they will allow no outside drink or food if not purchased from around the resort.

Over-all, I got the impression that the hotel was not being maintained well.  The carpeting in the corridors leading to my room was musty and needed a good shampooing.  My room was spacious and the bathroom was clean. The sitting areas along the corridors were a bit dusty.  

Cafe Bai breakfast buffet offered a lot of dishes, but were quite average.  The cheese and cold cuts selection was pathetic.  I would rather have a limited yet well curated good quality dishes rather than an extensive selection of bad to average food offerings.  Because of the quality of the breakfast, I opted not to do Cafe Bai for dinner, despite of the reasonable rates.

,856509482,"I stayed at bai Hotel on a layover. I've heard much about this hotel from friends and wanted to try it out for myself. 

Entrance-wise, bai's concierge guy was friendly and swift. However, guests might find it a bit jarring to go through the next step of walking through a security scan, airport style. I have not really seen anything like this in other hotels in the Philippines. 

Past that, the people behind the front desk quickly whisked us through the check-in, including a list of facilities to use. 

The room was pretty standard in terms of international stays. It was spacious. First impression was that it smelled a bit musty but that could be due to the rainy season. Beds and pillows were of the right firmness. Nothing much to enjoy on the TV. Plenty of electrical outlets. Air conditioning was loud (too loud for me) and there was no way to change the settings. Bathroom was great... except for the fact that the water pressure was so strong that water spilled over the bowl and onto the floor each time I flushed. That was a bit unpleasant and gross. 

Breakfast was a bit over the top, for me. There was too much on offer, too many people packed in a fairly small room. The arrangement of dishes and the overall journey was ridiculously confusing and the ropes and poles made things worse because customers never followed a set clockwise order. To be honest, they could have focused on a few good things rather than offer a smorgasbord of dishes that didn't really stand out. The Japanese section was not the best... for example, the chawanmushi was flavorless and overcooked. The egg dishes, in particular, were not really done well.

It is ideally located. The food is delicious and the restaurants are excellent, the staff is extremely kind and ready to do anything to make you happy. But this time we were really disappointed with the condition of the rooms. They smell of humidity, black stains of humidity everywhere, not very clean, stains of dirt we even had a visit from a cockroach. The television system is also a little faulty. The other negative point is the accounting of expenses.
We had made a deposit of 6000 pesos by credit card but at the roof top they refused to put the bill on my room because I had supposedly not made a deposit. When I went to reception, they confirmed my deposit and they told me that they had to investigate, I never heard back from this investigation...
In short, it is very high time to renovate the rooms, it is good to be very strict on safety and on protective measures against covid-19, but not at the expense of the cleanliness of the rooms.

,840144691,"I've been here about 6 days. Everything is great about this hotel except for two big things. It is basically a 4-star hotel in every way imaginable but has 1-star hotel beds and 1-star hotel internet. If it weren't for the phenomenal, consistent & superb customer service rendered by Medardo on a daily basis I would have long been gone to a hotel that has better stable wifi connectivity & much better beds. The internet crashes a lot and you spend a lot of time looking at a spinning cursor which it absolutely ridiculous for a hotel that is great in every way besides what appears to resemble dial-up speeds and connectivity regardless of what the numbers say. It's very obvious the hotel is bottlenecking data to the extreme just to save money at the customer's expense with available bandwidth. The other complaint is the mattress selections. The quality in them cannot be compared because there is none. It is almost as hard as laying on the ground. I saw this complaint in a review before I booked here but gave it the benefit of the doubt. That was a mistake. The rooftop restaurant/bar is great too with beautiful scenery as well as the one on the 21st floor. Great dining areas too in their cafe on the 2nd floor. Very easy to get a taxi here as well and their shuttle is flexible for trips to places too. So Bai hotel if you are listening, fix the two things above and you'll see your reviews and reception from the public not to mention future sales peak to its highest capacity ever. Keep doing the great things you're doing like employing staff like Medardo and others that render great customer service and make it so it's easier to reach staff on your phone services too. Other runner-ups to work on is the amount of time it takes to get between floors or get an elevator at all.

,7266604,"FACILiTIES - The only ‚Äúoutdoor‚Äù you can do is the pool at the 21st floor. It is a safe option when you have a kid who knows how to swim but not yet that skillfull. Downside cannot use it when it rain and there‚Äôs lightning. Not Happy that we were not allowed to bring the pool towel to our room, imagine a shivering kid.
CHECK In/Check Out- It is not my firsttime but the staff at check in seemed lost. My voucher says it is already paid and was asked for payment again bec. They said that the payment was not reflected. I insisted  to the extent of showing confirmation that my cc was charged. It took awhile for it resolved. Check out was not hassle free made wait for 10mins.  
ROOM- Hotel is small, rooms smaller, small bathroom that you need to go to the other side ,close the door so you can reach the shower area, no iron &board in the room. Broken hair dryer, we had to switch rooms bec the first we had didn‚Äôt have any electricity.
Food- great selection ranges 1-1500 pesos
Accessibility- the hotel is near parkmall, Sm city and other resto but You NEEd car as it is not a safe area too many snatchers/hold upers. Taxi is an option which the hotel can get it for you.

 The breakfast and the hotel decor was nice & clean, The initial room had a bad odor and we requested a different room. Our request was honored. Also, It  is my understanding that on your initial entry into your room at a three to five star hotel a staff person will escort you to your room along with your luggage and provide a brief introduction to the room pointing out the various amenities and qualities of said room. An opportunity for the hotel to feature their reason why their hotel is worthy of their status. An opportunity to ""BRAG"" about their hotel. This hotel provided none of these qualities of  behavior in this regard.  However after the initial failures , the following stay at this hotel was professional, exemplary, helpful, and all around wonderful. From the cleaning ladies/staff to the front desk, to the entire breakfast crew,  the door men, to security. They were all exceptional. Using a baseball metaphor: ""They knocked it out of the park"".  I would recommend this hotel to all of my acquaintances & friends. However not my enemies. This hotel is much too good for stupidity. Respectfully

 Breakfast was awesome!
 The description on the App did not match what the Hotel offered. I have paid an additional 800 pesos for an ""upgrade"" as offered in the App and after the upgrade, it stated that I will have a ""double room"". When I checked in, the staff explained that the upgrade was for a higher floor and complete facilities. I was thankful to the staff who clarified the issue but I am disappointed in the App for it is misleading. I initially paid an extra because I was expecting to get a better room, a bigger space, not a higher floor with more complete facilities.",9.0,2024-04-14T11:17:36+07:00,0.8888888888888888,bai_hotel,breakfast awesome description app match hotel offered paid additional peso upgrade offered app upgrade stated double room checked staff explained upgrade higher floor complete facility thankful staff clarified issue disappointed app misleading initially paid extra expecting get better room bigger space higher floor complete facility,2

 The Bai Hotel was beautiful and the food we had was excellent. We ate twice at the rooftop pool area, once in the evening and once in the afternoon, and both were great experiences, with delicious food in a beautiful environment with an amazing 360 view of Cebu. It is very convenient to have late-night dining options at the hotel. The rooms are well designed with a contemporary and fresh look, and the lobby of the hotel provides an extremely impressive first impression. I stayed at another quality hotel in Cebu previously at about the same price, but the Bai was much nicer and we will stay there again on our next visit.
 The only negative about the Bai is that the location is not central to many shopping and restaurant options within walking distance, but there are plenty of options only a short cab ride away.",10.0,2024-03-20T13:57:47+07:00,1.0,bai_hotel,bai hotel beautiful food excellent ate twice rooftop pool area evening afternoon great experience delicious food beautiful environment amazing view cebu convenient latenight dining option hotel room well designed contemporary fresh look lobby hotel provides extremely impressive first impression stayed another quality hotel cebu previously price bai much nicer stay next visit negative bai location central many shopping restaurant option within walking distance plenty option short cab ride away,2

I waited there for 3.5 hours from 3:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. and it couldn't be repaired and I couldn't get an equivalent room. I was offered a much smaller room and I wanted the price difference, but was also rejected. I didn't get a refund for the room either and so I checked out of the hotel. I didn't use anything in the room I booked and just waited there. It was zero service. Never again.

 We liked pretty much everything about this place. The building was grand, the staff were friendly and service minded. The room was beautiful and modern, and the food was top notch. We ate both at their breakfast buffet, their marble + grain restaurant, and ordered some room service for lunch. It was all great tasting and well prepared.

They also take security very seriously. They check everyone who enters the hotel, so we felt very safe.

We also received a free room upgrade, which we didn't expect, but was very much appreciated. 

Thank you for making our stay in Cebu so memorable, Hotel Bai.

There is a mall nearby and if you would want to go into town, you can take a taxi or Grab!

Would recommend if you want time to relax and feel like a million bucks. We already visited a few days later as we loved it so much!

 The true value of this property is in it‚Äôs amazing staff..  from the security staff, to the concierge.. to the servers, the cleaners, everyone has a smile on their face, everyone makes you feel absolutely welcome..  I have never been treated so good at any resort in the world. I almost don‚Äôt like to single to staff members out because they are also incredible. But Vince and Venus went above and beyond, even though they are on a team of complete Rockstars. I appreciate both of them very much.
 The only thing I did not like about the property was with pillows, many of these hotels are moving towards these type of pillows that feel like they have air in them.. they are soft to the touch, but in my opinion, difficult to sleep on. My neck sore for 24 hours. I called to see if they had some different type of pillows. Housekeeping immediately requested to come and change them all, but I asked them if they are different or the same. And they told me all pillows are the same. This doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal for most people, but I can tell you that my jacket wrapped up in a towel was more comfortable than these pillows. Management needs to change them immediately. I would‚Äôve continued to stay at this hotel if it was not for this. I will come back, but only because of the staff.

 Nice hotel, big breakfast buffet. Staff very friendly and helpful. Located next to a mall. Beautiful rooftop pool area.
 Hidden charges!!  We had 2 cocktails and 2 dinners for room service, it was supposed to be around 1400php. When checking out the amount to pay was suddenly 2200. They charged us ""dinner tax, pool tax etc"". WhT for note sure as previous hotels have not done this and we were not aware there was extra fees to use the pool. Breakfast was big however my friend and me are not too hungry in the morning so we asked to just take 2 croissants from the buffet up to our room to eat later, but that wasn't possible. We had a lovely stay but those hidden charges gave us a bad feeling leaving this place...",7.0,2023-09-19T04:12:40+07:00,0.6666666666666665,bai_hotel,nice hotel big breakfast buffet staff friendly helpful located next mall beautiful rooftop pool area hidden charge cocktail dinner room service supposed around php checking amount pay suddenly charged u dinner tax pool tax etc wht note sure previous hotel done aware extra fee use pool breakfast big however friend hungry morning asked take croissant buffet room eat later wasnt possible lovely stay hidden charge gave u bad feeling leaving place,1

 Our stay in this hotel serves as our 1st honeymoon with my husband, and since this was the 1st day we meet again because both of us are working abroad, we were looking for a really nice hotel. I have a lot of friends in cebu and most of them recommended Bai hotel. And indeed, we had a really amazing and great time staying in this hotel. We were so lucky that the receptionist gave us an upgrade of the room from deluxe twin room to a king sized bedroom! We were so happy and excited. The room was really elegant and big with a beautiful city view at night. The breakfast buffet was magnificent. We all like the menu served and the time they gave from 6am to 10am is very nice specially for us who don't like to wake up early for the free breakfast. The swimming pool experience was also great and romantic. All of the staff we encountered were very polite, helpful and approachable. All in all, the experience we had was really amazing üíØ. Surely we will stay again in this hotel once we get back to cebu. Highly recommended üëç

 The facilities were fantastic. The shops are convenient. The lounge was great. Loved the caf√©. The buffet was very good.
 The rooftop Twilight bar. Oppressive heat and no fans, the barstools were uncomfortable for me being a large foreigner, and the rush to order drinks forced me to ask for a suggestion. I was told the Mai Tai is ""salable."" It was overwhelmingly bitter and was not my kind of drink. I instantly regretted it and wish I had been given more time to order. I stood almost the entire time and didn't take but a few sips. Once I was covered in sweat, we just paid the bill and left. Probably won't visit it again if we return.

 nothing much, it was a frustrating and disappointing night stay...
only entrance gate staffs are friendly, others really need retraining..
the hotel near to a small shopping mall that full of restaurants..
Walking distance to eating place around 5 to 10 mins...
 The breakfast foods are not hot, being offered to serve coffee but never delivered...
The checking in and out process took long time..
Receipt only available after request..
Room condition need lots of improvements, wall cushion got mould /water stains, floor full with scratches, dusty chair, door got mould stain, toilet wall got red colour stains and old & broken tissue box.
The initial room given has aircon condensation issue which leads to serious water dripping issue at bathroom.
Requested for room change but the whole process was length and not being handled well.
Going up n down the floors several times due to the replacement room key lock malfunction issue, even the manager's universal key also unable to unlock the door.

Check-in staff are polite and friendly
Great location for most places in Cebu
 - Hotel baggage staff moved my belongings into secret room, which I had to go into to get another credit card, and then found one of the staff going through my bags!
- Hotel has gone down hill (as with all hotels in Cebu area sadly) as foreign tourists are still very scarce.
- Too overcrowded with local guests taking up the rooms (amazed to see how the locals can afford to stay there the same as me)
- With near full occupancy you have to wait several minutes before a lift is ready to move you between floors
- Breakfast time in the restaurant is extremely noisy and very long queues to wait for mainly local focused cuisine (not nice food)
- Room was in poor state, dirty floors, dirty windows with bird excrement and had not been cleaned for a long time
- Difficult to call reception at times
- Check-in is a long battle (though the staff are friendly), it takes them a very long time to program their computer and a lot of paperwork to have to read and sign before you can get your keys
- No Express Check-in or Check-out facility
- Deposit in cash required, or if taken by card can take two months to be credited back
- No hotel liability if room safe is stolen or things in the room go missing (you have to sign a waiver on arrival)
- Entering hotel is slow, as security guard outside does a ceremony walk around car with angled mirror, but doesn't actually look at the mirror.  All bags are screened like airport security, just takes time with lots of bags.
- Chairs in room make it difficult to walk around the entire bed.
- Shower floor has moving grip tape
- Photos look nothing like the actual room
- Room cleaners knock often to check to clean the room
- Water feature in square outside not working (or not switched on)
- Main foyer downstairs over crowded (seemed like a wedding was taking place there)
- Bedroom lights confusing to operate - two glaringly bright lights over the bed
- Bathroom sink plug was closed and difficult to open
- Toilet seat at an angle

 Amazing service & staff. Comfortable rooms. Breakfast was HUGE buffet, everyone will definitely find something to eat. Hotel also has a small rooftop pool and 4 restaurants in case you want to have staycation like we did on our last night (pretty close to Cebu Int Airport).Tried also their gym and was offering enough equipments and free weights in its small zone.
 We would have wished that the reception told us about ‚Äôdress code‚Äô on the breakfast; men are not allowed in the restaurant in sleevless shirts. We didn‚Äôt mind the dress code but informing before waiting ages the ‚Äôtraffic hour‚Äô elevator to go back to 17th floor and back to 2nd was frustrating.

 The hotel is modern clean and comfortable. The roof offers great views over the city and access to two pools! The room was spacious and very comfortable. The proximity to the airport is helpful too and was the main reason I booked a night here.
 The only negative thing was that when I enquired about organising a transfer to the airport the concierge quoted me 1400 pesos for what would have been a 20 minute journey. I politely declined as this was far too much. He then reduced the amount to 900.

It was resolved but they ended up giving me 2-bed rooms instead of my original booking of 1 bed room. 

Breakfast time‚Äî staff told me I only paid for lesser people (when in my booking, I actually paid for 4 people *2 free breakfast/room*); again I argued and insisted my booking. Was resolved.

 Our overall experience was great and indeed, the breakfast was superb! The location is just in the middle of the city and transportation is not a problem at all. I will surely recommend Bai Hotel!

 I really like bai hotel but for this trip I was very disappointed when I checked out. the front desk clerk took too long. a man who came in later than me and was assisted by another person in his checkout was given smooth, fast and seamless service took less than 5 minutes. I arrived at the counter earlier than him but he was done in a few mins whereas the clerk who assisted me had to call housekeeping to check our rooms. they said it was protocol, and I know this is really done to check if there are damages etc but why is it that the protocol was not applied as to him?",8.0,2022-11-13T05:46:06+07:00,0.7777777777777777,bai_hotel,location facility food good really like bai hotel trip disappointed checked front desk clerk took long man came later assisted another person checkout given smooth fast seamless service took le minute arrived counter earlier done min whereas clerk assisted call housekeeping check room said protocol know really done check damage etc protocol applied,2

 The hotel is very nice, very clean and comfortable
 The staff were rude. I booked two double rooms but upon arrival I was told they only had rooms with twin beds, I informed them that I had paid for two double rooms but was told that the rooms were allocated on whom made the earliest booking. I disagreed with this and showed my booking was made for two double rooms and to be fair (albeit there was a suggestion I was lying about my booking even when providing evidence) I was upgraded but had one double room and one twin room. The next problem arose when checking out, I was charged for cleaning of a towel as it (as described by the staff on reception) had a small blood stain on it, I was asked how and why it had happened and as it was my partners sister who was staying in the room I had no clue why there was a blood stain. After asking my partners sister what had happened I was informed she had started her menstruation and hadn't realised. The staff showed no empathy and after staying in many hotels over the years this is the first time I have ever had to pay for anything like this.

 Our first time to try the breakfast buffet and we all enjoyed it. Room size was good enough. I did not expect that the 2 small beds, were not really that small. It could actually fit 2 persons. There is an ATM inside & outside the hotel. Although me and my son opted to stay in the hotel instead of our condo, we got the chance to have the view of it and the sea view. Front office staff were very helpful. They said they have upgraded us to a king bed but we did not want it and told them to stick to 2 single beds request and with connecting rooms or at least, with rooms close to each other.
 I got 3 rooms for my family and the room that I was in, if I don't close the toilet bowl cover toilet splashes when flushed. Check out is at 11am. Thankfully, before I left (since I was travelling), I went to front desk and ask for and extension until 1pm since we checked in very late afternoon.

 The staff are amazing, very professional and well trained. Random encounters like sharing an elevator they'll greet you and ask about your stay. I am not a king, but felt like one for a few days. Breakfast is luxurious, and Bai cafe counter layout made access to all those delicacies easier with the competitive guests. We booked two rooms for our family, and the on duty manager put us in neighboring room with side-door which was convenient. The rooftop pool is is pretty impressive, not deep enough for diving, but possible to do lane swimming, and great to laze under the cover and enjoy a mighty fine cheeseburger or pizza. Location is nice and close to Park Mall.
 One night, I needed to call operator or reception, and both didn't answer or call back.  (I suppose they were very busy, but a call-back would have been nice). Upon check-in arrival, we were dropped off by a taxi at the lobby xray machine, which was our first experience of the hotel (with an unhelpful guard). Tired from travel, with heavy suitcases and two kids, it would have been great to have a duty porter to assist load the xray machine (if that doesn't breach security protocol). Talking through the perspex reception screen with everyone wearing face masks, leaning down to try to hear reception staff through the holes is a bit of a challenge. (again, a covid protocol).  It will be good when they can dispense with that discomfort. The overall experience, after the initial arrival and check-in, was very positive, however.",9.0,2022-07-28T03:22:18+07:00,0.8888888888888888,bai_hotel,staff amazing professional well trained random encounter like sharing elevator theyll greet ask stay king felt like one day breakfast luxurious bai cafe counter layout made access delicacy easier competitive guest booked two room family duty manager put u neighboring room sidedoor convenient rooftop pool pretty impressive deep enough diving possible lane swimming great laze cover enjoy mighty fine cheeseburger pizza location nice close park mall one night needed call operator reception didnt answer call back suppose busy callback would nice upon checkin arrival dropped taxi lobby xray machine first experience hotel unhelpful guard tired travel heavy suitcase two kid would great duty porter assist load xray machine doesnt breach security protocol talking perspex reception screen everyone wearing face mask leaning try hear reception staff hole bit challenge covid protocol good dispense discomfort overall experience initial arrival checkin positive however,2

 We just stay here for one Night. The Size of the room was good and the staff was friendly. Also the style and the Interieur  of the hotel is nice.
 We just stay here for one night but experienced some negativ things about the hotel. First of All we arrived in the Buffet Restaurant and they told us that we will get a discount of 30% if were fully vaccinated (that was possible and definitly a positive point) and they told us if we're just 2x vaccinated (we get a discount of 20% - we had one person for that) - if we want to pay they told us the promo is not available anymore, but dont understand why they offer us before.
The Buffet for my opinion is very big and you have a lot of choises, thats why we been very excited. But for me the Quality was just middle - i defintily eat much better in different hotels in the Philippines.
Then unfortunately my little babyboy was sick and vomiting, thats why my wife decided to bring him to the room after the main course - so that we dont make any mess in the Restaurant and dont disturb the other guests. Because she cant really finish her dinner she was asking if I could bring her some little desserts to the room when im done - so I asked the Waitress and she asked the Manager- decision: not possible. I mean i can understand they want us to eat in the Restaurant and not in the room and i could also understand if we want to bring 5 platters with the main course but i just ask for one platter with just a little bit of dessert and i also told them i will bring the platter back after she finish. So i cant really understand their point even if we had a good reason because of my son.
The next morning we went to the Breakfast (buffet) and the lady at the check-in the other day offered us also a promo for the breakfast if im not wrong it was 540php instead of 988php and we said yes we want it please book that one for us. When we arrived at the Restaurant in the morning they told us no there is no promo booked for your room you need to pay the regulare price... after some minutes discussing they allow us to use the promo.",5.0,2022-05-18T10:38:12+07:00,0.4444444444444445,bai_hotel,stay one night size room good staff friendly also style interieur hotel nice stay one night experienced negativ thing hotel first arrived buffet restaurant told u get discount fully vaccinated possible definitly positive point told u x vaccinated get discount one person want pay told u promo available anymore dont understand offer u buffet opinion big lot choises thats excited quality middle defintily eat much better different hotel philippine unfortunately little babyboy sick vomiting thats wife decided bring room main course dont make mess restaurant dont disturb guest cant really finish dinner asking could bring little dessert room im done asked waitress asked manager decision possible mean understand want u eat restaurant room could also understand want bring platter main course ask one platter little bit dessert also told bring platter back finish cant really understand point even good reason son next morning went breakfast buffet lady checkin day offered u also promo breakfast im wrong php instead php said yes want please book one u arrived restaurant morning told u promo booked room need pay regulare price minute discussing allow u use promo,1

 Front desk staff verry helpful.
 Very bad system of checking out. Only one member of staff on the front desk at 10:45 (the peak of checking out time is ridiculous) she was doing her best and it was no reflection on her but management needs to fix this. After a wonderful stay with excellent service it took the shine off of our stay, which is a shame and definitely not representative of my stay .
Also the tiles on the bathroom floor were dangerously slippery when wet. An issue the hotel must know about as there was a horrid (but clean) rubber mat in the shower. Unfortunately the rest of the bathroom floor was like an ice rink too.
That said I would absolutely recommend this hotel to everyone.
