Agoda,827458020,"We recently stayed at Seda Ayala Center Cebu and had a pleasant experience overall. The location is perfect, situated right beside Ayala Mall, which made it incredibly convenient for shopping, dining, and entertainment. Having the mall so close by added a lot of convenience to our stay.

The room was clean and well-maintained, providing a comfortable environment for relaxation. In terms of value for money, Seda Ayala Center Cebu is an excellent choice. The rates are reasonable, especially considering the prime location and the quality of the accommodations.

However, there is one area that could use improvement: the buffet breakfast. While the food itself was good, the breakfast area can get quite crowded, making it a bit chaotic. It would be great if the hotel could find a way to better manage the crowd during breakfast hours.

Overall, Seda Ayala Center Cebu is a great option for anyone visiting Cebu. The unbeatable location next to Ayala Mall, clean rooms, and good value for money make it a solid choice. If they can address the breakfast crowd issue, it would make the stay even better.

The wallpaper on the ceiling in the reception area are peeling, the rooms have a musky old smell to the shabby carpets on each elevator bank to name a few. I’ve stayed at the IT Bloc and this place has a newer modern ambiance. Overall Seda Ayala Center gets three stars.

It also has grocery stores, clothing shops, telecom companies, foreign exchange, banks and much more. You can find a lot of things in the mall for your traveling needs.  This hotel is also close to a hospital.  
The breakfast buffet is great. Good variety of choices if you want light or heavy breakfast. My favorite is puto maya and chorizo de cebu.
Hotel staffs are helpful and attentive.

Some critiques:  somewhat worn carpeting in hallways.  Layout of bathroom is not very good for privacy, with shower easily viewable from entry door unless bathroom door is COMPLETELY closed.  But, also noted that the ventilation in the bathroom is very good, with the plentiful airflow exiting through the shower ceiling to keep humidity low after showering (wife appreciates this for doing all her girly stuff at the bathroom counter).  Mini-fridge is in a cabinet with poor ventilation (since the furniture is pressed against the wall, blocking the vent holes in the back) and I kept the cabinet doors slightly open to encourage better operation of the fridge while there - it's like 120+F inside that cabinet if I don't do that. 

We stayed there for a couple consecutive nights on two different occasions during our trip, the first was during the Sinulog, and the other was about a week later.  During Sinulog, and there were frequent performances of dancers and live music during that time, lots of photo opportunities and just very lively.

CHECK IN WILL INFORM YOU THAT THE ROOMS ARE NOT READY YET AFTER THE 2PM STANDARD CHECK IN TIME, you have to check every after 15minutes. 

And the excuse they will give is that the house keeping have not cleaned my assigned  room. And they know that tourist will be occupying the hotel since its sinulog they should be ready and has a complete and extra staff to make it smooth and fast. But they will always say its not done yet.

The towels are brown color, its harsh on the skin. And has torn parts esp on the edges. Its really horrible!!!
 
And upon check out I accidentally left my card case with all my cards and ID inside, I called the hotel to check if I left something, it took 20mins and no return call from them and I had to call them myself for follow up. And on my 2nd call i was on a 29 mins call with the hotels staff and decided to stay on the line for the feedback from the house keeping, and they said its not in the room. So I decided to ho back to seda and asked the front desk to allow me to go and check myself, ans viola I found it under the folded part of the duvet, and at 2:16pm the room is not even cleaned yet. So it made all sense why the room is not done and ready for the next guest to check it because they are under staffed. 
Overall was horrible experience and will not be coming back ever.

Agoda just said they apologize but we had to pay almost 18k more.
Advise people to be careful when they book online.  It would have been cheaper to book directly with hotel because Seda provides senior discounts.
Anyway,  the staff of the hotel are very kind and patient 
Everyone always smiling and helpful.

I see people keep complaining like every single day while we we're there. Staff at misto can't keep up serving drinks to people. I had to ask couple can of juice at Club Lounge for my husband which is quite crazy. Sometimes we rather to eat breakfast at the Club Lounge even they don't have much stuff to chose from but the staff there are very accommodating.   2. At Misto bar there are 2 female staff  by the entrance are keep there eye on us everytime we come to eat for breakfast. We usually come down little after 9am. The lady have a big mole between her lip and nose, and her colleague they kept looking at their wrist watch tapping it seems like we have to get out right after we get our food but yet they're still a lot of people coming down to eat.

Agoda,737430609,"I stayed at the Seda Ayala Center Cebu and found it to be extremely pleasant. It was my first business trip to the area. A whitetop taxi cost 500 pesos ($12 USD) to get there from the airport. The hotel has 24-hour security around the perimeter to prevent anyone from wandering in. Inside, it's very clean and well-decorated. There is a lot of staff to greet you and they are very attentive. The room was comfortable and suitable for a person of my height (6'2"" / 1.9m). The Internet connection is stable and worked well for all my conference calls. The breakfast buffet has a lot of options (American, Indian, Asian, & vegetarian). Location wise: there is a very nice indoor shopping mall with everything anyone could need within a few minutes walk. Other destinations are a short drive by taxi/Grab (the local equivalent of Uber). I've already booked my next stay at this hotel.

Agoda,726992404,"2 main reasons why I did not satisfy our stay in Seda Ayala Center

- Customer service : Very poor
1. At the beginning, our room was not available until I asked for the reason why and told the receptionist that I would wait for the room ready, and it ended up with offering double bed right away after I questioned why it is not available, what if I wait for the double bed room which I booked for, how long it will be etc. It was 3:30 pm to try to check-in with a female receptionist, who has mid-length straight hair style.

The thing is that she should have explained me first why our room is not ready, and have offered me 2 options to choose either I should wait or get a twin bed, instead of simply saying that we have only twin bed room. And I said why, she said rooms are full and I asked again is it because of cleaning? and she said Yes. She said you don't want? and I said Why would I? If so, I should have booked for twin. Very simple! 

During our conversation, she was texting on her WhatsApp and assisting me at the same time. I understand there is no problem with using her own phone as long as she assists their customer properly, but she didn’t.
No apologies given, No alternative option to choose from the beginning, No proper explanation provided.

2. Secondly I was surprised after she checked my ID and gave me a paper to sign with full of wrong information, including somebody's personal details like phone number, passport number, address, date of birth and etc. I said this is not mine and she said that JUST cross it with the line and put your information. I have never seen to sign with someone’s booking information mixed with mine over it.

- Room condition - So so, It would be great if there is a window or balcony, but it was ok. Cozy and clean.

- Breakfast (included) - Nice. small restaurant in the lobby area but enjoyed.

Agoda,723146640,"I had a beautiful stay at the Seda Ayala Center Cebu with my mother. The Front Desk was quick to check us in. The room was quite lovely and has the amenities expected from a topnotch hotel such as Seda: kettle, safe, good toiletries etc. I love the couch by the window and the marble coffee table as well. Breakfast was really good and they have quite a variety  of food choices from local to continental! The staff at the breakfast area were very nice and attentive. Housekeeping was good too. The lobby was lovely and spacious, and impeccably cleaned. I noticed how the housekeeping staff actually meticulously clean the tables at the lobby. Porters/bell service was very good too. It’s also right next door to Ayala Center, which is just excellent! There’s a separate pathway to the mall from the hotel. How cool is that? The lifts were also good and fast. The only things I’d say need improvement are: (1) the coffee in the room: it was poor quality instant coffee in a sachet, which didn’t taste good, and (2) the sheets still felt a bit damp. It did make my sleep a little less great, but not to the point of it ruining my stay. It wasn’t due to the cold room as I’ve not had this issue in previous hotels before regardless of cold AC or even during winter season. Drying the sheets better would be great. And (3) the music by the pool was too loud, especially as the staff keeps the door open (probably to keep the DJ feel cool as it is hot outside, though keeping the door open means more energy consumption, which isn’t very good for the environment and overhead costs). I know I did take the time to point out these 3 issues. Nevertheless, it was a great experience overall, as you can see from the positives I’ve enumerated above. I did have a lovely stay at Seda and would stay there again. I would highly recommend Seda Ayala Center Cebu!

It's not because I loved my stay but because I always give benefit of the doubt that maybe the hotel will improve i.e. odor will be resolved the next time I stay here. Unfortunately, its just the same everytime. The bathroom wreaked.. the lobby had a musty odor- it is so evident because you can tell the difference when you come from outside or when you come from a very nice smelling hotel like holiday inn.. I paid twice the amount of holiday inn's nightly rate and  i think its just because of location. The buffet was awful. Food wasnt great. coffee was the worst. The muesli I had was spoiled. The food was mediocre.. its very disappointing. The amount you pay for doesnt equate to the quality of goods and hotel they offer to guests. The hotel needs deep cleaning for sure not just externally but internally. 
What I enjoyed during my stay is the service of my housekeeping duo.. Rafgie and Rowell. They were phenomenal. Front Office staff were very welcoming as well as the security. Im usually a fan of  seda but not this particular one :(

Agoda,653421160,"I first stayed at this hotel some years ago when it was part of the Marriot chain. It seems to have declined a lot since then. But first, there are a number of good things to say about the Seda Ayala: The beds are comfortable, the elevators are quick, there is good hot water in the shower, the buffet breakfasts are quite good, the internet works, and the reception, housekeeping, technical, and restaurant staff are all friendly and efficient. (Mr Steven at reception went out of his way to make up for problems with the hotel which were not of his own making  - he should be a manager one day). However, on the downside: the central air-con system makes the rooms way too cold and there is little one can do to deal with this. Way too cold to be healthy and I had to go and buy extra clothing to survive (my coconut oil turned to a solid in the room). The bathroom is not fantastic: slippery floors, especially in the shower area; bidets were not working (but were promptly fixed when requested). The room itself (Deluxe) was adequate, but a bit drab with depressing, dark, abstract prints, no chairs for the dining table, a very narrow working space, and a smoke detector with a permanent flashing red light beside the bed. From an environmental perspective, little consideration has been given to reducing single-use plastics: the usual suspects are found in the bathroom and with the drinking water. The room service menu is very limited with some items not available. The restaurant is focused on buffet meals and offers little else. The wine selection is limited and not very good quality. Sadly, it seems that the excellent restaurant serving staff does not receive the ""service charges"" that customers are required to pay with their food bills. So, in summary, this hotel is a mixed bag that requires serious attention from the owners to bring it back to at least some of its former glory. For the time being, there is much better value to be had at other venues.

I did not understand why I had to fill up two forms - one for me and one for the hubby. It could have been one form for both of us right? The restaurant (Misto) - stressful. We ordered chamomile tea but given green tea. That's fine. But during dinner time, I waited 30mins for my order - International Set Menu. And given the wrong main entree. I ordered the Baby Back Ribs with Mango Salsa. But the server brought me Grilled Salmon Fillet. I said no to it. Then she came back saying - it's on the house ma'am as per our chef. I said - sorry, I do not eat Salmon. The food finally arrived after another 30 minutes. With cold rice. I hated to be a pest, but I don't like cold rice either. So I asked for a replacement. So yes, a supposedly enjoyable night with the hubby turned out to be a stressful one. :(  Did not plan on staying longer at the restaurant because I had an early appointment the next morning.

Agoda,484973921,"I booked the hotel for my senior parents and the main guest was my father. And since the hotel room was for 2pax with free daily breakfast they called out my mom to pay in cash as my dad was the main guest and they were saying he can have 2 breakfast in one day which doesn't make sense since it was a buffet and my mom was able to check-in and was registered in the hotel as the 2nd guest. There was a misunderstanding and my parents told the restaurant about it that it was their daughter who booked the hotel for them through Agoda. We had to call the main reception to advise the restaurant about the incident as it was paid and the daily breakfast was for 2pax. It was an awkward scenario since they called out on my parents on the 2nd day already which was a bit embarrassing as they caused an unnecessary panic to my senior parents. The matter was resolved and we understand that it was an honest mistake however, it was completely unnecessary since they didn't double check first given that the guests (both of my parents) were registered and my mom was able to eat breakfast on her 1st day. 

Anyway, it was a nice hotel, spacious and clean with an access to the mall at their back gate.

One my first visit i was not happy and i will not go into that here you can scroll back to see that.

What i will say is this hotel in my eyes greatly improved - front of house was much better this time taking the time to make sure i was looked after and had everything i needed.
Extended me the curtsey of a late check out as my flight was a late departure and were very friendly in all interactions.

I stayed in the club lounge again and it was great and well worth the extra

The selling point of this hotel is the location 2 mins and you are in the Ayala mall where all your needs can be catered for.

The pool area is a little small but adequate and the food here was great

Comparing my last stay in this hotel way back in 2019, it felt like the hotel has been refreshed. It felt more ""maaliwalas"" and the entire hotel smelled really nice. The lobby, hallway, room, gym, and other facilities are well-maintained. 

However, what makes this hotel stand-out for me is it's SERVICE and its food. 

The breakfast spread at Misto was really something to look forward to. I will always look forward to their hot chocolate (the best I've tasted ever), omelettes, garlic rice, and the dried pusit. All the rest are so good too. The spread at the Club Lounge during Evening Cocktails wasn't too wide, but it is more than enough to fill and satisfy.

Last but definitely not the list, I shall take this time to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to those staff who gave outstanding service.

Erlyn at the Front Desk, though she wasn't the one who checked me in, greeted me with a warm smile and welcomed me back as I was still approaching the desk. It is heartwarming that she still remembered me. She was also very kind when she checked us out.

Paulo, the Bellman who assisted us with our luggage when we arrived, was very helpful and kind. He gave good recos when I asked about nearby establishments. 

The Misto team, particularly Samantha, Sofia, Kenneth, Gade (Kitchen), and Castillano (Security) were all so remarkable. They are an asset. 

Marry of the Club Lounge also left a mark as she delivered impeccable service. She's always smiling and was extremely courteous and charming. 

Our short but meaningful stay in Cebu was made possible by the team. Ms. Gwen, you are doing such a great job with your team and Seda ACC family. Thank you for letting us enjoy our stay.

,911574603,"First and foremost - The staff of Seda - from security to reception to housekeeping to maintenance to the Misto Restaurant have all been exceptional!  Smiles and greetings everyday!

We stayed long term (two weeks) - I normally try to book directly with hotels, but the Seda price was $2,976 (AUD) - so I ended up booking through Agoda for $2,283 (AUD) - a saving of $700 (AUD).

We stayed in room 429 - with a view of the street front of the hotel just over the roof line of the entry.  (Last year in November we stayed for 3 nights on the 6th floor with a view of the Ayala Center Terraces and it was a great view especially since Ayala was decorated for Christmas).  It would have been nice to have a room on the Ayala side since we were staying so long, but probably ended up on the other side since we booked through Agoda.

The room was nicely decorated and the bed comfortable - the pillows were so-so.  Linens and towels were nice.  The TV channel list was not correct - and missing quite a few channels (I noticed this last year, but no updates were done to the list).  I scrolled through all channels, updated the list and provided it to Reception.  There was a sewer smell around the toilet in the bathroom - probably a wax seal gone bad over the years - to which we reported during our stay, but declined the offer of maintenance replacing (or moving rooms) as it wasn't too bad - but I confirmed with Reception when we checked out to have maintenance resolve before they put any other guests in the room.

The fridge (what they refer to as a ""chiller"") was warm - even on the coldest setting.  I reported it to Reception - they sent up maintenance to check.  They tried to tell me that it's only a ""bar fridge chiller"" - but there was no ""mini-bar"" offerings in it  - and since it was not operating correctly (chilling anything less than the room temperature) they replaced it with a proper small fridge since we'd be staying for two weeks and wanted to store drinks and snacks during our stay.  Additionally, maintenance also replaced the A/C filter in the room at my request since it looked like it needed changing.

Housekeeping staff (Grace and Mike) were great!  We didn't need daily service, but we did get towel replacements and fresh water every day.

We dined daily in the Misto Restaurant for the buffet breakfast.  It was nice to see a smiling Sofia (hostess) every morning.  Servers Rhea, Ivy and Ryann were very attentive and were friendly every day. 
Chef Aldie walked around the restaurant greeting guests and sharing special desserts on several of the mornings.
The food selection was really good - but as is with most buffets in the Philippines... The temperature of the food was warm at best - and some items (hash browns/potatoes at the start of line) were always cold.  Lower temps mean more bacterial issues with food.
** Special note for guests - get down there early (before 7:30am especially on the weekends) to get inside seating otherwise you'll be in the overflow area in the lobby or outside on the terrace overlooking the pool.

We got to meet Hayden Kho and his wife Vivian Belo in the lift one morning going down to breakfast.  I didn't know who they were when we entered the lift but my fiance was speechless and starstruck at the same time.

The location is perfect being located next to Ayala Center.  We visited the Metro Grocery store several times to stock our room fridge.  We also dined at Army Navy Burger (awesome ""California Burger"" - just like ""In-Out Burger"" in the USA), Gerry's, Casa Verde, Burger Haus (great German beer on tap) and TGI Fridays).

Pro's
 - Staff - by far just awesome! 
 - Location - Location - Location  
 - Room was nice and comfortable 
 - Morning Buffet selection and Chef Aldie visiting guests tables 
 - Security at every entry - and very friendly

Challenges 
 - Room fridges/""chillers"" - if they are not working properly and cooling items to at least 4c they need to be replaced as they are inefficient and wasting electricity. 
 - TV channel list / channel availability - needs to be updated when changes occur to programming. 
 - Morning Buffet food temperature

Will we stay again? - Absolutely! - We really enjoyed staying here for a second time and look forward to returning.

,906915018,"As always when we travel to the Philippines we stay at Seda Ayala Center Cebu. We stayed in a Junior Suite, which had a small anteroom with a sofa, table, closet and TV. I knew this suite and everything was as expected. When making the reservation I had ordered an extra bed, this was shown on the reservation with a one-time 2,000 peso. In the hotel I should pay this amount then daily, we have then waived it and used the sofa as a sleeping accommodation.

The room cleaning was sometimes very slow, we have made with the employee partly a cleaning appointment, which was then also times not kept. We also had to call after the room cleaning because the soap or toilet paper was not refilled. 

We had booked the room with breakfast, the rich breakfast internationally oriented and everyone should find something for his taste. Unfortunately, you had to regularly queue and wait until a place has become free. This was not so in previous years, one was then if necessary placed in the lobby, which dan rather reminded of a company canteen. We preferred to have breakfast outside on the terrace. When it rained, however, the water gradually penetrated the ceiling and breakfast was over. It seems that during the renovation a few years ago, the roofs over the terraces were not repaired, one has the feeling that the hotel has saved at the wrong end.

,892377910,"I have always been visiting Seda Ayala Cebu especially their restaurant to either have some afternoon coffee, to dine with friends, or just chill by the pool and drink cocktails.

 Last March 2023, I have a close friend who stayed there for 2 nights and she told me how amazed she was with the room service and all — we met at their restaurant and had lunch, their food was incredible . One thing we wouldn’t forget is how the servers had the initiative to transfer us to a different table since we were seated by the window and the sun was directly shining on us. 

Second, I made a reservation for my bestfriend and she was able to check in early which made her happy despite the long flight she had from Canada — the next morning she had a 6am major exam and decided to take it at Misto while having her breakfast, my best friend couldn’t forget the person who served her — Angelica, cause despite her early morning exam, Angelica figured and was kind enough to serve her some coffee and food while she was answering. 

And just last April 20 — we celebrated my mom’s birthday at their restaurant and she really had a wonderful time. We enjoyed the variety of food, everything was so delicious, they even sang a birthday song to my mom and gave her a free cake. Surprisingly, Angelica was there and she helped my mom with her halo halo and was kind enough to take our pictures too. Although we had a last minute miscommunication cause we asked for 3 extra teacups since we ordered Green Tea, the one who assisted us probably misunderstood and thought we wanted 3 more Green Tea (in a teapot) — but the cashier, Ivy, was honest and quick to realize we actually didn’t order more Green Tea but asked for cups and made necessary changes for our bill.

,889519110,"This might literally be the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed in for a long long time. Before I continue my dislike of this hotel, I must say that it is located very nicely beside Ayala mall which is a fantastic mall. Also, the staff have been mostly kind and enthusiastic to us. 

However, I cannot write a review based on what could be, but what I experienced. And what I experienced was mostly torture at nights. Am in their hotel bed as I type this, unable to sleep because they have construction going on at 10:30pm outside. Listening to the sounds of hammers and occasional shouting wasn’t how I envisioned my nights were going to be at Cebu. My wife and I already had to change rooms once because our first room was exposed to very loud live music coming from the mall from Friday to Sundayl. The second room was ok for abit but come the weekday, the construction has been non stop through the day and now into the night (currently 10:35pm)

If you are travelling to Cebu, you might be looking to go on day trips to nearby provinces like Oslob, Bohol, Moalboal etc and most of these day trips will require you to wake up early ~4-5am. The noise will most definitely make it difficult to do so.

I cannot in good faith recommend this hotel to any of my family and friends. And if you do book this hotel, I pray that you are a heavy sleeper/sleep easily or get a room that is away from the noise.

To add on to this, the hotel itself isn’t fantastic. You could tell that it had its glory days but it is now old and didn’t keep up with the times. Soap and shampoo etc feel cheap and the walls and mats are old and outdated. 

Again, good staff and location but I will never ever come back here to stay until maybe the construction is finished in a few years.",1.0,2023-05-08,0.0,seda_ayala_center_cebu,might literally worst hotel ive ever stayed long long time continue dislike hotel must say located nicely beside ayala mall fantastic mall also staff mostly kind enthusiastic u however write review based could experienced experienced mostly torture night hotel bed type unable sleep construction going pm outside listening sound hammer occasional shouting wasnt envisioned night going cebu wife already change room first room exposed loud live music coming mall friday sundayl second room ok abit come weekday construction non stop day night currently pm travelling cebu might looking go day trip nearby province like oslob bohol moalboal etc day trip require wake early noise definitely make difficult good faith recommend hotel family friend book hotel pray heavy sleepersleep easily get room away noise add hotel isnt fantastic could tell glory day old didnt keep time soap shampoo etc feel cheap wall mat old outdated good staff location never ever come back stay maybe construction finished year,0

The staff are a credit to the hotel, all staff that I interacted with, from the door man to the room cleaners, were 1st class.the room was a very good size, bed was very large and excellent condition. Bathroom and shower was very good and all very clean. Room comes with a fridge and safe. The cleaner will replenish your water supply everyday.

Small bar but a large restaurant, which I used several times. It does take a long while for food and drink to turn up, even when there is nobody else around and several staff. I would have eaten and drank here more if the service was faster. Food was generally very tasty, however, the Sisig was very oily and pork was very crunchy. A shame as that is one of my favourite dishes here in the Philippines.

There is a small pool which was never busy and sun loungers. Again, all clean and tidy. 

I used the gym most days but this is the are of the hotel that is in need of modernising. All equipment is very old, most failing apart in some way and the air conditioning in the gym area was very poor. The air con in the rest of the hotel was excellent so it must be broken in the gym for it to be that hot and stuffy. Not what you want when you want to work out.

*Upon entering the hotel, you will be greeted with their friendly staff. Queenie helped us during check in and granted our request to be at the upper floor for less noise and to have a good view of the city.

*The hotel is modern and the color scheme is refreshing to the eyes. It smelled good too. The sheets were clean and the room looked really nice. It had the usual amenities. 

*Breakfast starts at 6am. The food selection isn't that wide but the food tasted really good. Try their HOT CHOCOLATE. Super sarap! That was the best hot chocolate I tasted in years. 

*Ayala Center Cebu is just beside the hotel. It practically is walking distance. This I enjoyed the most. I shopped and walked back to the hotel.

The stated 24/7 valet parking doesn't exist. At all. But they sent a bellhop with me in car to take me to parking. Which is a 1km drive to end up 45 secs walk from elevators. But do to the limited parking available I didn't leave until departure. Which was not in our plans. We wanted to go to a couple places and didn't because of no valet.

When getting a Junior Suite, one would expect to be able to comfortably have dinner for two in room, at a table, together. Especially since we were there for Valentines day. That is not possible in the suite. Two people cannot sit at the tiny table.",7.0,2024-02-17T04:55:38+07:00,0.6666666666666665,seda_ayala_center_cebu,staff hospitality great try please sure clean facility safe feeling standard cheap filipino hotel buffet baked bean breakfast canned corned beef hash soooo salty exline cook teach cook egg make proper omelet two day row stated valet parking doesnt exist sent bellhop car take parking km drive end sec walk elevator limited parking available didnt leave departure plan wanted go couple place didnt valet getting junior suite one would expect able comfortably dinner two room table together especially since valentine day possible suite two people sit tiny table,1

 Great location, friendly staff, and nice facilities. Connected to the best mall in Cebu through an exclusive access from the hotel (2 minutes walking distance). Close to many coffee places and restaurants.
 Unfortunately there is some construction work happening outside the hotel, so it can be noisy during the day if your room faces that area. Nevertheless, the staff was very understanding and offered me to change the room. If you are planning to use the room during the day, make sure you request a room on the part away from the construction site.",9.0,2024-02-17T03:52:02+07:00,0.8888888888888888,seda_ayala_center_cebu,great location friendly staff nice facility connected best mall cebu exclusive access hotel minute walking distance close many coffee place restaurant unfortunately construction work happening outside hotel noisy day room face area nevertheless staff understanding offered change room planning use room day make sure request room part away construction site,2

 The service provided from security to door-persons to bell hops to concierges to one specific front desk lady(Steph) to all housekeeping who serviced our rooms.  All very service oriented.
 One front office did not check properly that our room has been fully paid and called me back after I checked out saying that there is still half of the bill unpaid.  It was embarrassing as I even paid for my laundry bill the day prior we were to check out to prevent any delays and hassle during check out date.  I had to remind the lady that I paid for 50% deposit way ahead of time when she was saying that I only paid for half when my card was swiped during check in date when it was actually charged for full balance payment upon checking in time.   She appeared to even doubt what I was saying and I was on the verge of opening my email and scrolling to locate my email thread with my deposit payment proof then she said let me check again.  She should have been thorough before putting a guest in an unnecessary embarrassing situation.  It would be good that front desk staff are trained to check before chasing a client and saying “hindi pa po kayo bayad.”  The person she asked to run after me was nahihiya somehow to say it kasi nga nakakahiya nga naman if it were true.  Rather than ruin my day, I just had to keep calm.

Further, when I had queries right after using the Bookings app and called in for room verifications versus the description stated on the app, Seda front desk canNOT answer queries properly.  There seemed to be a lack of knowledge as to their rooms’ features.  How can they sell the rooms if they do not even know what to answer.  I had to ask the reservations person to at least go to the rooms and revert after inspecting the rooms.  They just kept insisting that the powder room/guest bathroom is a piece of mirror which boggled me.  As I have never come across a powder room that does not have a lavatory and a water closet.  Thankfully, the person in the end after quite a bit of discussion agreed to do an ocular of the room I was verifying and called me back to confirm that what was described in Bookings app is wrong and I had to make an upgrade instead.",10.0,2024-02-07T16:25:01+07:00,1.0,seda_ayala_center_cebu,service provided security doorpersons bell hop concierge one specific front desk ladysteph housekeeping serviced room service oriented one front office check properly room fully paid called back checked saying still half bill unpaid embarrassing even paid laundry bill day prior check prevent delay hassle check date remind lady paid deposit way ahead time saying paid half card swiped check date actually charged full balance payment upon checking time appeared even doubt saying verge opening email scrolling locate email thread deposit payment proof said let check thorough putting guest unnecessary embarrassing situation would good front desk staff trained check chasing client saying hindi pa po kayo bayad person asked run nahihiya somehow say kasi nga nakakahiya nga naman true rather ruin day keep calm query right using booking app called room verification versus description stated app seda front desk answer query properly seemed lack knowledge room feature sell room even know answer ask reservation person least go room revert inspecting room kept insisting powder roomguest bathroom piece mirror boggled never come across powder room lavatory water closet thankfully person end quite bit discussion agreed ocular room verifying called back confirm described booking app wrong make upgrade instead,2

 Well, the hotel is outdated . Needs renovation, and the pictures don't reflect reality

But the noise from the traffic easily gets inside the room, especially at night you want to sleep. 
This is due to old alumimiums with the  single.glrass layer. Also, there is a new construction going on next to the hotel that makes the noise situation even worse.

 The Seda is a lovely hotel in Cebu city Centre. The staff are friendly and helpful and the rooms are spacious with a super comfortable bed. The immaculately clean hotel has a small pool and outdoor area which makes you feel like you’re not in the city centre but it’s in fact adjacent a massive pristine shopping mall with many restaurant or cafe options. Highly recommended trying the hotel buffet - the range of foods is amazing - very tasty!

 \We were loyal customers of the former Marriott and were very disappointed that they closed. Seda (part of Ayala Group) took over the hotel under their name.

 The stay itself was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff did an excellent job maintaining the room. The hotel’s location is convenient, particularly for families travelling with children. It has connected entrances to Ayala Centre vicinity.
 While most staff members were polite and approachable, I encountered challenges with the receptionists at the front desk. They seemed unaware of the queue, which was frustrating, especially after a long trip and dealing with 2 hungry and tired kids. A simple acknowledgment of the wait would have been appreciated.

 The location is perfect, to enjoy Cebu. The staff was absolutely courteous, respectful, helpful, accommodating. The breakfast buffet was very good, but needs some variety from day to day. Provide better coffee(brewed). Room service rates were reasonable, and food was great.

 The buffet breakfast deserves a special mention. Huge selection of delicious food we couldn't get enough of. The location is excellent too, located just next door to a huge mall. They also have an in-house massage service which was of great quality, although I probably would have preferred that the service wasn't delivered in your own hotel room.

 The proximity of the hotel to Ayala Mall. It feels like the mall is your backyard. There is a special entrance for hotel guests through the gardens of the mall. 

The bed is very comfy and the beds are twin size. Since we booked 2 rooms, they even gave us adjoining rooms without us asking for it. Very thoughtful.
 The bathroom has no bath tub and the lobby is small. The restaurant for the Bfast buffet is also small and can be a bit crowded although the turnover of diners were surprisingly quick.",9.0,2023-07-19T07:42:59+07:00,0.8888888888888888,seda_ayala_center_cebu,proximity hotel ayala mall feel like mall backyard special entrance hotel guest garden mall bed comfy bed twin size since booked room even gave u adjoining room without u asking thoughtful bathroom bath tub lobby small restaurant bfast buffet also small bit crowded although turnover diner surprisingly quick,2

 breakfast is very good and plentiful
 food made to order is very very expensive.
I don't like the cover for the quilt because it is made of some material that looks like plastic so that if you cover yourself with a quilt you will be hot under the quilt and if you are uncovered you will be cold. It is simply not possible to set the desired temperature in the room.

 Central location. Staff were friendly.
 If you’re booking for someone else (e.g. my parents in my case) be prepared to sign an “authorization form.” They want the original card used for the booking to be presented in the check-in counter, in my case it was impossible. I have to pursue an international call (I reside in the UK) so that they would understand that I couldn’t present my card for the booking. The staff was very swift in sending me the form that needs to be filled up, attached together with my scan copy of my pertinent card details and a valid Philippine ID. It’s such a hassle to do all these tick boxes as I have not encountered this circumstance. I understand that this is to prevent fraudulent activities but the booking system should be updated as we have stayed in other Seda Hotels and accepted payments from abroad.",7.0,2023-05-26T19:01:16+07:00,0.6666666666666665,seda_ayala_center_cebu,central location staff friendly youre booking someone else eg parent case prepared sign authorization form want original card used booking presented checkin counter case impossible pursue international call reside uk would understand couldnt present card booking staff swift sending form need filled attached together scan copy pertinent card detail valid philippine id hassle tick box encountered circumstance understand prevent fraudulent activity booking system updated stayed seda hotel accepted payment abroad,1

 The location next to Ayala shopping Mall is excellent. You can walk to everything. It was very close to the office I was visiting. The staff were polite. The room was on the small side but well laid out and had everything I needed. I especially enjoyed the comfortable day bed and the view. The business lounge dining room offered a good breakfast, afternoon snacks at 2pm and drinks and snacks from 5 pm.
 There is construction work on the road alongside Seda. The hammering goes from 7am to 8pm 7days a week. Some of the noise is muffled by the windows but not all. The in room dining menu described a pork and vegetable Pancit. I ordered it and it came with shrimp which I'm allergic to. The kitchen staff should always ask regarding allergies.

 The wonderful staff were so accommodating, so helpful and greeted us with beautiful smile.  I was impressed with how open and spacious their lobby was, it’s nicely decorated.  I like their buffet breakfast, enough selection of food both Filipino and Western style breakfast. This hotel is adjacent to the Ayala Shopping Mall where there’s lots of restaurants, coffee shops, shopping outlets and Supermarket. Our 2-bedrooms were not so small, good size… it has two double beds and a chaise lounge.
 I find the pool is too small, it needs improvement with the style/shape and surrounding landscaping. Additionally, there should be a separate pool for the children.

 The hotel is literally a few steps away from Ayala Center Mall. The staff were courteous and polite and the breakfast selection was excellent.
 The front desk was understaffed. There were only two staff manning the counters for both checking in and out as well as for other concerns. There were no bathrobes which is usually available at hotels within this price range. The towels were particularly old, darkened, and hard from repeated use. And the bathroom amenities were certainly not at par either. The lobby has this annoying loud music which were neither calming nor pleasant. I’ve stayed at other Seda hotels and expected more, but turned out dissatisfied.

 Great location. Ayala Center's just a few steps away. Staff were really courteous and friendly. Also, the Dining area staff (Misto) were attentive. Great food choices for breakfast too.

Stayed in one of their junior suites, air condition was working well and the wifi was strong too. Love the space and the shower plus you can access the Club Lounge on the 12th floor on specified times for breakfast, afternoon bites and cocktails. It was a lovely stay. Will definitely come back.

 The breakfast has become much better and meets international standards again. You should urgently point out that cellphones and tablets are in flight mode or switched off. Telephone calls and children's films only outside the restaurant. It is really extremely disturbing.  Nobody is so important that he has to make phone calls during his breakfast. Unless he has poor time management. SAD

- the staff is very friendly and always try to accommodage requests
- they have healthy meals which is great for those with dietary restrictions
- love the breakfast buffet
- fast wifi. my work is zoom-heavy and I was able to work without any internet issues
 cons:
- DUSTY! the room at first glance looks clean, but the corners and under the furniture are dusty, and the a/c is dusty too- it looks way overdue for a deep clean
- staff can be slow, especially in the restaurant, maybe they're understaffed?

 Very professional staff at check-in (quick, uncomplicated, friendly)
 below average for a 5 star hotel. many hot dishes were cold or lukewarm. The choice of cold cuts, bread, cheese is very limited. The location is perfect, there is only one big minus the staff at the entrance. No friendly welcome to bad and incorrect information about the really poorly signposted parking situation.",8.0,2022-03-05T02:13:41+07:00,0.7777777777777777,seda_ayala_center_cebu,professional staff checkin quick uncomplicated friendly average star hotel many hot dish cold lukewarm choice cold cut bread cheese limited location perfect one big minus staff entrance friendly welcome bad incorrect information really poorly signposted parking situation,2

 the room was quite big, bed comfortable. the catering staff were very pleasant and super nice each time they brought in food to the room, even giving me options not on the set menu. I sometimes asked them a favor to tell Reception to answer their phone. throughout my quarantine stay of 8 days despite the devastating effect of typhoon Odette electricity and air conditioning were available, water for shower and internet connection also (though we had 2 separate days without internet). no TV/cable after typhoon but didn’t bother me.
 limited information from Reception at time of checking in. asked for security deposit, gave me their inclusive menu, and showed me to my quarantine room. it got worst after typhoon Odette hit Cebu everything was a mess, phone kept on ringing for ages. and if answered, either I was put on hold or can’t give me any assurance about the delay in my PCR swab, considering the hotel was classified as Multi-purpose Quarantine Hotel they weren’t helpful and can be very frustrating. suffice to say, my quarantine stay was extended and stayed 8 days in total. being a ROF I had to pay for everything myself. I was glad I arrived home just before Christmas eve. I’m sure It would have been a better experience otherwise, it was just unfortunate a big typhoon happened.",8.0,2022-01-17T10:05:13+07:00,0.7777777777777777,seda_ayala_center_cebu,room quite big bed comfortable catering staff pleasant super nice time brought food room even giving option set menu sometimes asked favor tell reception answer phone throughout quarantine stay day despite devastating effect typhoon odette electricity air conditioning available water shower internet connection also though separate day without internet tvcable typhoon didnt bother limited information reception time checking asked security deposit gave inclusive menu showed quarantine room got worst typhoon odette hit cebu everything mess phone kept ringing age answered either put hold cant give assurance delay pcr swab considering hotel classified multipurpose quarantine hotel werent helpful frustrating suffice say quarantine stay extended stayed day total rof pay everything glad arrived home christmas eve im sure would better experience otherwise unfortunate big typhoon happened,2

 I stayed at SEDA Ayala Center Cebu to do my mandatory hotel quarantine. I availed their quarantine package which included 5 nights stay, full board meals (3x a day) and airport pick-up. Everything was seamless and very professional, the room was spacious, had enough light, and was very pleasant. The food was really good, they even ask you for your preferred next meal if you are picky; the servings were also enough. 

I especially appreciated their hospitality. On the day of my check-out, the test results were released very late and I couldn't check-out by noon. They let me stay in the room til 6PM for free, or until I got my test results.
 The check-in process was kind of slow as there was only 1 person attending.",9.0,2022-01-10T02:35:35+07:00,0.8888888888888888,seda_ayala_center_cebu,stayed seda ayala center cebu mandatory hotel quarantine availed quarantine package included night stay full board meal x day airport pickup everything seamless professional room spacious enough light pleasant food really good even ask preferred next meal picky serving also enough especially appreciated hospitality day checkout test result released late couldnt checkout noon let stay room til pm free got test result checkin process kind slow person attending,2

 I liked the location, it was perfect considering that it was adjacent to Ayala Mall. There was enough parking space as well. I also liked the staff that welcomed us, specially the bell boys. They were courteous and cheerful, which set our mood for the day.
 I didn't like the staff in the restaurant. There were particular persons I vividly remember who were impolite. While my husband was having his coffee, he stood for a while to get something and this man came and got hold of his cup to dish it out without even asking. This happened over breakfast, which is quite an important time of the day. I understand that attitude is subjective but this was a hotel, and human relations is quite a big deal.",5.0,2022-01-07T01:57:17+07:00,0.4444444444444445,seda_ayala_center_cebu,liked location perfect considering adjacent ayala mall enough parking space well also liked staff welcomed u specially bell boy courteous cheerful set mood day didnt like staff restaurant particular person vividly remember impolite husband coffee stood get something man came got hold cup dish without even asking happened breakfast quite important time day understand attitude subjective hotel human relation quite big deal,1
