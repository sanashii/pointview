Agoda,824862054,"What happens when a great hotel becomes a shell of itself? It becomes the waterfront. It is a real unfortunate thing. Using a booking agency to book my visit, I had to change my check in date, instead of being helpful, they just accepted me paying a night I wasn't there. No recourse, they hide behind the booking agency. Then they say they charge 1000 a night, but try to go to the bar at the pool with no cash, nope, you can pay for the room, but not for a beer after swimming. Utter stupidity. Then my daughter must have gotten out one of the waters so when I check out, I got charged for that (no worries, but duh, you couldn't have done that out at the pool bar? Lastly, half the swimming pool is roped off because the overhanging structure that was falling down 3 years ago is still falling down. Definitely the eyesore of the whole place. Smelly elevators (one we started calling the ""pee"" vator) and you have to walk to the lower level to pick up grab and of course the escalator is still broken (I think it was broken 3 years ago). It must be expensive to run the waterfront, but they need a tune up to justify the cost of this once amazing hotel.

Agoda,818761457,"The hotel is an older hotel whch is fine the lobby areas are pretty well kept as this is whats on show but behind the scenes it was a different story in the room. Very poorly maintained, old and quite dingy . The armoire that housed the tv was broken, with cracked wood and chipped paint all over. How Housekeeping or Engineering cant see this is beyond me or the hotel does not want to spend the money for repair but a simple paint job would have improved it immensly .. We checked out after 2 days as the water was COLD the entire stay so cold showers were the go and bathroom fixtures were tired and worn. Ordered in the lobby bar what was detailed as Nachos but was just nacho chips and salsa.. Would have been much better to detail as that on the menu to avoid dissapointment . It was around Christmas time we stayed (yes this review is a bit late) and you can see a lot of time and effort was put into the decrations and the large Christmas tree which we must say was excellent and a lot of time, effort & money was put in. ..If half as much effort was put into maintaining the rooms as the public ""SHOW"" areas then the review would be lot better sorry to say.. Also unfortunatley our room was directly overlooking a truck junk yard which in 3 decades of travelling the globe was probably the worst view i have ever had.. While i assume this is out of hotels reach to fix they should at least try and work out something with the owners of the that property to clean it up (maybe a Barter Deal or something similiar ) and at least if you are placed overlooking this shocking view it would have been nice to be  be forewarned or upgraded .. Sorry to say but short of the Xmas decorations beng spectacular the rest of the stay was far from that.

Agoda,798082661,"During my recent stay at the hotel, several issues marred what could have otherwise been a satisfactory experience. Despite my booking specifying a king-size bed, I was provided a smaller size, and the staff did not address this issue satisfactorily when I raised it. The Wi-Fi service was almost non-existent in my room, and the only solution offered was to use the equally poor connection in the lobby.The advertised soundproof rooms were anything but, as I could clearly hear housekeeping staff and other guests in the hallways. Additionally, the lack of a business center and advertised shuttle service to the airport were significant inconveniences, forcing me to print documents at the front desk—where they charged a fee per page—and arrange my own transportation to the airport.The gym facilities were unsafe; a missing knob replaced with tape on equipment resulted in a minor injury. This lack of attention to detail and the overall management's indifference to resolving issues significantly detracted from the overall quality of my stay.

Agoda,776290203,"It was good overall. I had to go to the American Consulate that is onsite so that was my primary reason for staying there. The dinner buffet was just OK. It wasn’t fantastic but it wasn’t bad the breakfast buffet was outstanding. I probably wouldn’t stay there again, because like I said, my primary reason for staying there was because the American consulate is on the ground floor of the building and I had an appointment at 8 AM that I had to be at. I think the hotel is more geared towards the local community with events and banquet facilities not for tourists. That being said if you have an appointment at the American consulate you can’t go wrong.

Agoda,756987897,"The hotel is impeccably clean. Breakfast buffet was very good with many choices for each type of dish, would recommend. 

The bathroom in our room had a bathtub which was good but no bidet which was bad. The bathtub, however, was smaller than bathtubs in other hotels such as Montebello. The hotel did not immediately provide bathrobes and slippers except by request, and requesting was difficult because the phone lines were down for maintenance.

Wifi was slow and full of restrictions; I was unable to use my Mi Box to watch my streaming services on the TV because of this. 

Staff are generally attentive to customer needs. However, I had one instance where the girl at the FO didn't understand my request for bathrobes and slippers even after I explained that the phone was down for maintenance.

The 4ft-deep pool was wide and nicely placed. The pool area had an unsightly barrier due to some damage or construction on what I assumed was a slide that was situated above the pool.

We attended the New Year's Countdown party and buffet, both of which were not worth the amount paid for (approx ₱4200 per head for 2 pax or 75 USD) but were otherwise decent.

Overall this is a decent place to stay because of its proximity to Ayala Center and IT Park, but Montebello Hotel which isn't far from here has a better breakfast for less, more expansive hotel grounds and bigger bathtubs in the rooms.

Consider Waterfront over other alternatives if you prefer the ornate decor and furniture of older hotels and want a spot that has good access to many different food places and tourist attractions.

The building is still iconic and the huge lobby is still awesome. I still dont understand staff who stand in the entrance door and greets the guests or visitors. Without the effort of helping out guests belongings. Anyway the aircon is not cold. The shower water pressure is weak. And the process of parking for the guests vehicle is confusing.

When we arrived, the hotel records only shows 2 adults, and breakfast is NOT included, etc.   We verbally expressed our complaints and the hotel staff told us to call Agoda and file the complaint.  Their explanation is that, Agoda assigned the booking to another travel booking agency and in the process the freebies and number of booked adults were changed.

In short, we were assigned an old room, with 2 single beds, with old carpet, that smell nauseating and ended up paying for extra for everything.

When you flush the toilet, it bubbles up a bit (with some splash) before it goes down, and the suction is not good. The shower causes a mess in the bathroom because it's still an old model. There is also no exhaust in the bathroom. The only good thing about this hotel is the staff, i guess. They're very professional and accommodating. I only stayed here because I attended an event. We had no aircon during the whole event so we were dying inside the venue. They said they had a blackout and were only using generators but when we got back in our hotel room, there was aircon so I don't know how true their excuse is. Anyway, if I'm not attending an event here, I definitely would NOT stay here again. Even the lower end hotels have better facilities, and they're much cheaper too.

A few minutes walk will take you to I.T. Park.

Here are some of the but’s with my experience staying there:

- The internet needs updating and upgrading. Everywhere I am in the hotel, the WiFi keeps cutting off. Something that’s needs looking into.

- Staff members professionalism. Whilst I find the Receptionist who checked me in very friendly and helpful, I found the staff including the manager on duty somewhat unprofessional. When I was checking out, there was a guest who was charged for smoking in the room. This argument escalated whilst I was being dealt with for check out and this staff member was sounding very patronising to this guest and I actually felt very uncomfortable with the whole conversation considering I was being checked out and I am hearing all of this. I’m sorry, but the way the staff member spoke to the guest was so patronising. After this argument, I told the Duty manager who check me out that they need to ensure that when they have a dispute with another guest is to set them aside away from the other guest like me. I can tell the Duty manager didn’t have a care a world with what I said. He just said okay.  Not even an apology was given to me and not acknowledging the fact that it was inappropriate for them to be arguing in front of guests.

I was very put off with how they have been handling these situations. I come from a service background myself, and just found it an uncomfortable experience.

They knocked on my door at 7:30PM on Valentines Day evening to ask if i wanted my room cleaned. I complained to the duty manager 30 minutes later and all she said was it is  their SOP and she only worked there. Never again will i stay there. There was other issues, but i just bit my tongue for one week. Hint: You get what you pay for in Cebu, Cheers!

One shower after me and my taxi driver loaded   the cart. Long line to checkout because they only had two people working the checkout counter.    The first room they gave me AC was broken ,phone had a bad connection,and the toilet didn't stop running after I flushed it. They upgraded the room to room 1410. The shower head was only 5'8"" high. I'm 6'1""  with a bad back and had to bend over to take a shower. Not very comfortable. It was difficult getting into and out of the shower as the bathtub was too high. I felt like I was jumping over a high hurtle. Old folks would have a rough time getting in and out for sure.  Plus the bathroom was small. The room was OK. However, the TV stand was low making it difficult to watch TV while laying on the bed. The room could have used a new paint job.  Location wasn't the greatest. You need to take a taxi to get to a mall or restaurant.  They do offer a shuttle that I took to Ayala Mall that runs at 10 am and will pick you up at 2 pm. I thought that was pretty good.

The staff at the entrance were always helpful. Our room had a very nice view of the mountainous area which looked like it had fairy lights at night. The shower was faulty though. Still, we had a wonderful stay except for what happened during our last night. At around 3am, we heard some banging on the walls and the loud voices of a woman and a man. They were fighting in the hallway. I think the walls weren't thick enough to muffle their voices as I clearly heard what they were fighting about. I don't know who booked the room, but the woman didn't seem to have her key card with her and was begging to be let in. We were quite shaken being awakened at that hour. It continued for a few minutes. I think they resolved their issue in their room as it became quiet after a while. The elevators don't have a card tap system. The hotel is quite safe. But I think having one would increase the hotel's security.

A. I appreciate that we were given the option to check in early. Unfortunately, the only available room was twin beds and I didnt want to wait 3 hours to check in. App stated check in time was 2 PM, staff said 3 PM.

B. We checked in around the time others were checking out so I understand the wait. Staff were friendly and accommodating

C. Room was comfortable. The AC worked, we had the hot and cold water option. However, I didnt like that you had to stand in the tub for you to shower. The tub drain looked like it still had some dirt and grime on it. I had to run it under hot water for quite some time. There was no bidet as well. 

D. Their TV definitely needs an upgrade too. Smart TVs are something that they can invest on. The wifi is pretty slow as well. It sucked that they had no slippers for the guests.

E. The bed is very comfortable. We slept really well.

Our overall stay given the price and experience was still good but there definitely is room for improvement. 

Would like to share one thing. Around 3 AM, someone knocked on our door. We were in the 3rd floor and we were woken up by someone knocking on our door. My husband asked who it was and the person on the other side replied, ""Nag room check ra mi, Sir.""

We're unsure if the said person was a legitimate employee or if otherwise. It still boggles me until this day who was on the other side as we were not expecting guests nor did we request for any service or housekeeping. Weird.

Agoda,510619160,"We have stayed regularly at Waterfront over the last 10 years except for during 2020 and 2021 due to covid.
Generally, everything was very good as expected from previous stays, however I make the following observations:
The pool area needs an upgrade, especially exposed drainage channels with green algae.
I do like a cup of  English Breakfast tea with breakfast. Waterfront Uno restaurant provides EB tea in a large teapot on  a warming appliance.
Trouble is getting a decent cup of tea from that big pot is hit and miss as as it depends how long the teapot has been there.
After two days of luke warm cups of tea this time, I asked a waiter for a pot of tea to my table please.
The waiter replied, that will be an extra charge Sir. I said how long have you been working here? Waiter replied 2 months. Well I said I've been coming here for 10 years and never been charged for a pot of tea before.
From then on subsequent mornings waiters sometimes delivered freshly brewed pots of tea to my table without me asking, no extra charge.
But I found another way to get around it.  I simply took a  tea bag each day  to breakfast and went to the drink bar and asked for boiling water in my cup. Simple, no dramas.
The restaurant staff probably think asking for a pot of tea at your table is asking for special service.
No it's not. I simply wanted a decent cup of tea.  The general tea pot that could be there for 15, 30 minutes or more does not provide a decent cup of tea.
All other hotels I've stayed at provide an urn with boiling water and tea bags. You make your own. No special treatment, no dramas and you are assured of getting a decent cup of tea every time.
Why doesn’t Waterfront do this?

No valet readily available. Staff is either absent or unavailable. We have to request for a bellboy or valet to help us with our luggages.

Rude telephone services staff.  A male voice, I requested for late check out but I was answered with a direct response. No thank yous, no good morning. It seems like he can't be bothered by my request. I was appalled by that demeanor.

No available benches in the lobby. All the chairs are reserved for dining customers only. Talking about unwelcoming lobby. At least put a bench near the entrance so that guests like me can readily sit while waiting for our lift. Take note, I have a toddler with me.

It's quite expensive for that service compared to other four star hotels. The decors and the hotel itself is outdated.

Agoda,509845166,"Check-in took 1 hour and the people behind me must have been waiting for 30 minutes more at least. The reason only two receptionists for a 500 room hotel!
Check out at 5:00 a.m. only one staff, and they need to check the room before to give you the authorization to leave the hotel, time consuming when you have a flight to take.
The room looks like an old Las Vegas hotel with the wood furniture in bad condition.
The shower head must be 1.70 m high, I am 1.90.
The amenities are plastic and contaminating the environment.
The air conditioning control was not working and blocked at the coldest temperature. The only possible control was on the fan strength or turning the air con off. 
I ordered two shakes and a pizza for a quick snack, the shakes arrive in minutes and the pizza took more than half an hour to be served. 
In the afternoon impossible to nap as the staff was very noisy in the corridor, talking very loud. 
The flooring around the pool is really cheap and not friendly.

The hotel offers varied and huge spaces, but they are more representative, I think, of an earlier era that was driven by conventions etc. They are more less diminished from the rise and dominance of the internet... there is something very short-sighted at the upper management/owner level, except that they have a huge amount of property that will probably come to market someday in Cebu...

The Waterfront Hotel architecturally is a marvel. We enjoyed going for walks around the outside of the building and inside the building and observing the huge art works on the walls and ceiling. What was also great was the restaurant and cafe options on the Lobby level of the hotel. We particularly liked the food and service at the La Gondola restaurant.
We also appreciated the hotel's pick up service. At our request the Waterfront Hotel organized for a driver to come to meet us when we arrived at Mactan-Cebu airport to drive us straight to the hotel which certainly was a great help for first time visitors to Cebu like us!

Since my boyfriend is an Arab I’m the one to choose the right hotel here in Cebu just to show the hospitality of the Filipino . It was a long decision to make and choose a welllknown hotel in Cebu  it’s because we had been so many famous hotel around the world . since we are living in the middle East just to feel the differences we tend to find a unique hotel during our vacation . Me and my arab boyfriend was upset by the time we enter the main entrance of the hotel.  There is one security guard name Gonzales who went us and talk very rudely. Instead of welcoming us and explain about  the rules here. Because we are using a big motorbike here in Cebu but it’s very shame the way he talked to us is not acceptable as a guest . Me and my boyfriend felt uncomfortable that time. And was shocked ! We are not homeless he should not talk like that and he’s behavior is funny. He don’t even talk to us nicely and calmly. And there’s one more funny thing about that security, we asked him to give a few minutes to enter the reception for our reservation before we park our motorbike because we are in a rush time . So after that we were at the reception talking to the 2 ladies . And I don’t understand they are struggle to attain the guest  one lady talking the phone and the other one making herself busy instead of assisting us first and explain about the rooms and the procedure we deny feel they welcoming us . No smile at all even they are wearing a mask we can see if they are smiling or not . So we spend an hour to request our reservation that time. And so ridiculous that security came to us while we are sitting in the lobby with my boyfriend. Because we discuss about our plans for that day. And the security suddenly came to us and keep telling us that we need to park the motorbike . Very annoying !! Common . The management of the hotel pls take action for this ! I don’t want to feel that to any of ur guest !  We don’t even complain the room that they gave  us. Very old and not so clean as what we expect . We found a dusty ..until we checkout that hotel one more security is very annoying ! We asked him to find a taxi for us because we are so late for our flight . But he told to us to wait. But he’s gesture was so bad . They are not doin their job . They act like they are the boss haha lol 😂   .. and the funny is I can understand their dialect . They don’t talk to my boyfriend I don’t know why they struggle to explain to him in English . They let me explain ito my boyfriend. For what?  Talked to him !!!

,866221915,"I have been a regular guest at Waterfront Hotel Cebu City & Casino for the every year for the past 15 years except 2020-2021 due to covid.
Frankly, I see a decline in service and facilities and there is little or no action to address this.
At breakfast I requested more milk for cereal as the milk carafe was empty. To my surprise the waiter returned with a 2-litre carton of unchilled milk. After explaining to him that cereals are always served with chilled milk he returned with chilled milk. But next day same thing. The milk in the carafe was not chilled and the container it was in had no ice to keep it chilled. Once again, I asked for chilled milk and it was replaced. I later saw a manager pointing out that chilled milk is standard provision for cereals and all hotels follow that just as Waterfront has always done in my previous stays there, including my stay at Waterfront Cebu City in May this year.
The manager totally agreed. Next day on entering the restaurant for breakfast a waiter approached me and said you want chilled milk sir? No I said, not just me, everyone expects chilled milk for cereals. I pointed out juices are provided there chilled in dispensers.  Milk should also be provided chilled for cereals and simply just for drinking a glass of milk.
Two days later it happened again - unchilled milk. After leaving the restaurant, I asked to speak to manager, a different one this time. This manager also agreed and same thing again followed next day. A waiter asked if I want chilled milk.  
The two managers were simply identifying the issue as a special request by a particular guest. No.  It is not a special request. Providing chilled milk is a standard requirement for all guests and up till now Waterfront has always automatically done that without being asked during my many stays there, as it should.
Suggestion: Get a cold liquid dispenser for milk just like the 4 chilled juice dispensers that are there in the breakfast restaurant.
When we went down to lower lobby we immediately noticed a bad odour in the corridors like the smell from a rubbish tip. It became clear, that this was not just our imagination, when I saw a small air purifier turned on at a power point in the corridor. But clearly this little purifier was not enough to dispel this odour which was also  outside in the garden and pool area which is critically in need of redevelopment.  Alarmingly, there are no proper change/shower/toilet facilities in the pool area and this was the case well before covid 19. The previous male facility for the pool which had showers, lockers and toilets has been closed for many years. I was told the nearest male facility was in the gym back inside the hotel, quite a distance from the pool. Totally unsatisfactory. You don’t want to walk inside the hotel wet after using pool. And what are they doing about it? Nothing. Still in the too-hard basket.
The previously provided shade umbrellas have gone. Not one umbrella there. Ground drainage channels need upgrade- algae should not be visible. The rock looks like it has passed its use-by date. Pull at down and redevelop the area providing proper change room facilities.
I reported the odour issue in the lower lobby to a manager. The manager agreed there was a bad odour there but days later no change, odour still there with the one small air purifier working.
I get the feeling, Waterfront has been aware of this odour problem for some time but has taken no proper action to address the issue. I might add this odour problem was not there when we stayed in the hotel earlier this year in May.
What needs to be done? Provide more air purifiers? No. No. No. Track down the source of the smell and contain or remove it.

,844965707,"I've been staying at the Waterfront Hotel every few years since 2008. It used to be the go to luxury hotel in Cebu City, and I loved everything that the hotel had to offer.
However the hotel has as of recently dropped below its 5 star standards. Customer service is second to none as always, and it's a reason that I still remain a loyal customer.
Some points to consider;
▪️The room bathrooms now show visible mould
▪️Basin tap was leaking
▪️Carpets are very worn out
▪️Rooms appear very dusty in hard to reach areas
▪️Room walls have discoloured.

The lobby is a great part of the hotel, I would bring guests here to drink almost every night, an excellent part of the hotel offering.
The breakfast buffet was brilliant as always with a huge selection of international and local dishes.

 The room smelled musty, we wanted one bed, but they gave us two single beds pushed together. They literally just pushed together, obviously, there was a gap in between so it's still like sleeping on a separate single bed. We thought that they would at least modify the bedding and the linens. Speaking of beddings and linens, they had this old, mostly, mouldy smell. The toilet was clogged after one use, the THERMOSTAT WAS BROKEN. It was 11 degrees in the room when we woke up after our first night. We left the hotel slightly under the weather because of the irregular and dysfunctional thermostat. The floors and even the carpet were sticky. We can hear the people from across the room and they weren't even being loud. They were just having a normal conversation but we can still hear them. There were NO ISSUES with the staff, just with the actual facility and hotel itself.",1.0,2023-11-07T17:15:11+07:00,0.0,waterfront_hotel_and_casino,room smell musty want one bed give u two single bed push together literally push together obviously gap still like sleep separate single bed think would least modify bed linen speak bed linen old mostly mouldy smell toilet clog one use thermostat break degree room wake first night leave hotel slightly weather irregular dysfunctional thermostat floor even carpet sticky hear people across room werent even loud normal conversation still hear issue staff actual facility hotel,0

 The rooms were very clean and spacious. They are a bit out dated but the hospitality and amenities definitely make up for it. The beds are quite comfortable and the AC was able to keep our room at a decent temperature. The Wi-Fi though could use some work. The signal was very spotty. It was either too weak to connect or not strong enough to keep a stable connection. At one point I just started using my data because I got frustrated with the constant disconnects. 

The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful when we asked questions, always smiling and greeting us when passing in the halls or lobby. Check in did take longer than usual as there was only one receptionist, we arrived around 7PM, but when we checked out a few days later there were 3 people working front desk. The pool area is HUGE and there is a life guard on duty, good idea since the main pool is quite deep right from the start. I'm 5'6"" and  couldn't touch in the centre. There is a kiddie pool separate from the main pool as well. The hotel offers swimming lessons for kids which was really nice to see. Unfortunately the waterfall was under construction but the outdoor area was still beautiful and we enjoyed our afternoon there. There were plenty of loungers and seating available around the pool so finding a close seat was never an issue. 
In the mornings there is an outdoor space, same area as the pool, to enjoy yoga and the gym was one of the nicest ones I have seen in any hotel (or some gyms even!). There is room service, avail 24 hours, and a few restaurants on site. However they were a little over priced so we opted to eat out or have delivery. We don't gamble so we never bothered to check out the casino side but it looked quite popular. At the main entrance there is security and a dog on site to ensure the guests safety. 
We had such a relaxing vacation and a great time visiting the city. Highly recommend staying here if you get the chance.

I saw a casino and I believe I saw they had a bar, room service, though more on the expensive side, had a lot of options and is 24 hours when I was there.
 There is a limited amount of plugs in our room, though it's not a big upset, it was still a little inconvenient. There is quite a big step to simply get in the shower, I did find it a little strange. A big upset that there are two waterfront hotels. This one, and the one right next to the airport, and unfortunately I wasn't able to cancel my reservation without a fee, though it is my fault for not paying attention.",9.0,2023-06-03T18:17:16+07:00,0.8888888888888888,waterfront_hotel_and_casino,hotel absolutely beautiful service exceptional leave super early flight accidentally book hotel think one front airport although werent able switch book happy find u taxi pick u early morning hot water bed decent unable use good amenity saw since flight early saw casino believe saw bar room service though expensive side lot option hour limit amount plug room though big upset still little inconvenient quite big step simply get shower find little strange big upset two waterfront hotel one one right next airport unfortunately wasnt able cancel reservation without fee though fault pay attention,1

 For dinner we didn't try the dinner buffet because we were not hungry enough so we decided to order Ala Card. The food in the Uno restaurant is very delicous and the stuff are very friendly as always but how can you forget the plates. But how can it happen that the dimner will be served but nobody noticed that we do not have any plates. How are we supposed ti eat it. So we gave the restaurant another try at the next day during the breakfast buffet. The choices are great, stuff were very helpful and food again was very delicous. Unfortunately, the stuffs are a little bit disorganized and the stuff who guide you to your table are not aware which customers were first in the line, so it happened that other customers after us were served first. If you finished your plate they will directly try to get the old plates which is ok but please stop asking customer if you can have the other plate which is under your current plate while you are still eating.

 I booked two rooms, I was told on check in that breakfast was included for both rooms. The hotel gave me cards confirming breakfast was included for both rooms 

At breakfast they claimed it was only included for one room and refused to let me finish a coffee. I paid their charges including for the breakfast that they would not let me have 

The WiFi did not work either

 Only the lobby
 Check-in took forever and it was inaccurate. Booked for 1 adult and 1 child and only reflected as one adult and was told I have to pay for breakfast for my child. 

The hotel upgraded me but actually it was actually a downgrade. The Ambassador room was dated and my initial room had a double bed but was given twin beds. Beds were uncomfortable and one of the twin beds was already leaning on the side.

The elevator also had a mind of its own thus being on 18th floor did not help. On the outside of the elevator, there was no indication which direction it was going - either up or down. 

The bathtub certainly needs to be uprooted and replaced. All chipped in so many places and the temporary remedies they made kept floating whilst having a bath. Missing shower cap on amenities and had to request for this. The room was also only provided one toilet tissue so this was also again being requested. 

The room was however clean and of ample size. The view was absolutely rubbish during the day since you then overlooked some deprived areas of the area. The room lacked charging sockets too. 

Disappointing breakfast to say the least and certainly wasn't worth what they were charging. 

Check out was exactly the same as check in that took forever.

The hotel's parking area also smells and is dirty. 

Thank goodness the staff were brilliant with an exception of the Front desk / reception staff who I feel deserve more training and in my opinion were not very good at what they do.

 They have great facilities including some nice restaurants, a casino, separate kids and adult pools, and the best hotel gym I have ever seen. The gym had a cross fit training area, a boxing ring and one of those air aerobics rooms where people hang from curtains. You would never know this as there is absolutely no marketing to guests at check in or in the rooms. Maybe that’s why the restaurants are empty. 
The staff was consistently gracious and super friendly. Requests for maintenance and laundry pick up were prompt and professional. 
Kudos go to the front desk manager who, unlike her colleagues, jumped in to assist when there was a long line. Also the sales department who booked one group after another, keeping the property full. Maybe they can apply their talents to some in house marketing
 What bothered me was the overall lack of management presence, supervision, and training of staff. This extended to fine dining mechanics and timing, to housekeeping details, and attention to the breakfast buffet. 
For example, there was a huge line at the egg station. If the manager checked, he would have seen that a cook who was trying to help the woman at the egg station was instead getting in her way. He kept invading her space and breaking her rhythm. If I was managing a restaurant in town I would hire that woman and double her salary without hesitation. An outstanding employee by any measure.
