I also need to request a shaving kit. Additionally, the communication between the front desk and the food and beverage staff has been poor.

Agoda,830016872,"We stayed in Dusit Thani mactan for 3N4D. What a big disappointment for a 5* hotel. The bidet is leaking, the glassdoor in shower has broken glass sealant that cause water to flow all over the floor. The top shower is leaking, the extra blanket is USED! It stinks for real. The sliding cabinet door is broken it does not close completely. 
Our room is in 5th floor sea and pool view, you can see from our room that the pool water is not clean. We try to swim for less than an hour because we felt kinda itchy. 
Prices for room service and consumables it'll break your wallet. 
Every move in there has a price. Nothing is free, except hassle and stress. Never again.

Food options were limited as well and price for the food was extremely high. I understand that it is a 5 star hotel that’s why the price was high but the qualify of food wasn’t that great. Asked for an omelette during breakfast and I swear it was the worst omelette i ever had with regards to the taste and the presentation. Overall i felt that value for money wasn’t there. They have nice ambiance on the beach and poolside tho and front desk was helpful to me when i asked for a late check out the ff day.

Agoda,809888675,"Here is a sample review for a hotel that may not be considered value for money:

""Unfortunately, my recent stay at Dusit hotel did not live up to my expectations in terms of value for money. The room rates were quite high compared to the quality of accommodation provided. Additionally, the food prices at the hotel restaurant were exorbitant, making dining on-site unaffordable for a budget-conscious traveler like myself. I also observed that other hotels in the area offer more competitive rates and inclusive packages that would have been a better value for the money. Overall, I was disappointed with the overall affordability and value proposition of my experience at Dusit Hotel

Agoda,803626796,"My recent stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment I made my reservation through Agoda, the experience was filled with pleasant surprises and thoughtful gestures.

Upon arrival, I was initially taken aback by the additional charge for a sea view room. However, my surprise quickly turned into delight when the front desk graciously informed me that they had upgraded our accommodation free of charge. This upgrade was in recognition of our anniversary celebration and impending proposal, setting the tone for an unforgettable experience.

The panoramic view of metropolitan Cebu from our upgraded sea view room was simply breathtaking, stretching from Liloan to Mandaue. It provided a stunning backdrop for our romantic getaway and added an extra touch of magic to our special occasion.

Each morning, we were treated to a delicious breakfast spread that catered to every taste. The pool, with its expansive infinity design and captivating views, offered the perfect setting for relaxation and leisure.

The refreshing scent of the comfort room near the elevator contributed to the overall ambiance, enhancing our mood throughout our stay. Despite the pebbled sand on the beach, the crystal-clear waters and abundance of fish created a serene atmosphere reminiscent of Amanpulo, making our beach outings truly enjoyable.

The efficient air conditioning in our room ensured maximum comfort, allowing us to escape the tropical heat and unwind in peace. The hotel went above and beyond to accommodate my request to display a proposal message on the TV screen, leaving my girlfriend pleasantly shocked and adding an extra layer of romance to our stay.

The unexpected gesture of a complimentary moose cake for our anniversary was a delightful surprise, surpassing all expectations. Furthermore, the expedited check-in and check-out processes exemplified the hotel's commitment to exceptional service and guest satisfaction.

Despite mentioning a security deposit, the hotel demonstrated flexibility and consideration, given the short duration of our stay. The actual view of the building exceeded the images advertised on Agoda and their website, further enhancing the overall experience.

Moreover, the availability of HD channels on the TV and the thoughtful gesture of designing roses and flowers added an extra touch of elegance to our anniversary celebration, making it truly memorable.

In summary, Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu provided an unforgettable and magical experience, making our anniversary celebration one for the books. I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to create special memories on a special occasion.

Agoda,782472477,"The resort is very clean and food portions are more than generous. The beds are comfortable. The fitness dance performances by the pool and traditional dances in the lobby are fun. We were glad we stayed in Tower 1 which was away from the noise from the evening festivities. Noise in the hallways or other rooms was also minimal. The massage at the spa was okay, but you can get better quality treatments in town for a cheaper price. The gym was well equipped, but there were no towels or cleaning supplies to wipe down the machines when we went around 6:30-7:00 am (and six people using the gym at the time so it’s not like equipment wasn’t being used). The food was fine, though there are not many healthy options if you’re watching what you eat— even the kale was fried. The Thai restaurant had the best food, but it needed more spice or at least the usual condiments for guests to spice their food to their liking. A San Mig is 350 pesos at the hotel. There aren’t easy-to-get-to dining options outside of the hotel so you can feel captive to the pricing and options. It was hard to find servers or get their attention except in the morning or if you’re sitting directly at a bar. That being said, all servers were friendly and accommodating when you could find them. Overall, I expected better for the price.

Agoda,766487641,"I booked this hotel for 5 days thinking I'd have 5 star hotel experience, but was pretty disappointed overall. If you book this hotel, expect this place to be a 3 or 4 star experience.
Overall build quality of this place was disappointing. The shower head holder was cracked (photo attached) which caused the shower head to drop on my wife's head on the first night. Not sure what the interior designer was smoking when he/she designed the bathroom area but expect a mini flood after taking a shower as there isn'ta barrier to block the water from flowing into the rest of the bathroom (photo attached)
Staff here are very nice I'll give them that but poorly trained, feels like this is a place for interns or rejects from Sheraton/Shangri la, huge let down.
If you are looking for white sand beach then this is not the place, no beach whatsoever unless you count that janky lip around the tip of this hotel.
Lastly, food here is average, not bad but then again if you are going to call yourself 5 stars then get it right. We tried the sports bar restaurant, no different than an outback steakhouse kind of vibe.
The Thai restaurant was decent so I'd go there if you are desperate and don't want to travel out.
Reminder, this place is a bit remote so don't expect to go outside the hotel area by foot and expect a ton of local restaurants around you, that's not the case.

Agoda,758055858,"A few relevant comments pertaining to the ratings:
LOCATION: 1* 
Mactan is not really an attractive vacation spot by itself, we picked it due to a late booking at the prime time of the year. Poor infrastructure, and the wreck of a stranded cargoship near the hotel facility do not precisely improve on that perception.

HOTEL: 4* 
Relatively good value for money even after considering the peak season pricing. 
Our room had sea-view and was impeccably clean. The utilities worked flawlessly.

FACILITIES (Pool, restaurants, bars, and games): 5* 
The pool is particularly well designed, spacious and clean. Restaurants and bars serve a wide range of food, even for discerning tastes.
A pool-table and foosball round off the excellent leisure facilities.

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
(1) A compulsory gala dinner on the new year’s eve is understandable (for planning purpose), yet a basic allowance of alcohol like a glass of wine and a beer per person would have advisable and considerate, given the premium price tag. More disturbing than the charge itself, was the need to pop out the purse and pay for every serving, which disturbed the celebrations.
(2) The second nuisance on which management didn’t act even after strong complaints by several guests, was the faux “reservation” of pool-loungers by hotel guests who were not present. Incidentally, we observed how 2 loungers were blocked with pool-towels for 5 hours (9:00 AM – 2:00 PM) by a couple. Then they showed up for just 30 minutes and left again. It is beyond comprehension why the lifeguard hands out towels to people who immediately leave, after block-dropping them on a scarce number of loungers, and why the hotel management tolerates this practice to the detriment of all other guests.

My husband also got the worst food poisoning from the sandwich bought at the deli. They probably make it and leave it there for days.

The room ambiance is like staying in a barely 3 star hotel, air conditioning was not working. Did not expect this for a supposed 5-star hotel. Yes the infinity pool is great, the view of Cebu island is great but that is just it, you can get better experience with cheaper or same rate with nearby hotels. The BBQ night food and breakfast were normal nothing special. Overall I will never stay in this hotel again.

Agoda,659726775,"We arrived late at night, and the boy reluctantly helped us with our bags. We got a room in building 1 that had an ugly view. We fell asleep to the sound of pumping bass in the distance. Woke up much before we wanted to to the sounds of construction outside our window. It was Sunday morning. Requested a room change and they moved us to building 2, but only late afternoon, after 3:30pm. When we tried to nap in our original room our earplugs couldn't block the construction noise completely.  Once we moved, everything changed, it felt like a different resort. We booked this hotel for a reliable landing in the Philippines and that is exactly what we didn't get. Besides for the night staff and the dark-energy Edmund at the omelette station, the staff was generally great.  Facilities were nice, but lacking diversity of offerings: this place is all about the pool, and it is a very nice pool. Meals were fine.  We also encountered loud construction noise at the Thai restaurant at 8pm. I can't recommend because the experience is not reliable.

Agoda,633439223,"We went to de-stress but upon check-in, our stress piled up. It took them more than an hour to check us in and giving us reason that room availability was an issue.  so I said if that is the case you should reach out to your guests as check in time is 2pm and we check in past 5pm. When I said I want my money back so I can check on another hotel, the room became available. The room they gave us was not the room we booked - 2 Single Bed. And to top it, there was no “main door” on the bathroom, block out curtain was not functional and so was the WiFi. Since we were so tired to have dinner in their restaurant, we ordered room service. And again, it took them more than an hour to deliver the food and when I complained the staff said “I’ll give u a complimentary juice”. Of course I said “no thank you!” Our expectation is better service bec we paid much.
I was so pissed when I woke up the following morning bec the sun was going to our room and woke us all early. So called them and demanded that we be transferred to another room. They did transfer  us and I asked them why they were not able to give us better rooms when we checked in when the hotel was not even fully booked. So I asked the reception staff that I want to talk to the manager or supervisor to complain all the inconvenience we are experiencing. And she said no manager but will asked the supervisor to call us. Guess what, no calls.  
And one more thing I notice is that they seem to treat the foreign guests better than the local guests. This was particularly obvious to me when we went to the Thai Restaurant. We were told that only reservations allowed but when I insisted they gave us a table.

Our bathroom flooded after 2 mins in the shower. At one point, my friend slipped because the water did not dry up after several hours of waiting. We ended up wasting a lot of time in the room waiting for the issue to be resolved. It’s hard to believe that this is the standard of rooms at such an extravagantly priced hotel.

Agoda,579086974,"My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at Dusit Thani Cebu and it was a wonderful experience overall. The general manager, Mike Kempf, was very responsive to feedback and took the time to make sure that our stay was as enjoyable as possible. The suite room was spacious and had all the amenities we needed, including universal plugs and USB ports, which made it easy to use and charge our electronic devices.

The pool at the hotel was a highlight of our stay - it was beautifully maintained and the perfect place to relax and cool off. The beach was small but peaceful, with clear waters that were perfect for swimming. We also had the opportunity to try the food at the hotel's speciality Thai restaurant, and it was absolutely divine. The Executive Chef, Chef Karthik Ravi, was also very helpful in making sure that our family had meals that met our dietary requirements.

The children especially loved the ""Fun Zone"" kids play area and spent hours there every day. The staff at the hotel were generally friendly and courteous, and we had a wonderful time at the New Year's Eve party where we were seated with the general manager and his family to bring in 2023.

There were a few areas where the hotel could make improvements to enhance the guest experience. For example, the Sunset Bar could be more efficient in taking and filling orders, which would likely increase food and drink sales. It would also be beneficial to have a wider selection of cuisine, particularly for those following a vegetarian diet, and to review the in-room dining process to ensure that hot food is delivered. Additionally, an expanded menu with a variety of options to cater to different palettes would be welcome.

- For the prices we were paying, you'd think breakfast was included, but nope, you had to pay for it. I would've appreciated a 'lower-tier' set breakfast instead of a buffet for what we were paying for the overnight stay, but it was either a buffet breakfast or none at all. And since they still couldn't charge the room, I had to yet again go back to my room to get my credit card.

Oh, the beach isn't totally something to write home about. Plus there's a beached ship that hasn't been removed yet.

For the prices we were paying, I'd probably skip them and go to the Shangri-La instead.

Agoda,567734884,"Hell of a good location and place!! Staff was really friendly! Was accommodated well. Also the hotel had a good view! 

BUT.. 
1.  When we were eating/drinking at the bar (3 occassions during our trip) Our experience with the service was terrible ): DO NOT get me wrong; the staff was super nice!! However, for our experience, it took us atleast 15-20 minutes to get only two drinks every time we dined in. I'm not sure if they were short staffed which is understandable if they were. But they weren't even busy and not much customers were there during that time.

Then, when it came to ordering  food (bar area again), it took more than 30 minutes. I ordered the pizza, and it arrived cold. I didn't want to complain because I was already tipsy and having a good time haha. Didn't want to ruin the vibe.
Being a 5-star hotel, this part was sad.

2. If the pool did not close so early (8pm), it would have been perfect ): After our tours which lasted during the day, it ends and we get dropped off back to the hotel around 7:30/8pm. Wish they closed at 10 So we can relax at the pool after getting a tour ):

3. the wifi was REALLY terrible. I couldn't connect to it in the hotel room.  I couldn't access to yotube through the TV

4. At times, when I contact front desk/concierge for something, they don't answer.  However, when I went downstairs to the lobby, they were talking to other guests. it seems that they are short staffed.

5. The thai restaurant closes earlier than the time it was supposed to be! ):

Overall, still a great experience.
Not going to give this 1 star because I know they can improve on this :) Hopefully, they will see my review!

4. They should have a certain portion in their resto where they can accommodate people who have already gone for swim and would like to take thw breakfast in between since there are really guests who would dip the pool as early as 7am and takes breakfast late. Its very inconvenient to go to the room and change then after breakfast change again. If other resorts have managed to do that, there's no reason you can't.

This means that you are forced to sit on uncomfortable bean bags next to the pool, with the mosquitoes. I was spending far in excess of the cost of the buffet, but they still insisted that we move out the restaurant to a cramped bar area (there were 7 of us) or sit outside by the side of the pool.

The impact of the monsoon to the roof is unfortunate, but the ""infinity"" pool and view were the saving grace. Was given an ""upgraded"" room with view to the junkyard behind. The provision in the room were basic, for a ? Star hotel. I would rather pay a little more for another hotel nearby?

No slippers were provided and nobody was answering the phone (operator, housekeeping

We had to ask 3 times for coffee as there were no cups available, we only got our coffee when we were about to finish our meal. Bed and covers were comfy though and staff were generally nice when asked, just that nobody was answering our calls. The pool is nice as it overlooks the ocean with lots of chairs to lounge on.

Agoda,518070262,"In my personal opinion the hotel is just that too far out of the way from attractions and places to go! If you want a few days away with just a pool, restaurant, gym and other normal hotel facilities then yes a good place to visit. If you want to move away from the hotel then it will cost you a fortune in taxi’s to get around. If you hire a car you will spend most of your time in traffic. We hired a scooter and found that the best way to get around though a little dangerous as the roads are pretty scary with lack of road discipline from other road users.
We had to ask reception to have the room cleaned daily even though there was a make my room illuminated sign to notify the housekeeping staff you wanted the room made up..
Facilities in general were good, Infiniti  pool was great, gym was good and the restaurants also good. When we stayed breakfast was in different restaurant locations within the hotel and sometimes buffet and other time A La cart, choice of food for breakfast was ok but could have been better with a wider choice of offerings.
We had a Delux sea view room which was great and spacious with the usual amenities you would expect from a Dusit Thani property . Staff were great and always pleasant and helpful.

Nevertheless, overall it was an excellent stay and most things were at typical Dusit standards.

We were tired and exhausted by then - it was a hot, humid day and instead of being able to spend a few hours relaxing we had to be bitten by mosquitoes while waiting in the lobby.  The staff did say we could enjoy facilities, however we just really wanted our room to rest on thay day.

We took our lunch at the sports bar and waited. It took me more than 5 follow-ups before we were able to get to our room. Fellow travelers checking in that day also had the same experience. Worse, when we got to our room at first, it was not prepared yet - miscommunication, they gave room 3101 instead of 3501. 

We understand it was a peak holiday. There were lots of free rooms, but they weren't cleaned yet. As a suggestion, the resort can hire extra help to do cleaning on days like these. Our room's bathroom was moldy, far what I expect from a 5star.

They did allow us to check out late. Lucky our flight back to Manila was late, but how about those with early flights? 

Nevertheless, the resort's facilities such as the pool is superb. I also like the sports bar staff, they were great. To the front desk's credit, they were courteous and respectful all along.

Agoda,491392275,"I had high expectations of this trip simply with the amount of money shelled out for our accommodations unfortunately, it was as if I was staying at a relatively low-end hotel facility.

With the exception of the 100M swimming pool and the view of the beach, everything else from the food served (whether paid or part of the room package), the “club room”, the service and the generally warmth and welcoming demeanor of the staff was not there.

It is understandable that the hotel was still going through restoration as an aftermath of the typhoon last December but why open and operate almost 180-rooms if the service is sub-par. Why use the typhoon as a reason for the poor experience every paying customer have to go through? Definitely unacceptable especially if you’re a full-paying customer.

Anyway, I don’t mind going all the way to the end of Mactan for the use of the pool but you will never catch me staying at this hotel again unless things will drastically improve

Agoda,484993014,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 
The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness.
The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entree's though need to have more variety. Benjarong was closed when we were there due to repairs. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom where we were though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

Over-all rating -- 3.5 to 4

Even I lost my iphone charger from moving 1 room to another and she returned it to me safely packed and tidy. She had an absolute best performance that we could not thank her enough. We made sure we all have checked out from the hotel all good, spent more time with the local family, and flew back to Australia  safe and sound.

The pool is enormous and beautifully laid out. We also really enjoyed walking the grounds below the pool where they have ample seating to look out over the water, volleyball and badminton. It’s a great place for a morning or evening stroll.

We were busy most days enjoying the hotel, so ordered room service for dinner. It arrived promptly and the food was good. I appreciated that room service was available via a QR code on the menu.

One of the most perfect vacations we ever had. Thank you to Karen for the warm welcome and for going over and beyond what we expected. Our room was truly 5 star with sheets, pillows and a bed that smelled of freshly washed linens. Felt like sleeping in clouds. Our room faced the water- end to end. A view that was breathtaking as it was serene and soulful. I would go here again for this view. There was no sunset view bec it was a cloudy day. Nevertheless the view was majestic and stunning.

I don’t like swimming in public pools but Dusit’s stunning pool beckoned and I’m glad I went ahead bec the water was as it should be. I could do laps without goggles and not going half blind from chlorine. There was no chlorine smell in fact but water was clear and clean and so inviting. Don’t miss it like I almost did. 

I also don’t enjoy buffets too much but I’m glad my husband and I did the Seafood Market buffet for dinner. It must have been one of the best buffets in my life. The staff in Dusit were warm- from Karen to Leo to Kris. Not too much the chubby gay guy who dances the tinikling and pretended he didn’t know I wanted to try it out and had a dance concert to himself. A small annoyance that hasn’t marred our stay there. 

The free ride to Nustar was a superb add on. Thank you Dusit Cebu for a most magical time you gave me and my husband. We will be back with our kids. 

PS  I hope Dusit engages the community it finds itself in and that it becomes a force for social justice and progress.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun. 

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience. 

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep.

But these are the things we are disappointed & frustateted about: the unlimited drinks they suggested to us to pay extra to have an «unlimited»  access drinks ( alcoholic drinks not included) is not worth  the 1,400 per person. We were there at 11 am and the fruits shakes were not availble already. We booked days before for a 12 nn lunch at their sunset day bar restaurant but the last order for the crispy pata is already closed? Like what?  Really? Cant believe it. Just sat down and we cant order whats in the menu. This bar restaurant is  super hot, not lucky if you seated on a table without a fan above , loud , noisy , not enough ventilation. We waited long for our food. The Surf & Turf platter is not worth its price & honestly not that good. Letchon kawali pica pica is ok. 

Then we decided to use its pool, but we werent allowed to use our unlimited drinks access at the pool, they wanted us to order our drinks from the sunset bar, because the access is only at the view lounge infront of the bar because the pool is in front of the bar restautant & its not allowed. so Whats the point of paying the unlimited access then? But then foreigners were allowed.  So we ended up talking to a staff, and then finally allowed us . Why? 

Hotel staff at the view lounge & bar/restaurant werent pleasant to us generally as well. We may look not good but we are customers & we expected a just service especially in an international hotel brand. Never experienced this on other hotels yet. 

Kudos though to the Staffs at the breakfast lounge, entrance & room staffs.  They were very helpful, Nice & accomodating to our big family.

We used Dusit Thani as a “hub” for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.

,949431814,"Two nights into a 6 night stay. Let me begin by saying this review is from an Australian point of view which puts me in a minority in regard to guests. The hotel itself is lovely and offers a beautiful view, the staff are friendly and the pool is large. The resort is best suited to people who enjoy staying at the resort the entire time as there is nothing around the resort, no mini mart, no restaurants, no shopping… Everything is a 10 minute drive away. The main things we struggled with staying at DT were:
-
No mini mart - it cost us $20 for 4 small cans of tonic water at the hotel. There is literally no where nearby to purchase water / supplies so you have to purchase at the hotel. 
-
The breakfast buffet although large caters mainly towards Asian guests.  I selected the baked beans (lukewarm) hash brown (still frozen in the middle) and a fried egg (that I had to wait 15 minutes for)
-
Drink service by the pool is slow, 2 beers will take anywhere between 15 to 20 minutes. Prices are high but then again I understand we are in a resort and prices are always going to be high. Staff are friendly but you have to get their attention otherwise you don’t get served.
-
No one informed us of what was happening around the resort- we had no idea if it was bbq night, dj night etc as there is no communication with guests.
-
Dusit Club. It served its purpose. Only downside was the cold meat and cheeses sitting directly under a light resulting in it all to sweat which wasn’t appealing and again, food was cold by the time it was served. Drinks are also very slow… 
-
This is more about Cebu than the resort…..
Beach at Dusit Thani is pebbly so shoes are necessary.
Roosters next to resort are very noisy in the morning.
Good Restaurant/Bar options  appear limited unless you go to other resorts which you have to get a taxi too and of course pay resort prices.

Overall Dusit Thani is a lovely resort that I would recommend to traveler’s that are looking for a resort holiday destination. If you like somewhere close to everything this isn’t the place for you.

The Rooms are okay with a nice sea view. 
The sunset sports bar is all wrong. There's nothing sporting about it apart from the staff wearing what looks like an unflattering newcastle football strip. 
This could be a much more romantic bar and probably should be located further down near the seaside. 
Don't bother with the regular barbecue evening down on the boardwalk. It is actually a buffet with some poor cuts of meat and few prawns and bits of fish which are actually barbecued. I expected to see rows of barbecue. The food is much fresher in the food court in mactan newtown then on this barbecue! 
The thai restaurant caters for people who don't really like thai food i think because there is very little spice. Maybe optimized for western customers. 

Breakfast is okay if you like pickled egg and dried fish and a lots of other unidentifiable korean and asian foods, but for a westerner you can just about get your hands on some toast and eggs. There is no bacon and overall not a great  breakfast unless you are as the majority here of course asian.

Rating: 5/5

My recent stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu was an absolute delight from start to finish. The room was not only spacious and elegantly designed, but it also boasted one of the fluffiest pillows I’ve ever had the pleasure of resting my head on.

However, the comfort didn’t end there. The resort’s beach and long pool area provided the perfect backdrop for relaxation and rejuvenation. Whether I was soaking up the sun on the pristine beach or lounging by the expansive pool, every moment was pure bliss.

After a day of leisurely activities, returning to my room felt like coming home to a sanctuary of comfort and tranquility. The plush bedding, coupled with the heavenly pillow, ensured a restful night’s sleep like no other.

Our lunch at Sunset Sports Bar, was unforgettable! Angel, our server, She was exceptional, Kudos to Her! We savored a delightful 5 cheese pizza and spicy Korean wings with hummus, each dish bursting with flavor.

In conclusion, if you’re looking for a luxurious stay with exceptional comfort, look no further than Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu.

But I have to say one flaw about this Mactan Cebu Dusit is extremely humid in the hotel room and it seems there is air-con ventilation issue. Our room floor was very wet with humidity and the bathroom became very slippery. The room got extremely moldy smell and I could not breath well in the room. Luckily I booked for one night only. 
We tried to set the ""Heat"" function on the air-con before going out for dinner then the humid and watery on the floor were gone when we were back to the room after 2 hours. But the moldy smell was still there.

,936701036,"After spending 6 nights in this resort, we left, unfortunately, not too satisfied. The hotel has a beautiful atrium, the swimming pool is immaculately maintained, and the staff is extremely friendly and always ready to help. And that is what we would praise without reservation. Breakfast is rich in choice, but it is recommended to arrive as early as possible because after 8 o'clock the breakfast room gets very crowded and there are no free tables available.
The room (deluxe sea view) was clean, but it needs a complete renovation: the furniture has been corroded by time, the bathroom also cries out for a complete renovation, and the aircon was set to the minimum when we arrived, so we felt like we were in a refrigerator. When the aircon is not working, there is a stale smell in the room, but luckily we had pleasant weather, so we could air it out on the open balcony.
Beach practically does not exist.
 The location of the hotel is ideal for someone who does not want to move during their stay, but otherwise be sure to be aware that walking outside the resort is not recommended.
Luckily for us, we went on trips most of the time. 
 Always use only Grab! During our stay, we exclusively used Grab, but when checking out, the staff near the reception kindly offered to order us a taxi. Big mistake, our mistake for naively accepting it. Instead of the approx. 300 php we paid for Grab from the airport to the Dusit Thani, on departure, from Dusit Thani to the airport, we paid double! For the same way! It's a shame for the hotel that they hire a taxi driver as their co-worker, who complains all the way that he has five children, how it's his birthday today and that he has no money, and at the end, when he brought us to the airport, he asks us how much we're willing to pay him!? ! We offered him 500 php just to get rid of him as soon as possible but he also demanded 100 php for taxi ordering services for Dusit Thani hotel staff. It's terrible, really terrible that the hotel management tolerates such a thing and certainly knows about it.
 On the resort's website, it is stated that money can be changed at the reception, but it is not stated that they only change US dollars. They not exchange euros. This can be very annoying if you don't have enough pesos for a taxi to the nearest exchange office.
 All in all, this is far from the luxury resort they advertise.",2.0,2024-02-03,0.25,dusit_thani_mactan,spend night resort leave unfortunately satisfy hotel beautiful atrium swim pool immaculately maintain staff extremely friendly always ready help would praise without reservation breakfast rich choice recommend arrive early possible oclock breakfast room get crowd free table available room deluxe sea view clean need complete renovation furniture corrode time bathroom also cry complete renovation aircon set minimum arrive felt like refrigerator aircon work stale smell room luckily pleasant weather could air open balcony beach practically exist location hotel ideal someone want move stay otherwise sure aware walk outside resort recommend luckily u go trip time always use grab stay exclusively use grab check staff near reception kindly offer order u taxi big mistake mistake naively accept instead approx php pay grab airport dusit thani departure dusit thani airport pay double way shame hotel hire taxi driver coworker complain way five child birthday today money end bring u airport ask u much will pay offer php get rid soon possible also demand php taxi order service dusit thani hotel staff terrible really terrible hotel management tolerate thing certainly know resort website state money change reception state change u dollar exchange euro annoy dont enough peso taxi nearest exchange office far luxury resort advertise,0
,936503930,"We stayed for 5 nights. This was the first out of 4 hotels we stayed at whilst in the Phillipines. 
Pros
Emails before travel all answered promptly. 
All the staff (and there are lots of staff) are brilliant.
Very well looked after clean hotel.
Close to the airport and hotel arranged transfer.
Fast check in.
Location is beautiful. Sea facing room is a must.
Bed and room large. Bed was very comfortable.
The lounge is a nice touch with nibbles and cocktails and high tea included in club room prices.
Concierge will arrange trips for you. The cocktails where awesome and made correctly (the next hotel I travelled to didn't have a clue how to make cocktails), well done for awesome margarita's and Singapore slings. The red wine was nice at the club lounge. 
Everything you could possibly need in the room, including iron, ironing board, umbrella, scales, hair dryer, large fridge, extra duvet, toothbrushes, robes, slippers and toiletries etc and lots of storage space. The shower pressure is excellent.
Breakfast is excellent with lots of choice (it was the best we had while travelling in the Phillipines). Last walk in is 10.15am for breakfast, this not mentioned and witnessed one lady bring turned away, even though it wasn't 10.30.
A breakfast and coffee take out was offered when we went on an early morning trip (excellent service, other hotels did not offer this).
The pool is lovely with great views. Never had any issues with getting a sunbed.
The sports bar has free pool, darts, beer pong and fuse ball. 
The television wasn't working in our room, but we told our house keeping and this was immediately fixed by him.
The concierge, Jade, went above and beyond for us. He arranged our taxi to the port and even arranged our transfer from the port to the next hotel (we'd emailed our next hotel, but no reply).
The WiFi was good. 

Other
Nothing around hotel to walk to; but if you want to venture out a taxi can be called, experiences/trips arranged or there's a free shuttle (we didn't use the shuttle). 
The club longue ran out of both red and sparkling wine on separate occasions.
The condensation in the room makes the floors slippy. There is some advice regarding  keeping the balcony door closed to help with this in the room. We put towels on the floor when it was needed. 
The only improvement for a 5 star plus review would be, to be greeted with cold face towels and a complementary drink on arrival. 

Overall
If I was coming back to Cebu I would stay here again to rest after a long flight and before my onward journey, but I would need a club sea facing room again. An excellent hotel with everything you could possibly need.

,934554941,"I was expecting so much from this hotel but left feeling like I wasted my money. The only two things I can appreciate from this place is the friendly and professional staffs and their sunset view. But that's just it! 

I'd say breakfast was not that bad, but the other meals I had from this place was so underwhelming and awful. I'd suggest you eat out and enjoy your food elsewhere. I was excited to be in Cebu for the first time and not once do they even have their famous lechon here. 

I added on a package to include high tea and evening cocktails at their club lounge and it was so depressing there.. Their ambiance was gloomy, food was horrible, drinks I'd say was ok. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it. 

Phone line and TV cable at one point was not working! For a 5 star hotel, surely this is not the kind of experience they expect their guests to have. 

There's so many details this hotel is missing and I wish they improve on this. Sunbed was not comfortable, there was no comb available in the room ( you'd need to call and ask), no bath salts (even though they provide a tub), you'd need to pay extra to avail the kids playroom, and maybe I'm just nit picking here but the hotel doesn't smell nice.

,932830535,"A great hotel, overlooking the sea, with fantastic staff and great food. The rooms are a good size and very clean. Swimming pool is a great feature of the hotel, with the only challenge being that their are not enough sun beds for all of the guests and so we had to get up by 7am each morning to get a bed. Most of the beds are also fixed in a sitting position and very uncomfortable and without any mattresses. Didn't expect this for the standard of the hotel and the cost and  it did negatively impact our stay and many other guest complained. On a more positive note, the entertainment provided is great fun and the local dive school, Scotty's, is very highly recommended and they have a desk in reception.

I’m shocked that amenities provided needs extra payment (such as kids playground, hotels bikes..etc) Food is the weakest item, the breakfast is average but lunch buffet and New Year dinner was a disaster in my point of view! Staff always tried to be accommodating and trying their best to please.. but I think closing all restaurants in hotels to force hotel guests to pay for New Year’s eve dinner 6500pesos each(no drinks included) and provide poor quality was a rip off..

,920301320,"I had the opportunity to revisit Dusit Thani Mactan on October 7, 2023, just yesterday, and I was pleasantly surprised by the enhancements or improvement made to the facilities.

When we entered the hotel, the usher was friendly and helpful, although I forgot to check her name tag. She guided us to the front desk with a lovely smile, so acccomodating, assisting us all our needs. All the staff members you encounter are wearing smiles and warmly greet you.

Joshua, the friendly attendant at the towel station, was just as cheerful and accommodating as we headed to the pool for the kids' swim. I also observed him participating alongside Judy Ann during the Zumba dance exercise.

Twice a day, there was a Zumba dance session led by a girl named Judy Ann, who exhibited remarkable enthusiasm even under the sun's heat. Surprisingly, I also spotted her managing the Kids play zone. She's truly a valuable asset!

The lifeguards remained highly vigilant, evident from the occasional loud whistles I heard. This underscores the establishment's commitment to prioritizing safety and security, a significant factor in their operations.

It was also delightful to see our cultural dance, the tinikling, being performed with such excellence and also the I love Cebu theme! 

At noon, we enjoyed a delicious buffet lunch, and all the dishes were exceptionally tasty. Unlike my previous visit in June, they now offer ice cream for kids, which my children thoroughly enjoyed. He also loved the pumpkin soup. The food left both me and my friend completely satisfied and full.  The waiter, Norwin, served us very well too at the pool. 

After our lunch, my children chose to play in their kids' play zone and was pleasantly surprised by the significant improvements. In my previous experience, there was no one attending to the area, but now I noticed that it's always staffed. We met Denthor, who entertained us. I hope they will continue to maintain this level of supervision for the safety of the children. I'm thankful that the management took my previous comment seriously and took action. Kudos and thank you.

There were numerous activities available, and we were delighted to partake in each one. From playing Badminton to riding the kalesa, the hotel came to life with vibrant lights and music at sunset, adding to our enjoyment.

,918765951,"We loved our stay at Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu because the facilities and the service are world class. 

The facilities-- from the hotel room, bathroom, the restaurants, the manicured and well-maintained beachside pathways and lounge chairs with umbrellas, the big and small swimming pool -- were designed to give guests ultimate enjoyment in their vacation. The hotel staff are also very good, and they use their training to the best of their abilities to give the guests a great time at Dusit. Special mention goes to the following people who are very memorable because of the excellent guest service, their great personality and because they take time out to interact with us to make sure we were comfortable and we were enjoying ourselves -- Angelie and Min(the OJT) of the Trade Winds breakfast buffet, Teofy and Alvin of the Sunset Bar, Rome of the Benjarong Thai Restaurant and Shiela of the hotel lobby. 

I also enjoyed the aquarobics... The dance instructors are very athletic and very energized. Love them! Keep it up!

Lastly, some suggested areas for improvement: (1) when the room's shower is used, the water overflows to the entire floor space of the lavatory. Can this be resolved? We do not want slippery lavatory floors because it is a safety issue. You don't want guests to suffer an accident while at the hotel room. Putting the floor mat as a barrier is not enough because the mat gets soaked easily; (2) is the jetty always closed-off to the guests? it would be nice if it is open and can be the take-off point for boating or snorkeling..

,917624157,"From the minute we arrived and right throughout our stay to the minute we left all staff and management were all so
Beautiful made our 10 Day stay out of this world 

The resort and its facilities are a 10 out 10 and the huge difference is that staff and management are so respectful to anyone that comes to their establishment

The front desk and concierge staff are always looking out for you and the most helpful people and nothing was a problem to them. 

The breakfast buffet choice was widely spread and you could not leave without feeling full with the amount of food on offer and again every day everyone was greeted beautifully by the staff

If breakfast is included in your package - highly recommend- and you are booked on a early morning trip - the staff will pack you a nice take away breakfast 

Any speciality coffee like Cappuccino - lattes etc are part of the breakfast package unlike most other resorts 

The View Bar is exactly what it is as it has a spectacular view of the ocean and serves fantastic cocktails with highly skilled staff that make you feel like you are royalty

The sunset bar is a sports bar with darts pool table and karaoke with great lunches and dinners served is set just behind the infinity pool and is filled with fun staff dressed as referees is another place to enjoy 

The NAMM Spa is by far and large the most tranquil resort style spa with great masseurs that we would highly recommend their 2.5 hr package that includes body scrub - facial and massage

The 100 metre infinity pool is Devine with the ground staff always attending to the maintenance and upkeep of this huge pool but our favourite was the Rainforest Pool that is set with more shade and Bali Huts - that is so peaceful with the sound of the waterfall 

Our Ocean Room #3511 had everything that you could ask for with the fine detail of the housekeeping efforts that everyday made the room beautiful 

On top of that our room is a club room and the benefits that you get for these rooms is astounding with daily high teas - nightly cocktails with access the Club Room Lounge was a huge surprise and most appreciated gesture

The options from dinners you have on offer you never feel you need to leave this wonderful resort 

There are snack type meals available from the Sunset - beautiful BBQ’ over looking the infinity pool - weekends buffet at the Tradewinds (where breakfast is served) or dine at the Korean Restaurant or The signature Thai Restaurant 

Even though we didn’t use these facilities but this resort has an absolutely amazing Kids indoor air conditioned play centre and a well equipped gym situated in complete privacy 

The grounds and maintenance to the property are continually being looked after in a very discreet way

The resort has so much to offer and the staff and management is the place to come and stay when next in the Philippines - we will be coming back and bringing our family members with us

,917545226,"Our recent stay was excellent and we will surely be coming back! All staff were very courteous--- lifeguards, gardeners, engineers, cleaners, room attendants, waiters, you name it! Room attendants Jay, Den, Maria, and Dindo left us a heart-warming note in our room after cleaning. They did a job well-done! We made sure to leave a tip.

Breakfast buffet was huge and big-time! Choices were amazing! They have improved since March 2023 --but bacons are no longer on display so just make sure to ask the staff. We were taken care of by the Tradewinds cafe staff like Mary (always brought me bacon yayyy) and Kriz (he made us refreshing watermelon juice!). We enjoyed the Saturday night seafood buffet at the Tradewinds too with my family and tried the Cabana nights next to the pool with my friends whom I have invited over (for 1500 it was reasonably priced!). Sunset Bar's bao buns were a sure winner and a must-try. The Deli's gelato was one of our faves too! 

The Rami restaurant is a great addition to your hotel should other customers try a different kind of cuisine (Korean food) and I did love the beef bulgogi I ordered. We think Rami is not under the ownership of Dusit Thani but just wanted to tell other potential customers that they should try this resto too as their food was good and their staff were also very nice--- every time we passed by they would say Hi and Hello, just like how the whole staff of Dusit Thani were. Our experience at the Benjarong restaurant was also exceptional. 

Bed was huge and comfortable. Pillows were heavenly soft. Balcony was spacious and definitely a great addition to the room we booked because we always woke up to a very relaxing sea view every morning! Only wish is I hope you retained the Damana brand for shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, and cleansing gel (what we originally had in March 2023). The recent ones we had now in September 2023 changed to generic-looking toiletries. It's a 5-star hotel, we would expect the packaging could be a little more top-tier.

I also had fun with the kalesa ride last Saturday as part of the hotel's weekend activity. The horse driver/owner even offered us to drive the kalesa with his supervision. Got to talk to him a bit and glad to hear that the hotel employs him on Saturdays. We also saw him enjoy the feast during the seafood buffet. The hotel truly employs and rewards them like their own customers. I also got to witness the world clean up day on Monday and Dusit Thani gave the people who did the cleaning with free food. Truly nice of them.

Special thanks to Enan and Niki! We met them originally in March during our first stay and our 2nd stay this month in September again.Nice to see familiar faces working indeed!

We also visited 2 competitor 5-star hotels nearby during our 7-day stay in Dusit Thani and so far we loved Dusit Thani's layout of the restaurant, pool, and the huge wide-open well-ventilated reception and hotel lobby area. Everything was perfectly situated. You can order food and drinks while at the pool. Or if you're just dining at the Sunset bar you can see the the whole view of the pool and the overlooking sea from behind. Other competitor hotels' facilities were just out of place, in our own opinion.

Other thing I just want to add is most taxi drivers really want us to add a bit $ on top of the meter once they know we are headed to this hotel. Once you are at the hotel, you will understand why. It's because you are almost at the tip or the Mactan Island and the drivers could hardly catch the next passenger as they will have to go back to the main roads of Lapu-Lapu to get the next one. I know it beyond the control of the hotel already. Staff at the lobby makes sure that they disclose there is an additional 100 pesos fare on top of the meter if you ride FROM the hotel. Hotel also gives you a taxi slip before you go (you can always contact LTFRB should you have any issues with the taxi drivers). The attitude of the drivers do not in any way reflect the hotel since that is already beyond the control of Dusit Thani. Just report the incident after you have left the taxi.

*** I know stray dogs and cats are not allowed in the property but my partner and I are animal lovers and we wished to have seen the same animals we saw in March but I don't see them anymore. I hope the animals are all okay and the management does no harm to them 🙏

We highly recommend Dusit Thani if you're a family, couple, or a solo traveler. Book the one with the sea view and you will NOT regret it.

With love,

Bath towels seem like beach towels, they were too big. We were told that our rooms have king sized beds, there were twin beds.

,897415931,"I recently had the opportunity to check out this esteemed hotel last week, and I am writing to share my concerns regarding the kids' play area. Unfortunately, my experience in that area was quite disappointing due to the absence of an attendant or staff member.

As a parent, I believe it is crucial to have dedicated personnel supervising and ensuring the safety of children in play zones. However, during my stay, I noticed that the kids' play area consistently lacked any staff presence. This lack of supervision raised several concerns for me.

Firstly, without an attendant, there was a significant risk of unruly behavior among children. I witnessed instances where children were left unsupervised, which resulted in disruptive and unsafe activities. This not only compromised the experience of other children but also posed potential hazards.

Additionally, the absence of an attendant raised concerns about the overall safety of the play area. Accidents can occur unexpectedly, and it is essential to have trained individuals who can promptly respond to any mishaps or injuries. The lack of a dedicated staff member made me question the level of priority given to the well-being of children utilizing the facility.

To address this issue, and if I may recommend that this hotel will consider employing an attendant specifically for the kids' play area. This staff member could ensure the orderly conduct of children, provide guidance when necessary, and be responsible for maintaining a safe environment. 

I must note that aside from this particular concern, I did find other aspects of possible staying at this hotel satisfactory. The ambiance is so relaxing and serene as noticed. However, the absence of an attendant at the kids' play area significantly affected my overall impression of the hotel.

I genuinely hope that the management will take my feedback into consideration and make the necessary improvements to enhance the experience for future guests. Having a well-supervised and safe kids' play area is vital for families who choose your establishment.

I trust that the management will take the necessary steps to address this concern and ensure a more enjoyable experience for families visiting this hotel.",1.0,2023-06-24,0.0,dusit_thani_mactan,recently opportunity check esteem hotel last week write share concern regard kid play area unfortunately experience area quite disappoint due absence attendant staff member parent believe crucial dedicate personnel supervise ensure safety child play zone however stay notice kid play area consistently lack staff presence lack supervision raise several concern firstly without attendant significant risk unruly behavior among child witness instance child leave unsupervised result disruptive unsafe activity compromise experience child also pose potential hazard additionally absence attendant raise concern overall safety play area accident occur unexpectedly essential train individual promptly respond mishap injury lack dedicate staff member make question level priority give wellbeing child utilize facility address issue may recommend hotel consider employ attendant specifically kid play area staff member could ensure orderly conduct child provide guidance necessary responsible maintain safe environment must note aside particular concern find aspect possible stay hotel satisfactory ambiance relax serene notice however absence attendant kid play area significantly affect overall impression hotel genuinely hope management take feedback consideration make necessary improvement enhance experience future guest wellsupervised safe kid play area vital family choose establishment trust management take necessary step address concern ensure enjoyable experience family visit hotel,0

Since am not really fun of that as i got plenty near my home i prefer beach sand where i do like longer barefoot walk.
Also to note during my visit at the little portion where you can supposedly swim i was dissapointed too as loads of garbage floating around where management could have put 2 meters net under the float they put around their area. So basically no chance of swimming again on the beach side.
So went to pool instead but to note its only 4 meters deep only good for shorter in height and kids.
So to that will be your swim around the hotel.

The heck was that its room rate inclusive. Only compensation is a movie costing 500 pesos only..

,894583178,"While most reviews are very good for this hotel I feel most are coming from locals that perhaps have not really experienced 5 star hotels in other countries. For a local this may be a great hotel but for me an International traveller it does not get past 3.5-4 stars at best.

Checkin was fine the hotel has a nice lobby and reception area. The room is quite small but at least clean.

This hotel is quite remote there is nothing but slums surrounding the hotel so there is really nowhere to go unless you drive. The hotel has a nice pool area however, it's packed with people and you feel like all eyes are on you when you're poolside. There are quite a few locals here with a day pass so the pool area is not exclusive to hotel guests. I ordered a pina colada at the poolside restaurant and was given a yellow drink. Aparently they had no coconut cream but if you dont have the key ingredient then don't serve it! They tried to correct the drink but to no avail.

Weeds are visible in green areas around the pool not what you would expect of a 5 star hotel. 

ANNOYING: You must pay everytime you eat or drink anything at all restaurants and bars becuase as the staff say we are renting this from the hotel so we need to charge you and you cannot add it to your room.
When I am on vacation i DO NOT WANT TO PAY everytime I eat or drink something this is truly unacceptable.

BAD: If you need wifi don't come to this hotel! I complained that it is very slow and keeps breaking up. A technician came to my room who tried his best but could not resolve the wifi issue.

The wifi is unstable and slow I could not do business here.

POOR: There is no International style buffet reastaurant. At least not during the week. Staff told me it's only open on Sat/Sun lunchtime. There is a thai, and korean restaurant but if you don't like that style of food you have very little choice.

I asked housekeeping for camomile tea and was given green tea.
I could hear bing bing bing.... non stop coming from housekeeping's phone to the point where I had to ask her to place her phone on silent.

The breakfast was good and service was fine.

All round unless you want to spend the whole day in the busy pool area you will be bored here. I felt it is overpriced and more expensive than the Sofitel in Manila while nowhere nearly as good. I would not consider coming back here again.

The food at Sunset Bar was relatively good, I highly recommend the the Angus Steak. Coffee preparation and presentation need to be improved (espresso-based preferred), and more a la carte dishes should be offered especially for solo travelers. I felt that Sunset Bar needed more variety especially if one plans to stay in the hotel for several days. 

Room Service was slow but the staff was very helpful. One thing I'd like to commend is that I genuinely felt the sincerity when the staff smiled and greeted me every morning. They were very hospitable and accommodating. I'd like to commend Norwin, Leo, and Janvie. I was mostly interacting with them during my stay, and they really excelled in customer service. 

Things to note: If you're looking at getting a tan, the pool is best from 8am-12nn. The beach is best reserved for reading and maybe some snorkeling (depending on the tide, weather, and the urchins). The beach unfortunately does not have fine sand, has a stony/rough sea bed with limited swimmable areas. SUP is offered as well for only P500++.

All of these restaurants serves good food. For the room, it has shower, hair dryer and built-in-cabinet with ironing board and iron. The gym also has a great sea view, so you can exercise while enjoying the sea view.

Besides the infinity pool, they also have the rainforest pool which is much smaller and perfect for kids. Expect a crowd on their infinity pool as it has the best view which is loved by the guests.

,885563977,"We've been there yesterday with my family (spouse and kid) and with a friend and her kid for Easter Egg Day Hunt. We we're looking for some decent property, not crowded that can accomodate our kids Easter Day experience. We are frequent travellers (local and abroad) and been here the 1st time. So we checked it out if it's worth a try. Me and my friend paid registration online and communicated via email and phone.

Pros:
1. Excellent property and breath taking view of the Mactan Channel.
2. Food is good.
3. Ample parking space.
4. F&B staff are good. Kudos Carlo from F&B
5. Security guys are nice.
6. Restrooms are within proximity 

Needs Improvement. 1 out of 5.
1. Lifeguards approached us more than 4 times different times, same issue
- We were initially told that pool towel is not applicable for Day Use (okay. Properties like Jpark, Plantation Bay, Bluewater, Crimson, Shang are not like this. So we thought your property, your rules.) 
- We will pay for extra adult that will swim to guard our kids while swimming but due to excess people in the Kid Zone they cant accomodate me and advised to go back later for payment. (We already made prepayment for our kids but never anticipated to pay for 1 adult, hence paying at the hotel) 
- I was asked for a receipt for the adult to swim. But hey, I was asked this question minutes I came from Kids Zone. I also approached front office to pay but referred me to another person.
 - We were told that pool use is included in the Easter Day Egg Hunt. 
- I asked the lady from Kid Zone reported this 2nd time and was told that lifeguards are monitoring guests for possible lost pool towels. (But hey! Why are we being singled out and being monitored?  For someone who is trying to enjoy the view, the experience. Your lifeguards assumed we are going to take your pool towels? Lol 
- Food menu QR 
- Our kids had fun with Easter Egg Day Hunt experience but needs improvement with execution
- After event, I approached the front office to pay for 1 adult for pool only use. Luckily I saw April from Kid Zone and paid the fee. (So why front office has to bounce me to another person if you can process my payment?) I've been passed around 3 times and your lack of coordination played a big role to our experience. 
- Some staff has this discrimination for local guests despite that we can afford all fees you impose us. Mind you, we are picky to resorts when we thought Dusit is one of them.

We might go back for check in and see the experience if it improves. I hope some of your staff will stop this discrimination to Filipino local guests.

,881993001,"Stayed for several nights in a club room.  Hotel itself is nice but very spread out.
I booked a club lounge room and emailed to let them know myself & daughter are coeliac and they confirmed back saying they could accomodate us with gluten free food. 
Unfortunately they didn’t rely this message to the club lounge so our first day all they could offer us was a salad- not good enough when I’m paying top dollar for a room.
The worst was when we left- they ordered a taxi for us to the airport- they told us it was metered.
I paid my outstanding bill (recipes kept).  It is a 30 min drive to the airport.  15 mins into the drive the taxi driver got a ph call.  He pulled off to the side of the road and started yelling at us that he had to turn around and we had to pay 400 pesos to the hotel.  The hotel were on speaker and were also yelling at us. I asked the driver to please drive as I have paid my bill and we would miss our flight.  After much yelling we started again only to have the hotel continually state we owed them money.  When we arrived to the airport the driver asked for more than double what the hotel said it would be.  I asked where the meter was- he said it was broken.  I said that’s not good enough the hotel said it was metered.  
He ended up slamming the boot door on my daughters arm- myself and my daughter were in tears at the airport.  This is simply not good enough from any hotel.

It was a bit hard to contact the hotel from the United States, but thankfully, Marejun got in touch with me through Whatsapp and did everything possible to assist me, from upgrading my room, and for the dining vouchers. It was very impressive. When we arrived at the resort, we were given a very warm welcome by the hotel staff. The check-in process was smooth, the bellman assisted us with our bags, and the young ladies brought us some goodies along with a handwritten letter from the General Manager. The room was spacious and was very clean. The toilet have complete amenities with a nice bathtub. It has a big balcony facing the bay and overlooking the City of Cebu. The whole resort was not crowded, so it's very ideal for those who want to have a tranquil vacation. We had our dinner on the first night at Benjarong. Kudos to our waiter Javier for a very personalized touch and for continuously checking on us. He and his team even sang a birthday song to my parents which I really appreciate. The Thai food choices were great! The next early morning, the hotel's ambience was very refreshing. The pool water was warm, and seriously, this was the best infinity pool I've ever seen, complete with loungers and cabanas with no extra cost. Overall, I rate our stay there as excellent, and I'd love to come back again. Hopefully, they would open the beach access very soon.

The pictures shoes the beautiful pool but there was a storm here some time back and with that a big container ship is stranded here and that was kind of cool to look at with a great story about the ship from the staff. The hotel staff was very accommodating and their bartender was top notch. The room was great and went well over our ecxpectations. However there was one thing I got disappointed by since this is a five star hotel and that was that they didn't bother cleaning the ice tray in our room but they did change it the moment I asked for it but still. That is when I noticed that this was a trend that kept coming. later they weren't quite ready with the evening activity that people had payed for. They set up the place wile we were all getting our welcome drinks and they weren't ready before maybe 30 min before midnight, they had done everything half way and uncoordinated. They had a fire show at the end but that was small and seemed unplanned since it looked like someone just practicing more then giving a show. She had a great technique its just not a performance yet but I think if she had time to plan then she could be great.
I hope they can fix this for next time since their venue deserved better as we visited a few hotels on this trip and this was the most luxurious venue we could see in Cebu.

,879689691,"Shout Outs:
The staff are kind, warm, and hardworking Seth (Deli) , Lovely (Deli), Ditchie (Sunset Bar), and Maria (Room Attendant) were beyond exceptional. If only the faciities, food, and front desk were as exceptional than this truly would be a 5 star hotel. 

Our Journey:

We choose Dusit Thani Cebu because we have stayed at numerous other properties throughout the world and have alywas found the service and accomdations truly superb.  Unforutnately I am not certian how this property is associated with the Dusit Thani Brand.  
  
Our group had  a total of three rooms booked which were all the Deluxe Rooms (the lowest category room).  Upon check in we were shocked at how small the rooms were (granted the size of the room is listed in the booking I did not pay attention assuming a 5 star hotel would only have reasonable sized rooms).   Beyond being smaller than expected all three of the rooms had significant problems (1) one of the rooms tv controller did not work and the television kept flickering (2) one of the rooms in the bathroom floor had no lip (which was not the case in 2 of the other rooms) which resulted in flooding when showering, (3) one of the rooms had several ants and (4) all of the air conditioning was very very weak (even after calling and having them serviced.  All these things were so bad I went down to the front desk to ask if we could cancel and move to a different hotel. Unfortunately, they said one of our bookings were prepaid and they could not give us a refund, but I could call Chase Ultimate rewards and ask for a refund of any non used days. I called immediatley and was told that Chase would need to ask the hotel and to call back later. Well the that next morning we had a tour booked to go to Olsob for Whale Shark Excursion (awesome you should do it) and when we came back  I went to talk to the front desk they upgraded us to club rooms, which was nice in size and the air conditioning worked!  Unfortunately on Tuesday and Wednesday the internet went from 150mbs down to 3 to 8mbs, which prevented me from being able to access my VPN for work (which was one of the reason I booked here for WIFI) it was like this durring the workday 9:00am-4:00pm.  i noticed durring my stay when the hotel is hosting a conference the internet becomes almost non usable for streaming videos or accessing  a VPN to conduct work is not possible. 

The rooms showers are also rather disgusting and I think re-caulking or deep cleaning the grout should be performed.  There is a serious lack of proper drainage which causes  part of the shower to become extremely slippery.

I've since booked another hotel even through I have a booking for 3 more nights (don't know if I will get refunded), because I can not stand the lack of true 5 star ammenities I've come to expect when staying at Dusit Thani properties.  I am hopeful the hotel will refund me the unused portion of my reservation and implment some improvements outlined below so they truly can become a 5 star facility. 

Recommendations to Management: 

*Have staff welcome guests upon check in and introduce themselves.  Have your front desk give an overview of the resturants and facilities. Also it would be nice for the staff to explain the big ugly boat ruining the view that guests paid top dollar to see and explain that even though one of the buildings is being worked on construction and noise will not be heard during the night. 

*Please ensure air conditioning in building 2 is working just as good as building 3, The difference is rather drastic. 

* I was asked 5 times in my stay to do a review on trip advisor even though on 3 of the conversations I said my stay was below expecations (maybe it was a language barrier), but I would train staff to apologize instead of asking for a review on trip adivsor. 

*In the breakfast buffet have staff fill coffee at the tables more frequently or make recommendations on some of the highlights of the buffet that day.  Also make sure the breakfast buffet serving utensils are placed properly. Two times  at 6:20am dishes were missing serving utensils. 

*Sunset bar service is slow. I am not sure if it is the kitchen or what, but the food time seems excessive.  Figure out a better way to stream line the process to increase the speed. 

*Research ways to prioritize or create seperate WIFI signals for guests and conference attendees so that service for hotel guests work the entire time.

*Better promotion of the special dinning events occuring at resturants. We were notified of the event last minute and could not attend.  The hotel should have access to booking emails and should send out any weekly events that coud be of interest. 

*Fix the lack of lippage in some of the rooms showers to ensure they do not continue to flood the entire bathroom floor.

Myself and my friend stayed at Dasit Thani Mactan for four nights in February and from the moment we checked in the standaed of service and kindness from the staff was next level. 
In particular Kris, Rolly and Rando at the sunset bar were always so welcoming and accomodating.

,877507693,"We arrived to our room and found it to be a room with a connecting door. This meant the family next door (despite not being very loud) could be heard clearly in our room. Outside the view was the car park and a scaffolding. We called reception and explained the situation and to be fair they moved us to a room without a connecting door.

The restaurant - We arrived back from a lovely trip and fancied some 5 star cuisine. We sat down and waited about 10 minutes (not too long so no problem) and nobody had come over. We went to retrieve the menu and poured our own water whilst we waited. After another 10 minutes, still no one had served us (again not a problem) so we went up to the bar and ordered. My main meal (a burger) came and I started eating and we thought the other meal would be a arriving soon, my partners (chicken adobo) did not arrive. Sometimes there is a delay so no problem. 35 minutes later her food had still not arrived. At this point no one had addressed us or mentioned the delay. We explained this to the staff and the waitress said “the kitchen was busy” which again, we understand. We just explained that it is nice to eat together and that for the price that is what we would also expect. We said to them don’t worry about the 2nd meal to which the manager then became involved and said they’d take the 2nd meal off the bill. Fair enough. The bill comes and there is a service charge? What service? I said there is a service charge here but we’ve not really had too much service, to which he said it’s included in the bill. Okay, no problem - paid it. 

Ironically, at most opportunities the waiters ask you to leave a trip advisor review explaining that you’ve had good service and they give you their name. A little scan me code appears on your table and then away you go writing your positive review. 

The gym - went to the gym to work off them meals that were not coming from the kitchen. Inside there was a party of about 12 people also using the gym. There was no one manning the desk and inside was an absolute circus. They were playing football with the yoga balls and had kids running around picking up the different gym equipment and in general, screaming. 

The water - each day you are stocked with two waters. They are shot size versions of waters. Fair enough they say if you need restocking that they will do this. We asked reception for more water (did not come) then asked room service via telephone for 4 waters to see us through the day. They knocked and brought two. If you want to clench your thirst, you will have job. 

Room service - We ordered sweet potato fries and chicken cesar wraps (total cost with service) 20 pounds. Nothing too unreasonable. However, the food was appalling. Would say it’s the worst room service I’ve ever had. 

All in all it is 2 or 3 star place dressed up as 5 star via the reviews they encourage you to make on the actual times when they should be bringing you your dinner. More time bringing dinner, less time asking for reviews.

We will get a response to this by someone who will say something along the lines of thanks for your feedback and we will look into this and try to improve. Well, you obviously don’t.

Additionally, because the hotel is so bad and they know it. They try to wash out all the negative reviews by getting the waiters to consistently ask for positive reviews and get you to name drop them. Which is why you’ll see most reviews saying I was served by “X” who gave me great service.

,875680834,"Please do not stay at this hotel.  Below is a list of all things we encountered in the first 12 hours of our stay:

1.  Don’t let the lobby or infinity pool fool you.  While these are very nice and well designed for the perfect Instagram or marketing photo, the rest of the hotel lacks any upgrades or detail

2. The Dusit does not believe in AC or even fans for any common areas or the sports bar making it very muggy

3. During our stay, the hotel was clearly understaffed catering to the Hyundai convention.  As a matter of business, they should be taken care of the best, however poor planning doesn’t mean the remains guests service should be sub par including bathrooms that had standing fluids on the floor for elongated periods of time 

4. Our check in was prompt, however there was only one attendant at the desk.  We booked through Expedia which may be why our deluxe room has windows that haven’t been cleaned in years and faces the garbage bins / parking lot 

5. Continuing with the rooms, the last renovation must have been completed  in the 90’s.  The cabinets and drawers are of poor quality / very old

6. Our shower (likely the most disturbing) hasn’t had a thorough cleaning in years.  The grout is severely discolored and something may be growing there. 

7. The beds have a thin mattress pad, however it can’t hid the uncomfortably hard mattress underneath 

8. The restaurants / dining experience had many flaws.  Again, likely due to the convention, many items had run out from mineral water to various food selections.  This again is simply poor planning where a chicken wrap should not take an hour with only 6-10 tables being utilized.  

10. Lastly, when we arrived, the pool was closed for water treatment.  Many of the marketing photos were of this pool that couldn’t be used as there doesn’t appear to be any beach access

I will point out that the wifi and breakfast were very good, however there were many smaller things, and likely more to come, not listed.

We tried to check-in at 2:30pm after standing in a long slow-moving line. We were told the room was not ready which was not a big deal since standard check in is 3pm. I specifically asked what time the room would be available and was told they were trying for before 3pm. Unlike at a true 5-star, they made no offer to contact me when the room was available so we just sat in the lobby. At 3:15 I got back in the long line at the front desk and finally reached it at 4pm. The story was now that the room would not be available until 5:30pm. If they told me 5:30 originally, we would have changed into our swimsuits and enjoyed the pool. I was offered a downgrade to a smaller size bed without a sea view which was declined. We accepted the offer to wait in the lounge with free snacks and drinks . Around 5pm a staff member sought us out in the lounge to notify us that our room was available and we needed to go to front desk for our keys.  If they are going to take the time to find us, why not bring us the keys as expected for a 5-star?

,872992288,"We stayed at the resort in November, 2022.  We used the airport pick up service they offer and had no trouble with that or with the check in process.  The room was nice and overlooked the ocean.  The resort is still in the process of recovering from Typhoon Odette, so there was construction going on which meant some noise and some closed off areas.  This caused the only issue we had --a door that was being used by the construction workers would slam extremely hard every time they used it, shaking the wall in our room.  I spoke to the front desk and they did try to remedy the issue.   Overall the stay was very nice. The staff was outstanding.  I've never had an experience where the staff was as polite and friendly as the staff at this resort.

,872749593,"Dusit Thani Mactan is a five-star hotel. As a hotelier myself, I expected five-star end-to-end guest service experience.

Unfortunately, Dust Thani Mactan fell below expectations. The food and ambience- great. We loved our Christmas Eve Dinner at Benjarong.

Most of the staff was great, except for the Chef in-charge at the omelette section of the breakfast buffet at the Tradewinds outlet, who argued with his assistant in front of me while I was waiting for my egg omelette.

What was off-putting and very disappointing was when we requested to have our dinner and breakfast billed to our room. For both instances, the staff told us ""we will check if that's possible"" only to tell us a few minutes later that they cannot do it! So we have to return to our room to get our credit card.

What an inconvenience! The lady at the Breakfast Buffet lobby didn't even look sympathetic at all-what we got is the ""it's your problem, not mine"" vibes. I don't understand why a five-star hotel cannot bill-to-room meals by checked-in guests.
Why are they making this inconvenient for us, I cannot fathom!

Isn't it the point of a Five-star rating to have a cut-above-the-rest guest service experience? Is this the Dust Thani Guest Service standard: to refuse a checked-in guest's bill-to-room request and actually choose for the guest to walk back to a separate building to get the credit card? 

I mean we are in a resort, and as guests we don't think it's practical to bring our credit cards and wallets all the time, right?

If Shangri-la Mactan can do it for us, why can't Dusit Thani Mactan? Both are five-star hotels. I worked at a five-star hotel abroad and I cannot understand, both professionally and personally why Dusit Thani Mactan would allow such inconvenience to their hotel guests.",3.0,2022-12-25,0.5,dusit_thani_mactan,dusit thani mactan fivestar hotel hotelier expect fivestar endtoend guest service experience unfortunately dust thani mactan fell expectation food ambience great love christmas eve dinner benjarong staff great except chef incharge omelette section breakfast buffet tradewinds outlet argue assistant front wait egg omelette offputting disappoint request dinner breakfast bill room instance staff tell u check thats possible tell u minute later return room get credit card inconvenience lady breakfast buffet lobby didnt even look sympathetic allwhat get problem mine vibe dont understand fivestar hotel billtoroom meal checkedin guest make inconvenient u fathom isnt point fivestar rat cutabovetherest guest service experience dust thani guest service standard refuse checkedin guest billtoroom request actually choose guest walk back separate build get credit card mean resort guest dont think practical bring credit card wallet time right shangrila mactan u cant dusit thani mactan fivestar hotel work fivestar hotel abroad understand professionally personally dusit thani mactan would allow inconvenience hotel guest,0

,871469014,"The Dusit Thani resort in Mactan has far exceeded the standards of most other resorts, and I should know. 
I am a former employee of the Hilton Corporation and have had held many hospitality positions in my career. In this field I have visited resorts in the US, Thailand, and the Philippines. The Dusit Thani wins. Here is why:
The guest experience is finely curated from the first step onto the immaculate grounds, to the pools, and even the restroom facilities, which are difficult to maintain. The restaurants are staffed by crews of well trained and resourceful staff members who truly take pride in their jobs, you can actually see their smiles even beneath their masks! 
I write this review today after several particular examples of phenomenal customer service by these staff members. First, my ATM card was declined at the ATM on site which caused me some distress. I needed to go to town and the taxis only take cash. One employee Nikki, recognized my dilemma and gave me taxi fare from his own pocket with nothing but trust that I would pay him back. 
Second, I went to dinner at the amazing Thai restaurant. I was greeted with a friendly smile and placed at a beautiful  table with a complimentary anti oxidant drink, and a cold hand towel. 
After perusing the menu, I didn’t find my favorite Thai dish, beef pad kra pow, and ordered some other items. My server Mardie immediately went to the Chef and asked if they would make my favorite dish, which he happily agreed. It was delicious!
During my meal, Clint, Mardie, Trisha, Jeffery and Kirby made me feel like a very special guest, and if I had a resort, I would try to steal all of them away. Lastly, even though management works mostly behind the scenes, it is obvious they are working hard to ensure thar the guest experience lives up to Dusit Thani standards.

The signature purple sweets/ cakes arranged as welcome compliments so creamy and tasty. We are all so in love with it. We also had the club lounge access which we don’t need to worry our snacks throughout the day. The restaurant that serves breakfast offers delicious international and native cuisines and all restaurant staff were very friendly and attentive, in addition they surprised my baby girl a lively birthday song during our meal. You have to visit their Thai “Benjarong” restaurant as well, as it has the most authentic and best Thai flavors you’ll surely love, thanks to Jeffrey, he’s very professional and knows what’s best for our appetite and love to mention, they greeted and sang a happy birthday to little girl during our dinner ( something that we haven’t expect!) .

,869943217,"Overall I found the Dusit Thani Mactan to be more like a 4-star property. It is very average and not at all value for money I paid for the room.
- The architectural design isn't user friendly. Layout of bathrooms isn't functional. You end up wetting the whole bathroom while showering.
- Rooms are small for 32sqm. Lot of space is wasted in the entrance vestibule and area probably includes the balcony. The rooms are very small.
- Swimming pools weren't clean. There were some dirt and particles floating in.
- The 'beach' is not a beach as such. Completely rocky. Huge challenge if you go swimming / snorkeling. 
- The view from Sea View Rooms is not bad, though beyond the sea, you see the island of Cebu so the view isn't infinite.
- The food was just average. Service was slow.
- Staff, just like everywhere in the Philippines, were very polite but not trained very well. A lot of construction persons were using the guest lifts very often. That brings to the fact that many parts of the hotel are under construction.
- The Thai restaurant - Benjarong - was awesome, including taste, awesome presentation and super staff!
- Location is far from anything around. Nearest place where you can get some groceries / convenience store is Newtown, around 10min drive.

Paul, Adrianna and Manolitte who made the perfect mojito for the wife (less sugary) at The View Lobby all were accommodating and engaging. We shared a good laugh!  The infinity pool is one of the best we have seen,  well maintained and clean. Everyone has amazing smile to share. Although the location is out of the way, it will only take you 12-15 mins drive to Mactan Newtown.

The OK stuff: My wife has difficulty making a reservation to drive direct business in the hope they would do price match from a 3rd party booking site,  sadly every attempt was denied and so we ended up booking via Agoda. The Breakfast team was very attentive on our 1st & 2nd day, not unitl my wife had breakfast on her own and pretty much was ignored. No one came to ask ""can i get you some coffee"" or ""would you like some water"". I believe this needs to be address and educate staff further to deliver equal customer service, regardless of the stature. Please also look into the bar fridge's temperature.

The resort’s spacious design, modern open air high ceilings, infused with Thai culture that beautifully integrates the Mactan Island Cebu Strait's coastal horizons as you enter the registration area of the property is just simply breathtaking!

Dusit Thani, which translates to “Town in Heaven”,  is a Thai owned resort, integrating Thai culture with the local Cebuana culture & people that makes for a beautiful blend for excellent hospitality that is focused to please resort guests from all over the world.

For my experience, All the resort’s personnel, from the concierge, front desk, housekeeping & room service, etc., Just to name a few, provided 5-star luxury customer service to fulfill and accommodate my requests to the best of their abilities 24/7.

However, one incident that was completely out of their control  BUT affected my balcony sea view  during my stay 10.10.22-10.14.22 as there was a “huge” cargo ship stuck in the coral beds near the beach line of the resort.  This was the unfortunate result of Super Typhoon Odette (Dec. 16, 2021) that directly hit the island of Cebu.

When I mentioned this to the front desk staff, I was fortunate to talk face to face with the Duty Mgr. Cecille Jane U. Aristan and she completely understood my point of view and was determined to make my stay more enjoyable despite the cargo ship “eye-sore” on the property beachfront.

Within a few minutes, Cecille invited me & family members to experience the VIP Dusit Club Lounge for the remainder of my stay and it was fabulous! The attentive waiter/Bartender staff (Gerson Purgatorio, Kevin Labay) and chefs (Rufa Mae Soria, Irise Sheila Tagnipes, Kent Jules Deovino) were excellent providing the best customer service experience I’ve had on this Cebu Trip!

I would also like to give a shout out to the Concierge (Earvin) and the Activities Staff (Jade, Cindy) for arranging such a wonderful tour of Cebu City & Mactan where we enjoyed learning about the local culture & historical points. (Lapu-Lapu monument, Guitar Factory, Taoist Temple,The Heritage of Cebu Monument, Yap-Sandiego ancestral house, 10,000 roses, etc.)

In closing, I would recommend this 5-star resort to my friends & family as well as other world travelers that are up to experiencing a once in a lifetime stay in beautiful, beachfront Cebu, Philippines.  I look forward to my return trip and stay @ the Dusit Thani as well as another invite to the fabulous Dusit Thani Mactan Cebu resort & their VIP Dusit Club lounge (Make it happen Cecille!! : ) in the near future after all renovations have been completed!

Benjarong features a blend of traditional taste and modern culinary technique, prepared before you in an open kitchen.  The next day, I had a good buffet breakfast at Tradewinds Cafe where I enjoyed a lot of amazing pastries and buffet international flavors. 

Right after, I chillax at the pool and then had a good lunch (buffet) at The Sports Bar, where you can relax on the deck sipping sunset drinks, playing billiards, catching the big game, and enjoying live entertainment.  Then, in the afternoon, I had an amazing one-hour Spa treatment at ""Namm Spa""; which I'm so recommending especially if you want to destress.

,858284623,"We stayed here for 4 days booking a premium club lounge room and summer staycation package. This hotel has several issues the first being a lack of communication. They did not inform us that the club lounge would be closed for the duration of our stay (in other words we paid premium for a service which the hotel knew they wouldn't be delivering and they had not notified us about it either. Secondly upon arrival our initial email said to check-in at the club lounge however we were told it was closed and to wait at reception in 28-30 degree hear we waited 30mins at reception as the hotel had only 3 staff serving a long line of 12-15 people and strangely they did not have a single fan in the whole reception area - quite shocking for a hotel that calls themselves a ""5-star"" hotel, in my books it was more like a 3-star hotel. However that wasn't even the worst part. From day 1 all the way to day 4, we had to constantly remind the staff that we had booked a special package inclusive of drinks and canapés and everytime we went to redeem it, none of the staff knew what was going on, each time we wasted 20-30mins explaining our package to the staff, which was 20-30mins less of being able to claim our limited 2 hours of happy hour. Furthermore, ordering any food or drinks involved a consistent 45-60min wait for it to arrive. Whilst there were 15 wait staff standing around doing nothing only one was making drinks, either the staff are unqualified or the hotel doesn't want to pay to train their staff. Either way this meant you could only have a max of 3 drinks in any happy hour session as the bartender was not capable of making any more than that. Furthermore, the room that the hotel had given us on the first night was not the premium king sized room we had booked. Instead it was a room facing the slums of Cebu. The staff failed to tell us that because we had arrived 30mind early our room was unavailable and instead without any communication whatsoever they placed us in a smaller room facing the slums rather than the premium room we booked facing the pool and spa. Mind you this all happened in just the first four hours of our stay but it certainly set the tone for the rest of the trip. On day 2, first thing we did was contact reception to speak to the manager about all these issues, it was not until then that the manager told us that our room was unavailable only because we arrived 30mins early and that's why they placed us in a smaller room which was not the room that we booked. The manager gave us a 30% discount at the spa however this only involved spending more money to redeem that. We note that the manager did not respond or address any of the other issues at the hotel. Food at the hotel was heavily overpriced for the quality and service, a mere burger and fries for 2 and two cocktails costed us around $65AUD. In Australia this kind of food is usually less than $40AUD and is of gourmet quality unlike at this hotel. The most annoying thing above all was having to constantly carry cash around to pay each restaurant at the hotel and we felt that staff wouldn't serve you within 40mins unless they received a tip and sometimes even if they did it wouldn't guarantee fast service. Finally, the only perk of the hotel is it's infinity pool however most of the time all the seats by the pool are full as they also allow day guests and often towels run out too.

,853778053,"The property is old and there is a lot of renovation work going on in the resort. The rooms were smelly and I had to get them to clean the bathroom twice as the bathroom floor was not cleaned well before we could check in . There is some open drain in the room which was quite smelly . I have a feeling it is from the sink in the kitchen area . Furniture is old , and nothing fancy to call the room 5 star resort . The bathroom door doesn’t close well , so the water kept coming out of the shower enclosure and messing up the other area . The food options are very limited , and their specialty restaurant was quite a disappointment with respect to the taste of the food . The staff everywhere was quite welcoming and warm though . 
The room service was taking forever . Even a bottle of water takes 15 mins at least to get delivered . The bottles of water they provide are 350 ml and you would end up taking more of those bottles as they are too small . Being such a big brand , they have not been environmentally conscious . They are on using small single use plastic bottles for everything.  It is unacceptable . Would make more sense yo have a water purification plant on the premises or use bigger bottles to give water . The cost of everything is unreasonably expensive for no damn reason . And they are all excluding VAT which is something new we saw.

,853245352,"We went to Cebu and stayed at the Dusit Thani, the hotel was good but some works were being carried out due the damage from the recent hurricane (I think).
The hotel itself was big though in my opinion a little secluded and out of the way. If you want to stay here and get around then hire a car or scooter, we hired a scooter so was good for us, if you just want to stay and relax then all good.
The swimming pool excellent with great views. There was a boat not so far from the hotel that had been washed up by the recent hurricane which I’m sure will be salvaged soon enough.

,847307723,"The hotel is at the end of a peninsula on Mactan island and pretty much isolated from rest of metro Cebu. The room was fine…nice sea view with balcony. King  size bed was really comfortable. The quirky bathroom had a shower with separate tub and no door leaving a wet mess in front of sink. 
The lobby, dining areas, huge infinity pool and beach were really appealing. Considering the devastation of the recent typhoon they have made quite a comeback.
Now, I give it just 3-stars because of food and service. The breakfast buffet was very good—nice assortment of breads, meats, fresh fruit and eggs dishes. Meal Service  was mostly quick and friendly. The other meals were off the menu and were bland and way overpriced. For example the “Greek” salad was a concoction of chopped up tomatoes, cucumbers, green peppers with barely visible feta cheese and olives served warm. 
Room service in this caliber of resort should be performed daily without request but it was not—even when requested.
Other missteps included charging our 9 yo for breakfast buffet when it was including in the booking; charging my Visa card in US dollars when Pesos were specifically requested resulting in an exchange skewed in their favor; telling us, in front of our visiting relative, that we must pay 1000 Pesos because she went in the pool.

,833445060,"The hotel had recently opened from
The typhoon and so there were limited options around. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Unfortunately for food there was only 1 menu available at the time of our stay so it was sports bar food for lunch and dinner for 3 nights :(. The pool was great and the beach was nice too. The kids club was a bit of a let down - not totally open and you have to pay per hour, but I was told that there was no air con inside it ‘due to Covid ?’ and so didn’t use it (it was one of the reasons I chose this hotel).

,830652463,"Was super excited to visit this hotel after a year away from my Family 
What a disappointment!!!
The hotel
It’s self is in a bad way the damage from the typhoon last year has not been addressed instead there are miles of Caution tape everywhere reception is at a makeshift desk handrails are missing from walkways and from stairs.

Check in was as unpleasant as the building it’s self
No greeting no smile very much pushing to upsell and upgrade.

Once at the room we were shocked at the fact it was so unclean and the smell of urine emanating from the bathroom was disgusting 
This was brought up with housekeeping and the manager but to no avail and we were left to clean the room and bathroom ourselves.

The pool is nice but unfortunately someone had vomited in the kiddie end which was never cleaned during the day after bringing it to the staff attention 

During breakfast there was no decaf coffee available unless you pay extra no tea available unless you pay extra.
The staff in the restaurant are very good and very helpful especially Imee who tried so hard to help and make everything rite.

There seems to be a lack of customer care with the management and the feeling is to upsell at every opportunity.

Having spoken with the manager twice regarding the concerns it was decided it’s better we move to a different hotel which he had no objection to and quickly cancelled the remaining days of our stay.

Very unprofessional approach to guests and unfortunately this is what is been fed down through the staff.

It pains me to have to write such a bad review but feel it is important to share the experience with others.

Hopefully this can be addressed and this hotel can reach the standards of other Hotels in the Dusit Thani Group",1.0,2022-03-09,0.0,dusit_thani_mactan,super excite visit hotel year away family disappointment hotel self bad way damage typhoon last year address instead mile caution tape everywhere reception makeshift desk handrail miss walkway stair check unpleasant build self greet smile much push upsell upgrade room shock fact unclean smell urine emanate bathroom disgust bring housekeep manager avail leave clean room bathroom pool nice unfortunately someone vomit kiddie end never clean day bring staff attention breakfast decaf coffee available unless pay extra tea available unless pay extra staff restaurant good helpful especially imee try hard help make everything rite seem lack customer care management feel upsell every opportunity speak manager twice regard concern decide better move different hotel objection quickly cancel remain day stay unprofessional approach guest unfortunately feed staff pain write bad review feel important share experience others hopefully address hotel reach standard hotel dusit thani group,0
,830225341,"Considering how typhoon Odette had devastated the island of Mactan, I have to give 5 stars to Dusit Thani Mactan for being one of the few resorts on the island that have been able to get back on their feet again. 

The staff at the hotel is very kind, efficient, and caring. 5 stars for their attentiveness. Props to Matthew who checked us in very quickly at 9PM when we arrived.

The pool is gorgeous and overlooks the ocean. It is very clean and well maintained. The problem I think are the people who come on day tours. Some of them are loud and rowdy with kids who can be a danger to themselves. Suggestion -- please put signs by the poolside that guests be in proper bathing attire, and that NO shouting, shoving, or rough play be allowed by the pools.

The restaurant is beautiful especially at sunset. The wait staff are nice, and knowledgable. The entrees though need to have more variety. I ordered the inasal and it was excellent. So were the frozen mojitos. 

Their famous Thai restaurant Benjarong was closed due to repairs from the typhoon. It would have been great to have the Benjarong menu available at the main restaurant.  There is a buffet available at one of the restaurant but since we are still living in the time of COVID, I thought is would not be prudent to do so. There is a deli that serves good coffee and okay sandwiches. 

Bonus tourist attraction is a huge barge that was washed very close to the shoreline of property. Dusit beachfront though is so-so.

Rooms are large and very comfortable. The bathroom in our room though had a ""lumot"" (moss) like smell that was coming from the toilet bowl.

The resort is located on the far end of Mactan Island so be prepared to stay in because it's far away from everything else. My daughter and I stayed in for three days and two nights and we did not get bored.

As I walked round early morning talking with fellow residents and staff and working out what we could do I thought I would see if the Dusit was open and much to my relief and surprise they were looking at taking some people in despite damage to parts of the hotel ...a number of us checked in with an indefinite exit date until our places were back up and running which ended up taking a month or so. 

I cannot  thank nor praise the GM , Michael and all of the Dusit team where despite the difficult circumstances they made our 'refugee - like' stay a complete pleasure and I was hugely impressed with how they pulled off memorable Christmas and New Year Eve parties with great food and good humour - much needed antidotes to the ongoing challenges with the tidy up, restoring power and water runs required  on the domestic front.

Besides, i gave my PRC card at the check in counter and for sure Mr Erickson saw me female in flesh. But why, in the big screen I am MR. MARIA PRESA APARIS (pics attached). 2. Mr. Erickson at the check in counter said, the extra bed will be set up later. I said no worries because we will not sleep yet but will take a dip in the pool. Sad to say, we came back to the room after 4 hours and my bed is not fix yet. I still have to call and  follow it up. We are 3 in the room but only given 1 shampoo, 1 lotion, 1 liquid soap, no face towel and only 1 hand towel. Mr Erickson at the front desk said the high tea will be at 4:30-5:30pm at the mezzanine floor. But when we reach Mezzanine at 4:30pm women at the front said it starts 2:30pm-4:30pm. Why is it your crew does not have a consistent answer. When I heard those 2 answers inconsistencies i was like "" so this means i will be eating leafovers"".Worst because the suppose Mezzanine lounge was close and we are transferred to have the high tea at the view lounge.Mr. Paul at the view lounge said that the mezzanine was close because only a few of the residents will have high tea. And what frustrates me is the very long waiting time for the suppose high tea. I said suppose high tea because what was served is not a high tea set up.The suppose unlimited cocktail is also set in the view lounge. And upon check in, Mr Erickson said that in the  unlimited cocktail lots of food will be serve as well that you wont crave for dinner. With this being said, my expectations were so high most especially that I just came from Pearl Farm Resort in Davao and I know Dusit is at par with Pearl and the service there were so great. So sad to say, my expectations perilously drop when after more than 3 hours of waiting our food is not serve.The beach time is set until 5pm and they only have 2 umbrellas with no shades at all to hide under the scorching heat of the sun.Together with me is a senior citizen and sad to say its not elderly friendly area.The pool towels are old yet the incharge does not allow me to bring it to our room. I got angry and said, ""you want me to go up to my room wet and water dripping in the elevator floor? "" He replied, because we still need to wash that one Mam"". what a reason. In Pearl Farm, their towels are new, and very soft. Yet after using I asked, where will I place this? the crew answered, just place it there Mam and we will be the one to get it. I am making this review for them to improve their service. More so to have a good review and encourage more people to come or be back to the place.

 The staff at the hotel are undoubtedly its greatest asset. Their eagerness to assist and friendly demeanour greatly enhanced the overall experience. many of them even addressed my daughter by her name, which surely made her feel special and welcomed.

The water in the sea was crystal clear, offering a picturesque view. However, it is unfortunate that the mornings were marred by litter, requiring the staff to clean it before guests could enjoy the beach. This highlights the dedication and commitment of the staff to maintain a clean and enjoyable environment for everyone.
 What i didn't like was the children's activities were dependent on the weather and if there were any events on the boardwalk.  The hotel has a great playroom, however it is filled with inflatables only.  This is darkly lit in some areas and not well ventilated.   As there is a fee to join this playroom it would have been nice if there were other activities available for children including arts and crafts, shell crafts, and educational sessions about cebu sea life through colouring  for example.  This would be more engaging for children.

I found the sand was not real and hard for children to play with. Additionally, it would be great to have more tents / gazebos to provide shade for children as sun protection is essential.

It is unfortunate that there weren't many healthy choices on the menu.  Considering it is a family resort i didn't see a dedicated children's menu.  There were also no vegan or gluten free options.",6.0,2024-06-20T01:57:59+07:00,0.5555555555555556,dusit_thani_mactan,staff hotel undoubtedly greatest asset eagerness assist friendly demeanour greatly enhance overall experience many even address daughter name surely make feel special welcome water sea crystal clear offer picturesque view however unfortunate morning mar litter require staff clean guest could enjoy beach highlight dedication commitment staff maintain clean enjoyable environment everyone didnt like childrens activity dependent weather event boardwalk hotel great playroom however fill inflatables darkly light area well ventilate fee join playroom would nice activity available child include art craft shell craft educational session cebu sea life colour example would engage child find sand real hard child play additionally would great tent gazebo provide shade child sun protection essential unfortunate werent many healthy choice menu consider family resort didnt see dedicate childrens menu also vegan gluten free option,1

 We like how the staff treated us respectfully from check in to checkout. Everyone did a great job especially Christine at that check us in and Zee and her supervisor that took care of us at The View Lounge. The place has a lot to offer. Several dining options to choose from. The pool was the best part. The beach access was easy. The boardwalk was really nice to spend time and wait for sunset. The suite room with sea view was spacious for a family of 5 and we love the view from the balcony.  It was fairly clean as well as the restrooms. Included breakfast buffet did not disappoint.
 Room 2516 was hot when we came in and we thought the a/c was just turned on and still adjusting the temperature to our preferred setting. Voila! 3 hours later, the temperature inside the rooms (bedrooms and living room) remained at around 24  degrees Celsius even if we tried to set it up to around 20-22 degrees Celsius. We called front desk and they sent someone to check the first time and said just try to give it few minutes to adjust now. We closed the curtains to try and cool the rooms down without too much heat from the sun and we went to the pool for a couple of hours. When we came back it was still hot. We called front desk back and they sent somebody back the second time to check but nothing happened. So, we decided to just let it be since we were checking out the following day anyway. 

About 18 of us ate at Tradewinds during their Seafood Night Buffet with an agreeable price of around $34-$39 per person converted to US dollars. It was very disappointing because with that price they only offer WATER as your drink. Anything other than water adds up to your bill! What the heck is that? What kind of ""1st class"" buffet only comes with water with that kind of price? When we told the supervisor on duty our comment about it, he doesn't seem to care! Did not even comment back or even tried to do anything about our comment. 

The lobby was super hot as it is an open environment. The place needs more fan. At The View Lounge, their was only 1 fan shared by several guests there, We were not lucky enough to have it pointed on us until other people left about 9pm!

 Great resort with the standard resort amenities. Decent private beach right behind resort. Loved the beach dinner event with buffet. Staff were always very super helpful and nice (though sometimes confused as different staff could give different answers).
 There was a corporate event for almost the entirety of our stay that blocked off several areas that would have been nice to enjoy. There were some noisy events in the evening but nothing super disruptive. Wish the beach was slightly nicer (or at least shuttles to nicer beaches) and there were more organized resort activities. We were told we had two double beds but they ended up being two twin beds. Wish TV allowed Netflix. TV was also broken - the screen would periodically go black so nothing watchable.",9.0,2024-06-04T06:17:21+07:00,0.8888888888888888,dusit_thani_mactan,great resort standard resort amenity decent private beach right behind resort love beach dinner event buffet staff always super helpful nice though sometimes confuse different staff could give different answer corporate event almost entirety stay block several area would nice enjoy noisy event even nothing super disruptive wish beach slightly nicer least shuttle nicer beach organize resort activity tell two double bed end two twin bed wish tv allow netflix tv also break screen would periodically go black nothing watchable,1

 Okay, the location was a little on the further end. The staff was helpful and courteous, the accommodation was clean, and they gave us a free upgrade to a wonderful seaview.  Their large bed is the most comfy. We had a wonderful breakfast buffet option. Many hours were spent in their infinity pool. The area was kept up and kept clean all around. The Korean restaurant was rather good.
 We would prefer to watch Netflix or YouTube on their big screen TV, which is not an HD TV. I had to use my personal data wifi to complete some work because the internet was also sluggish. I like to play pool with my partner, but their cue sticks and billiard table weren't in great shape. We ordered pizza, beverages, and cocktails from Sunset Bar, and we felt it was decent considering the hotel's pricing.  We decide to get the most costly massage we have ever had since our final night. The service at NAMM SPA was appalling. It was a major letdown. After spending almost 10,000php on a 90-minute massage each for the two of us, we were dejected as we left the spa. The service was poor; there was no selection of oils given, and while the package claimed peppermint, I didn't smell any. When we first came, the room was unprepared, it was hot, and the air conditioner was hardly operating, they had to open the door. I coudnt breathe so I had to question the therapist why the AC was not working and room door is open. They moved us to another room they claimed was full where AC was working better. But I was already not in the mood.  No hot towel to wipe oils out of our body at the end of massage, feels like staff were in hurry to just go home. No choice of having tea inside the room after the massage but instead found the tea outside in the lobby. The massage itself was good and I would be happy to pay 799 for that service instead of 4800++/head .

 Dusit was an amazing stay as I went here for 2 nights alongside my partner. Firstly I'd like to shoutout Ruth, Zee and Leo for their amazing service, they were so welcoming, kind and showed fantastic customer service throughout our stay.

We found the resort to be incredibly big with plenty of things to do to pass time, as I had the opportunity to snorkel for the first time out on the beach area. The pool is very nice, long and well maintained, with lots of tanning chairs to relax in the shade and sun.

We signed up to the Club Lounge experience which included the buffet breakfast, high tea and drinks in the evening. This was very much worth it and you end up saving a lot of money compared to buying the food and drinks separately without this discount, so I highly recommend this option.

We were able to get a nice couple of workouts in the gym as well, with their being enough equipment to complete a competent workout routine with what was available. Although the flooring wasn't the greatest, and a lack of wet wipes to wipe down the equipment after use, that didn't attract from the overall experience.

Finally the room we stayed in had a very lovely view of the Cebu sea and resort. The bed was big and comfortable, and the air conditioning had lots of options for temperatures, my only complaint being it was a little too close to where the visitors sleep. The bathroom and balcony areas were also really nice and clean.

Overall Dusit deserves its 5/5 rating and we both thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and would come back to relax here in a heartbeat.

 Breakfast was very disappointing. They seem to be trying to make a buffet with the cheapest food possible. Considering the price to stay there this is unacceptable.

 Did not have much western food as compared to other hotels/resorts in Cebu. However, the staff was very helpful and attentive,
 1.  The lobby was an open air lobby. It is not advertised as open air. At a resort most people want to enjoy the outdoor facilities but when inside you want to be comfortable and not continually exposed to the 104 degree Fahrenheit heat index.

2.  On the Sunday night of my stay, someone had rented an area for some function.  The music this group was playing was way too loud. My room was on the 5th floor and sounded like we were in the room next to the party. When I called the front desk to ask about the noise I was told the music/ function would be going until midnight.  When the music continued to interfere with us trying to sleep, I called again and asked to speak with the Duty  Manager. He said he would speak to them.

 The facilities are outstanding, our little one loved the kids play area. Staff and management very open to negative feedback and act quickly to resolve problems.
 Speed of service was an issue. Once had to fetch my own drinks 20 minutes later after ordering from the pool.

 Wow Dusit Thani! We have stayed at many 5-Star resorts, but rarely see one so dedicated to visitor services and enjoyment as Dusit Thani!! We used Dusit Thani as a “hub” for our travels in the Philippines due to the proximity to the airport and distance from hectic downtown Cebu City. We stayed three nights in total, two of which were in the Governors Suite (Room 2517) in Building 2. The room was excellent with a top floor view over the pool and channel separating Mactan and Cebu City. A hostess named Karen helped us with all our needs and exemplified what Dusit Thani is all about-visitor service! The hotel also had a staff nurse named Will that was very helpful with our condition. The food was top-tier and the breakfast buffet was the best I have ever seen and worth the stay just to enjoy the breakfast. Our room also entitled us to a private club that served free drinks and tapas.
 One bad thing we must point out. We stayed one night in a Club Room in Building 3 and the entire building and room smelled of mildew and was too hot out to open the windows. Yuck! Not sure if this is a persistent problem or not, but bad enough for us to never stay in that building again.",10.0,2024-05-04T22:59:57+07:00,1.0,dusit_thani_mactan,wow dusit thani stay many star resort rarely see one dedicate visitor service enjoyment dusit thani use dusit thani hub travel philippine due proximity airport distance hectic downtown cebu city stay three night total two governor suite room build room excellent top floor view pool channel separate mactan cebu city hostess name karen help u need exemplify dusit thani aboutvisitor service hotel also staff nurse name helpful condition food toptier breakfast buffet best ever see worth stay enjoy breakfast room also entitle u private club serve free drink tapa one bad thing must point stay one night club room build entire build room smell mildew hot open window yuck sure persistent problem bad enough u never stay build,1

 It's a great place with spacious and clean room with a fantastic view (if you paid for Seaview). Beds, shower etc are comfortable. 
An extremely large infinity pool, not too crowded even though it’s a big resort. It feels relaxing and the drinks near the pool are affrordable.
The restaurants are excellent, the breakfast buffet is very very good (my wife liked the Taho man, you can’t find him anywhere except at Dusit), the staff is fantastic.
 We stayed here before, end of 2022. The feeling between then and now is that there are less amenities in the room. No laundry bag, only two towels, limited cans with shower gel and shampoo and the conditioning was even missing. Looks like the hotel is doing their best to be good for the environment while they also think about saving money to keep the room price affordable during this period with high inflation. Not all decisions are bad but two towels and no conditioning while all the Filipina’s with long hair use it…….thats a wrong way of saving money. We called the reception and additional shower gel and shampoo was delivered, should not be the case.

 It really is a fantastic place. A very large resort area with multiple restaurants and bars, all of them good to very good. A decent private beach (as some reviewers mentioned the water is too shallow - maybe just check the tide times and have a swim when it's high tide, it's totally fine then). An extremely large infinity pool so it looks like it rarely ever gets crowded and feels nicely relaxed. 

The restaurants are excellent, the breakfast buffet is very very good, the staff is nothing short of fantastic.

Bear in mind, as some reviewers mentioned, this is a resort in a rather secluded area. You'd need a taxi to get anywhere else, unless you're fine buying stuff from nearby Sari-Sari stores or grab a beer with some local guys in a scruffy bar (which I'd actually recommend for a change of scenery). The resort character is exactly what you're here for though and you can see the location beforehand, so I don't see what's to complain about it.
 In general, the only noticeable minus is the pricing. Sure, this is a high-end resort, but even for that category it's pricey and at times feels like it's simply too much. Accommodation price seems justified, but for example prices for drinks or seafood buffet are definitely very high, and seem hard to justify on this level.",9.0,2024-04-18T06:10:56+07:00,0.8888888888888888,dusit_thani_mactan,really fantastic place large resort area multiple restaurant bar good good decent private beach reviewer mention water shallow maybe check tide time swim high tide totally fine extremely large infinity pool look like rarely ever get crowd feel nicely relax restaurant excellent breakfast buffet good staff nothing short fantastic bear mind reviewer mention resort rather seclude area youd need taxi get anywhere else unless youre fine buy stuff nearby sarisari store grab beer local guy scruffy bar id actually recommend change scenery resort character exactly youre though see location beforehand dont see whats complain general noticeable minus price sure highend resort even category pricey time feel like simply much accommodation price seem justify example price drink seafood buffet definitely high seem hard justify level,1

 We had a pleasant stay. The staff was fantastic! They were incredibly accommodating to our 1-year-old, and the room was spacious and comfortable. The breakfast buffet was excellent, and the BBQ buffet was also quite good. The playroom was a big hit with our little one, though it was surprising to find there was an extra daily fee to use it.
 While the breakfast and BBQ buffets offered good variety, there weren't many options for toddlers outside of those times. It was disappointing that the evening buffets weren't always available.

 Upon arrival, the space was extravagant - it was spacious, clean, and simply beautiful. The staff greeted us, and we started to get a glimpse of how exceptionally and seriously the staff took hospitality. From then on, we were greeted with a smile and a hello or good morning by the workers every day, and this made us feel very valued and seen as customers. Their hospitality was at times almost too much, but I suppose its only a good thing to say that the service was too good, or the people too nice. When dining, they saw the smallest details, and truly made our stay feel very special. 
The dining itself was very good. For the breakfast, they have a variety of food that fits both Asian and Western tastebuds, which was great for an interracial couple like ourselves. I liked that we could have our breakfast outside on the terrace and enjoy the views of the ocean as we ate our breakfast. The swimming pool is very clean, big, and we liked that we could order food and drinks by the pool area. 
For the room, it was much better than expected. We liked that it was just as the picture, if not better. The bed is big, the bathroom is nice, and the view is gorgeous - it was very satisfactory. 
We tried the spa facilities, and it was very nice.
 The location is not good. If you believe that the resort can provide everything you need, and that you will have no interest in leaving the resort, and exploring what Cebu is actually like for normal people - then don't worry about what I'm writing. The location is near the airport ... and that's about it. If you're staying there for a longer time, and get tired of the same food, same vibe, and same activities every day - the location doesn't have many other options for other things to explore. My suggestion would be to book an island hopping tour to get out and see some of Cebu, if you can afford the expensive options the hotel provides then go for it, it's a great way to get outside the bubble of the resort. However, these tours all mean that you have to drive for hours to get to the main sights, so if you're someone who wants to do water activities, or go sightseeing, I'd suggest a place in the city or somewhere near what you want to see. 

I wish there was a convenience store in the resort or a small booth that can provide products such as period products, or cigarettes. I called the room service line to ask if they were able to provide period products, or if that was something avaliable to buy at the resort, but unfortunately it is not.

 My stay at Dusit Thani was a great overall experience. The staff is extremely friendly and professional, the facilities are in excellent condition and the overall ambiance is also very nice, calm and relaxing. The pool is nice (it could be a bit deeper for my taste but it is ok), and the resort was not too crowded (I was there in the second week of February). Breakfast, lunch, and dinner can be taken at a variety of bars and restaurants, all of which had good food and a great view. The photos of the property really do reflect the place well.

On a side note: the fitness center is quite nice and one can get a decent workout in between relaxing at the pool and dinner!
 The location is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it is close to the airport whilst not being affected by airport noise. On the other hand the road infrastructure there is less than excellent, and depending on the traffic it can either take 20 minutes or 90 minutes to get to and from the airport. Also, there isn't much around to see. I was planning on relaxing in the resort so this did not bother me at all, but if you want to explore a bit on foot it might not be the most exciting area as you have to take a taxi/grab to get to the next best starbucks.

 nice interiors, 
good wifi
clean (big praise to the cleaning staff), 
the staff, in general, gives the appearance of being there to assist. 
the front office did try to resolve our issues by offering some extra when we brought up the issues we encountered
 Despite being 95% full occupancy, they did not have enough loungers set out by the pool. Unbelievably, on the first day we were told to sit on chairs(!) by the bar instead of arranging for extra lounges to be brought to the pool. In the following days, we raced to the pool to get a spot; not what I would expect in a 5-star resort.
Cocktails were constantly a hit-and-miss.
Every single time we wanted to order something they seemed to have run out of items. One day I wanted a smoothie, but I almost had to settle for Coca-Cola instead. How does a 5-star hotel run out of bananas or coconut in a tropical country when they are sold at every corner?! Every morning for breakfast there were bananas in the buffet restaurant but there were none at the pool bar for an afternoon cocktail or a smoothie(!?) How does a 5-starts resort run out of nachos and Royal (Fanta)? These are all items on the menu, not fancy requests of a spoiled customer. I don't believe these are hard-to-get or delicate items that cannot be stored for a long time. To then be told that it is because they had lots of customers for the Chinese New Year was the cherry on the cake. As if the event came as a surprise and they could not prepare for it. No one wants to spend so much money to travel this far (bear in mind the place is well isolated) and then hear such a sad excuse. All of this wouldn't bother me too much in other circumstances, but it is less acceptable in a 5-star hotel that puts on so much of a show.

 The hotel is at a lovely location, once you get to it. We arrived at Mactan via ferry, and the hotel was an hour's ride through heavy traffic and some narrow streets.  Same narrow streets en route to the airport, but only a 30-minute drive. The infinity swimming pool is huge, about 100m long, and it was not too busy during our visit. The view across the sea to the mountains on Cebu island is lovely. The breakfast had good variety, but the cooks at the egg station had the smallest pan possible, a huge queue at the station, and were trainees: we never got properly cooked eggs and the wait was very long. The restaurants all (aside from the (fancy)Thai, on the second floor), all had outdoor seating and views of the sea.  The feather pillows and duvet are super comfy!

The location is a bit out of the way but the facilities are great and you feel like you’ve entered a luxury resort the moment you arrive. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.

 Amazing pool and enjoyed the evening shows. Epic view of the sunset. Food at the sports bar was delicious and loved the vibe of the staff and the great drinks served at the lobby bar
 Unfortunately I would not recommend (and in fact discourage) anyone from staying at Dusit Thani due to the extreme dampness of the rooms. We stayed in tower 3 and the room was extremely cold with staff having set the aircon as low as possible. When we turned the aircon off we discovered why - the room dripped with condensation and there was a strong smell of mold. My partner and I both left with terrible sinus infections. We did not ask to move again as we had already been shifted from another room where the toilet dripped and there was loud construction noise until late at night outside our room. Our friends stayed in another room and also had the smell of sewage in their room.

 From beginning to end: horrible stay - avoid this place at all cost

1. Room
Without asking, and without being told, I was apparently upgraded to a better room upon arrival. However, the room I was put in, which is building 3, was another level of disappointing. Sure, the room is spacious and had an ocean view but unless the AC was put on high at 20 degrees the room would start to literally sweat. water dripping from the walls, completely wet floor in the bathroom/toilet which is dangerous as extremely slippery, bed sheets were wet after a while so were my own clothes. It took half a day and me calling about 5 times for the hotel to find a solution. By the way, their initial proposal was to downgrade me with little to no apology. The new room I was in, had exactly the same issue. The hotel is just not build well. They called the « engineering team » about 3 times which proposed every time the solution of simply putting the AC at 20 degrees: this is not a solution, unless you want your customers to all become sick and catch a cold.
Most funnily, the first reaction of the staff was to say this situation was because I left the windows open, which I did not: putting the blame on the client and letting them deal half a day in a humid, wet rooms that smells like you are in an underground cave is not the best.

2. Room Service
Ordered a greek salad and a burger. The burger first came without the steak patty in it: so just buns and salad. The salad had half of the things mentioned in the menu.

 The hotel exceeded my expectations. The open lobby had a beautiful tree out for Christmas. There were a few varieties of places to get drinks and food. Not many local food options for lunch and dinner, but I am not a foodie, so I didn't mind the more international choices for food. The pool is spacious and I never had an issue getting chairs at various times throughout the day. I loved that the pool was open late, until 10 pm. The breakfast was great - so many options for different types of food & lots of local food options to try.
 The location was quite remote. Honestly, I did not mind this at all. We barely left the hotel grounds beyond going to eat in Cebu City one day and for massages at Cacao Tree Spa about 10 min away. There wasn't much to do close by in Cebu City as a lot of the attractions are further away on the island. It took about 30 min to get to the airport and about 45 min to get to Cebu City because of traffic. The hotel is very helpful at getting taxis when you want to leave the hotel. If you get stir crazy, maybe not the best hotel choice. I enjoyed the hotel itself because it had enough to keep me occupied and feed me for my vacation as we were aiming to relax and hang out.",10.0,2023-12-25T04:29:57+07:00,1.0,dusit_thani_mactan,hotel exceed expectation open lobby beautiful tree christmas variety place get drink food many local food option lunch dinner foodie didnt mind international choice food pool spacious never issue get chair various time throughout day love pool open late pm breakfast great many option different type food lot local food option try location quite remote honestly mind barely leave hotel grind beyond go eat cebu city one day massage cacao tree spa min away wasnt much close cebu city lot attraction away island take min get airport min get cebu city traffic hotel helpful get taxi want leave hotel get stir crazy maybe best hotel choice enjoy hotel enough keep occupy fee vacation aim relax hang,1

 The food is quite pricy for the taste/quality. The beach is very small and not sandy as promised. I guess therefore few people are using it (which is good if you like it quiet).

 Staff that will just say “yes ma’m,” with arrogance, instead of “sorry,” when you make a disappointing observation. As if to tell you, that’s how five star hotel works and have to deal with it. They charge me the full price of my 3 nights stay as a security deposit(my stay was already fully paid before I arrived), booking.com states the security deposit will be 3k pesos, when I asked them about why full price, they told me it’s gonna be back to my account at check out, at check out, Kevin the front desk person told me, when I inquired, it’s gonna take 2 weeks to return to my account, didn’t asked me if I needed help for my luggages and just turned his back as soon as he told me I’m all set. I’ve been hauling our luggages without anybody helping us, they’ve just moving on and pretending they don’t see me and my companion, I’ve seen them full force with foreign guests. You have to bring slippers for the bathroom, the design is weird, water floods all the way to the adjacent toilet bowl and it’s gonna be wet all day, have to open the window when you take a shower, ventilation doesn’t seem right, windows will be covered in mist/fog. The place is secluded from the modern(convenience store) amenities. If you’re the kind of person who stays in the room, at the bar, at the poolside, you’ll be ok. But if you need something else, getting a grab ride will take a while, they have a hotel taxi which can cost a lot. Thy have free shuttle going to Robinson’s galleria(2x a day), free shuttle to a mall but not to the airport.

 If Heaven on Earth exists, The Dusit Thani certainly feels like such a place. The sunsets, atmosphere, absolute carefree environment. Resort is brand new, ideal for a couple that wants to do nothing but spend quality time together. The pool is amazing, with stunning views of the mountains and ocean. It is like a movie set. I have stayed in resorts all over the world, its not that this was the fanciest place, it is that the staff here is so very special. Warm, Attentive, friendly. I guess if I worked in a paradise like this, I would be happy everyday. The breakfast buffet is very special. The fruit here taste like nothing we have in the US, homemade organic honeys, juices, out of this world. Thai rest also, amazing, wonderful experience. The pool bar food, also excellent, loved the pizza. The oceanview room is a nice large size, with a great sized balcony. The room has a great fridge also. Some thanks you's to Wonderful staff, Enan, The rest. Manager, Ravi the Chef, Friendly Mary, part of the breakfast team, and Niki from the pool bar. No amount of money is a big enough tip for these wonderful people here. My girlfriend and I will be back to the Dusit Thani sometime this year, and I cant Wait.

 The pool was lovely and the staff were very friendly.
 the shower flooded the whole bathroom floor and outside the door even if taking a short shower. We reported this to the front desk but no effort to fix or change rooms. the hotel had very few guests and yet ran out of towels by 10am and we were told more towels would be dropped off at 11.30am. the music at the pool was terrible. loud and more suitable to a night club than a family resort during the day.",5.0,2023-03-14T14:59:37+07:00,0.4444444444444445,dusit_thani_mactan,pool lovely staff friendly shower flood whole bathroom floor outside door even take short shower report front desk effort fix change room hotel guest yet run towel tell towel would drop music pool terrible loud suitable night club family resort day,0

 1) Resort is really nice.  The view bar area is truly a great spot to hang out.
2) Staff were extremely friendly to myself and my mother who are from the US.
3) Service was exception for myself and my mother who are from the US.
4) The infinity pool is quite a treat.  
5) There is a kids play area that is indoors which we didn't know about until we got there.  It was really fun for our 4 year old son, and they do provide supervision at all times while children are playing in the area.  300 PHP for 1 hour or 600 PHP for the full day.
 1) My biggest issue was the service to my wife and mother in law who are native to the Philippines.  They were guests just like myself and my own mother, but when I was not in the vicinity of them.. the service was a completely different experience.  The staff would not do simple things like refilling water at the table, and they would not make eye contact and engage them either.  I remember returning to the resort after island hopping carrying a bag full of snorkeling gear and not one person even asked to look in the bag.  That same bag the prior day when we returned my mother in law was carrying it.. and when I was not with her entering the resort they made issue of it and searched the bag.. and made her go through a metal detector. (as another example)  My wife was quite upset with this fact, and it bothers me as well.  Every guest should be treated with the same level of service.  
2) There is a corkage fee to bring a single bottle of wine from outside into your room, and that was 1500PHP per bottle.  What was surprising about that is you can purchase a bottle of wine in their deli at the resort for 500-700PHP on the low end. The front desk agent told me that the bottles in the deli  were all 1500PHP.
3) Could not find spa service pricing anywhere online for the resort spa.  The only way to see pricing was to go to the spa when it was open and come to find that the prices at the resort spa are the same price you would pay in the US for full body massage for example.  You can take a taxi to two nearby spas (5 minute drive) and only pay 27$ US for a full body 90 minute massage.  Quite interesting that they don't advertise the pricing considering this fact.
4) There really isn't much beach front.  There was a tiny manmade beach one one side of the resort, and it was not appealing at all.",5.0,2023-03-09T16:47:44+07:00,0.4444444444444445,dusit_thani_mactan,resort really nice view bar area truly great spot hang staff extremely friendly mother u service exception mother u infinity pool quite treat kid play area indoors didnt know get really fun year old son provide supervision time child play area php hour php full day biggest issue service wife mother law native philippine guest like mother vicinity service completely different experience staff would simple thing like refill water table would make eye contact engage either remember return resort island hop carry bag full snorkel gear one person even ask look bag bag prior day return mother law carry enter resort make issue search bag make go metal detector another example wife quite upset fact bother well every guest treat level service corkage fee bring single bottle wine outside room php per bottle surprise purchase bottle wine deli resort php low end front desk agent tell bottle deli php could find spa service price anywhere online resort spa way see price go spa open come find price resort spa price would pay u full body massage example take taxi two nearby spa minute drive pay u full body minute massage quite interest dont advertise price consider fact really isnt much beach front tiny manmade beach one one side resort appeal,0

 It could benefit from more options for food as well as a place to purchase convenience store items.

I mention more options for food because the Sunset Sports bar is very underwhelming in its service.

 Bed was comfy, food was good and plenty. 
Nothing else there is too like.
This hotel nowhere a 5 star resort and shouldn't even be carrying the prestigious name Dusit.
I need to comment Kevin who has been doing a great job in the beach bar and serving us at the pool. Good job..
 Low quality materials used for the way too small rooms. Rooms looks like a 89$ city hotel and not like a 5 star resort room you charge $300 per night. It's completely laughable. If you present such room to travelers in Bali, Phuket or Phu Coq you might have a riot at your hands. This hotel only exists to cater to Korean tourists. Every expat or local who knows what a real 5 star hotel is like will avoid this place like the plague. We are so disappointed.
No balcony, view is facing an ugly blue condo bldg.
No shower separation, water runs free in the bathroom like in a cheap roadside motel.
Upon arrival bags were taken out of our hands without a greeting, not a word. Handed a luggage stub. NO WELCOME DRINK, nothing.
The worst unhelpful concierge ever. Unprofessional behaviors by staff all 3 days. Waiter asked me at the view bar where I'm from, when I replied that I'm German he said "" oh wow, that's from where Hitler was, that very bad president, I saw Schindlers List and needed to cry"" Excuse me ??????
Coffee and hot chocolate are served without saucer. Dishes at the pool ignored for hrs even dozens of time staff passed by. Hot chocolate for 250 pesos which is just Swiss miss and no hot chocolate.
Does the manager ever do a walkabout on the premises? Trash everywhere in the garden, same as swimming tissues in the pool and whatnot..I'm completely speechless.
I stayed in Dusit hotels over, just recently in Davao and BKK which both were fantastic in terms of staff and room etc. This place is nothing but an unprofessional overpriced tourist trap for Koreans.
Upon check out of course no receipt was given. He didn't even put the SOA in an envelope to hand it to me, he simple kept it. No OR. Hello BIR?

 1) Staff is friendly and tries to help within their boundaries
2) Price range is within my budget given I am not willing to pay too much when most of the time i am not in the hotel. Other hotels like shangri-la or Shenton would have been too pricey. However it is still steep and comparable price to certain 5 star hotels back in Singapore
3) Availability of services like Pool, dining in restaurants (given the distance to everything else you may wish to have a nice dinner in the hotel after a day of tours), 24 hr room service etc.
 - Digital TV with the channels did not work for 2 days which I always like to turn on as background noise when I am in the room.  No attempts at service recovery though its not a huge matter for me since I am not always in the room. A simple later check out time even by 1 hr would be nice but no such offer even though I asked for one.
- Walls are super thin. At 1 point I can heard our next door neighbors having their conversation as though they were standing right next to me. I feel bad since I have early days (4am hours) and getting ready would have disturbed them.
- Taxis are a challenge. I had to wait sometime for the hotel to get me one. However when I was at Shangri-la (for lunch) they seem to a couple of taxis already on standby. I guess the difference in price do show.
- Provided towels in the room are bare minimum, ie 2 towels for 2 guests for showering. 5 star hotels usually provide separate towels per guest for washing of face, additional shower towels sometimes etc. In a way I supposed its more green ..
- Wife could not find the hair dryer in the room so likely housekeeping forgot about it. When we had it sent up, it did not work...
- 2 very small bottles of water to last your day.

 Dear all

I would like to write you this e-mail, to share with you my disappointment regarding my stay in your hotel.

First of all, I want to let you know that we are travelling for the last 28 days as we are honeymooners and we visit more 3 continent and more than 8 cities and hotels and this was our unique misadventure.

We checked in on Feb 6th and our room was great but without a view nor a balcony and despite of the fact that I informed the hotel that we are honeymooners, you just did a bed decoration upon request on the second day. 
We kindly asked the reception to move us to a room with a balcony and they find us a king size bed room with a view but it would be better if not.

Our room now is 3410 and is way downgraded compared to the 2505.
The bathroom floor is wet since yesterday night and in some places dirty, the walls are wet also because of the humidity, and on the top of it the pillow smells moisture and the towels are extremely used.

My wife is allergic, spent a horrible night, and this is really irritating.

I strongly recommend you send your team to the room to acknowledge how critical the situation is.

 Infinity pool was really beautiful, overlooking the ocean. There are sufficient daybeds for the number of guests in the hotel and lots of other lounging areas around that overlook the ocean. Rooms are also well furnished, beds are really comfortable with bathtub for use.
 Hot water in the room isn't hot at all, showers at night were really cold.

Food - service is slow, at the sunset bar, food takes 20-30 mins to serve even when its not crowded. Quality of food across all the restaurants in the hotel also leaves more to be desired. For the amount they are charging, I think they can do a much better job with the food - pasta, korean dishes, thai dishes were all lacking. Only the burger was decent

Service - service in general is inconsistent. Some staff were really friendly and welcoming, but some weren't very helpful. I left my Fitbit watch in the spa on the last day and only realised when I was at the airport.

 We arrived at the hotel around 11 pm, once opened the door… the smell of mould and humid was terrible. They tried to move us to another room ( half of the size, and with the same issue) so we decided to stay… the day after we woke up with humid everywhere… even the ceiling was wet!!!

 we paid a very high fee due to the holiday season and I feel like it was overall overpriced, especially when we had to extend our stay due to flight cancellations (on account of what happened at Manila airport)

The spa is particularly luxurious and it was very easy to get a booking. 
Staff that were especially amazing include Lovely at the Deli, Gabriel at the front desk, and Jahil and Tina at the sports bar.
 There was a lot of construction going on, which meant the main lobby bar was basically unusable. Unfortunately there is a big tanker that sits right in front of the sunset, so we didn't get the sunset views we were hoping for. I'm not sure if it is because it was low season, but the only food options were the sports bar and the thai restaurant. The service was inconsistent, sometimes good sometimes bad.

 Nice pool
 I was dissappointed with this hotel. I booked a 32m2 room at this hotel with bathtub, but when I checked in they gave me a very small room.
- This is a 5 star hotel, but they did not even have welcome drink, What a dissapointed service.
- They have flyer that there is free shuttle bus to Nustar resort and casino, but when I booked it, they said it`s not available on weekdays. If like that, you should make better advertisement. I am not sure if it`s only on weekend or it`s just a lie because there were no passengers.

 The building is new though there were still parts being repaired or renovated due to the previous year's typhoon. The staff were very accommodating and pleasant to the guests. The pool was great, it isn't too deep especially I cannot swim. And there is a lifeguard to ensure safety. The spa was awesome, though you need to book beforehand. Thai restaurant on the 2nd floor served delicious dishes with fresh ingredients. Bar on the ground floor also served good Filipino dishes. They also have really good breakfast. Though I missed it, I heard they serve taho (silken tofu) during the weekends in a very traditional Filipino way of serving i.e., with a vendor carrying taho containers on a bamboo pole on his shoulder and yelling ""taho! Taho!"" 😍

 Nothing much really. If there's one thing worth mentioning, that would probably be the attentiveness of the reception staff.
 This resort is overrated compared to other 5-star facilities in Mactan (e.g. Shangrila, Plantation Bay and Solea). Nothing is special about it except for the bigger pool that they boast about. The rooms are poorly maintained (toilet walls not wiped clean, bathroom doors and wardrobes are not in good condition - I couldn't close my bathroom door at all!). Pillows are not comfortable enough and had some pungent smell (smells like urine) on them. The food they serve (via room service) are super expensive but not really tasty.

 Didn't take breakfast... wanted to leave.
 It already started bad, during check in.. requested a extra bed during booking. During check in said was an extra 2k PHP. So said on website state, kid until 13 is free of charge. Then there was suddenly no upcast anymore, but needed to pay for breakfast. Okay no problem... So I said, why do you not ask before making any comment.. or check her passport yourself. So I asked, is the extra bed in the room or not.. she said no... Finally when to the room, guess what.. the extra bed was there. Only the extra towel wasn't. So when going for dinner, passed by the reception, and said.. well your info is not correct, the extra bed is there, only one towel missing. Her comment.. maybe they did do that during check in.. I said you are really funny ;-). 

Dinner in the 'The view"".. well that's another story... Ordered food. A chicken Soup, which was the highlight of the stay, as the simply was really nice and good. Unfortunately needed to ask after ± half hour when my food would be served, but first needed to catch the attention of at least 7 people staff, who were having a great time together chatting and laughing but not paying attention to the few tables. My food was served... but when ingredients are present which you do not eat, which are not specified on the menu, is not helpful. 

The fact that there are works, due to the typhoon Odette is normal and they try to minimize. The fact that a big ship broke loose during the typhoon and now is within ocean view scenery is bad luck for them... so I suggest, look left on your balcony.

The best part and smoothest one, was my request earlier checkout. That was smooth, quick, efficient and friendly. First time they performed up to the standards, and of which I am thankful how they did handle and process.

 The breakfast buffet was excellent. Lots of choices in breads, meats, eggs etc. The pool was fantastic as was the lobby area . Considering the significant damage caused by the typhoon, the resort was in good shape. The sea view rooms are excellent and it is in an isolated location. Staff was friendly and helpful, but somewhat incompetent as well. See below.

 Really disappointed with the property. We were put in building three where we were met with a very damp smell as soon as we entered the building and our room. Once we lay on the bed it was evident that the bed and bedding was also damp. We complained to reception who told us they had no rooms in another building but could move us to a new room in the same building. So we agreed which smelled lovely but left for dinner for a few hours and upon returning to the room we were met with the same damp smell. It was clear to us that the staff had just sprayed the room with air freshener. We complained once again and magically they had a room for us in the other building.

 The TV in room and movies option was good. Some of the staff we friendly and some could work on being friendly.
 False advertise, there was no fitness centre, even though was stated that it was available on website. Spa room unavailable but only option was to be done on bed which was not ideal. Bufet was not best and food cold, was off putting. To much yellow caution tape around and put me off a bit. Noise in night, think construction and you can hear through walls quite easily and hallways.

Restaurants all serve the same menu, that was rediculous for the price to stay at resort and food was quite expensive I find for what I was getting. 

There was no house keeping for rooms unless you called for it to be service. Was not told on arrival but to find out when I saw a room being attented to. They said you need to call to prebook and it is due to pandemic. I was like really, or was it to minimise on cost. 

Was annoying to always call house keeping or hopefully catch someone in hall way if you cannot reach them. 

There was no Managment on site to talk to at all, no Duty Manager. Reception can only listen and help as far. 

Beach closes at 5pm, was told no life guards around that time, pool closes at 8pm even though it is 4 foot pool all around. Was told is to service the pool but there are guest who are not kids are would like to enjoy the pool a little later than earlier.

Kids are in same pool as adults, a little noisy. Would of liked to enjoy a little peace and quiet by the pool and not kids running up and down.

 The property is beautiful.  Just a renovation work in progress, since they’ve been hit badly by typhoon Odette.  It was a busy weekend, being a long one since it was a holiday in Cebu.  Service is wonderful.  Restaurant for dinner was at the Sunset cafe temporarily, since the typhoon, so not all items on buffet needing warmers had it, so some were cold.  My table reservation was given to somebody, disappointing, but accommodated with my demand to be given what was available/reserved for a different group who didn’t arrive.  They were busy, and staff still coping…needing improvement, but staff are all kind and hospitable.  Beautiful rooms, beautiful design of resort, well planned for the property they have in Mactan Cebu.  White sand beaches is not something to expect in Mactan Cebu, just an fyi.  But being by the sea is still calming and relaxing, and they have a nice huge pool.  Still a good relaxing stay over all.  I would come back.
